qbC4cfz-ShxEGpLS94Mk7Q I went out to dinner with a friend tonight and there were some ominous signs (too many to mention) that should have told us not to go to this place.

Anyway, we went into this cramped restaurant, where it was busy on a Monday night.  There was literally no space in some aisles to walk -- chairs were touching back-to-back.  I decided on the prix fixe, which was a decent deal with a starter, main, and dessert.

It took about 35 minutes for the starter to come up.  The starter was a salad, which was mixed greens with a light vinaigrette.  It was horribly uninspired and I'm not sure why there was such a wait.  Our bread did not come out until AFTER the salad.

After waiting another 30 or 40 minutes, they came out with our DESSERT!  We were like "we haven't had our mains yet!".  I couldn't believe it.  Another 15 minutes later and the steak frites comes out.  It was a nice flavorful flank steak with a veal reduction and quite appetizing frites.  Dessert (apple tart) was just ok, nothing to write Yelp about.

The total meal took 2 hours and 15 minutes from end-to-end (about 1.5 hours before we had our entrees), which was tough to take after seeing a number of groups come in after us and leave before us.  After forgetting our mains, I thought that they'd offer some sort of sincere apology or discount and all they did was remove the bottle of Perrier we had.  Maybe my standards for customer service at a decent restaurant are too high, but I was expecting more.

As for food quality, the regular menu must be a lot better than the prix fixe because I can't see myself spending the extra money for something of this level.
