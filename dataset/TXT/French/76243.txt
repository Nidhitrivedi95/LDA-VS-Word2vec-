Yp1swb-8pO8i-6-jaK2tsA Mimi's is a great place for good french style comfort foods.  We always go there with a BOGO coupon in hand which you get almost every week if you join their email club.
We nearly always have the same thing.  Ignacio loves the salmon over spinach with potatoes.
I like the large Turkey reuben sandwich and Uriel usually goes for a burger but this time he went for the grilled chicken sandwich we he said he would have again.
Service is usually pretty spot on and we have never had a complaint about the food.
