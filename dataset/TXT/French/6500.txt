4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw OK spot when someone else is paying. Great for business lunch if entertaining clients. Food is overpriced, but if you crave steak frites or a tuna nicoise salad with a view of the fountains, this is your spot.

BTW, I saw someone order the vegetable tagine, which sounded delicious on the menu, but it looked like a watery disaster when it came out. Would avoid that one and stick to the meat if possible. Definitely limited options for vegetarians.
