hzyvL2v97xLzLbLXcdi1uw Overrated. I admit I was stoked to come here after hearing coworkers telling me to come and all the shining reviews online. It's almost an hour away but I braved the frigid temperatures and traffic to try this out. Worth it? Absolutely not. 

Prices are HIGH and portions are TINY. I got the Mykonos French toast dish with 4 thin, dinky slices of "spicy" sausage. This was already $10 and I was not full or impressed. The French toast slices were thin and unseasoned without the syrup. The menu claimed it was butter maple syrup but those are lies. I just got a tin cup with regular cheap syrup. Hubby ordered the Bristol crepe ($10) but was afraid the portion would be too small so added eggs ($2) on top. He said the taste was good but it was way too dry. It claimed to have bechamel sauce but definitely not enough. 

I commented that the only authentically Parisian element about this place were the bathrooms. The door actually brushes against the toilet seat. This is all the room you get.
I'm critical because I've had delicious crepes in Paris and not only are they not very pricey, they are a silkier, buttery taste that is lost on this poor substitute in the U.S. It was dim, stuffy, crowded and run-down (or hipster style). I would not recommend this place or go back myself. Give me First Watch or IHOP any day.
