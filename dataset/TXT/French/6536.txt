4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Had never been here before Sunday night.  Right across from the Bellagio, you can sit inside or out on the patio and see the water show. I was with the guys, but seemed like a nice place inside for a romantic interlude.. darkly lit, with old world decorations and high ceilings.. believe there was a fireplace as well.. you get the picture.  We had a 40 minute wait for the patio.  Food was xlnt.    For cocktails the waitress recommended a French Martini, sounded good, tasted fantastic, but failed to check on cost and it was $12.95 for one drink!  OK it was super fantastic, (gee I need to make more money).. Shared a baked cheese appetizer, table loved it, I had the scallops with a pureed mushroom sauce, best scallops I had ever eaten. Think they were $23.. Lovely.. would not hesitate to return ..this is a steak house, but no one tried a steak, one guy dieting had soup, another had the fish and chips which was a flat fillet rather than the breaded chunky pieces you usually see.  Everything was excellent, bill was $180 for 3, which included 3 cocktails and 2 glasses of wine and a shared dessert.
