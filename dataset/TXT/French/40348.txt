KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA I unfortunately have to downgrade this restaurant to a 3 star and that is mostly based on location. 
Previous owners I have to say were 5 star all the way! 
Sadly the food and service is just not the same.
The food is good now but that is all just....good.
A glass of wine and a cheese plate overlooking the lake with a decent server is all I expect now of my once beloved Marche Bacchus.
