Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA This is another "can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet" place. Brasserie V has been one of our favorites since they opened. Foremost for me is the beer selection, which is one of the best I know anywhere, and I'm a bit of a beer hunter. Belgians are their forté, but they source great brews from all over the world. The staff knows their stuff, too. I never hesitate to follow their recommendations. You don't even need a taste, just go with it. 

The food is just as good as the beer, with a traditional brasserie menu that's very well executed. The V burger, steak frites, and moules et frites are favorites.
