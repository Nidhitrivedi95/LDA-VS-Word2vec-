E9HkUYYO_-5vKjvBwLuDIw Lucky find.  We were looking for unusual, different and not on the Strip.  Found it.  Lovely small, intimate place. Hip but comfortable decor. Staff attentive and felt authentic to customers preferences. Food was wonderful. My husband loves steak au poivre but is usually disappointed.  Not last night! He said the meat was superior. I had the pistachio goat cheese appetizer and a wonderful salad.  We will return.
