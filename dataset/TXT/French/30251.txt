FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Came here for lunch and first off I'd like to say the service was excellent! The host and waiters were checking up on our table a few times to see if everything was ok. I really appreciated that, considering the place was quite busy. The ambiance was definitely more high end and fancy but hey, food was delicious so the restaurant definitely delivered. I had salmon tartare with caviar and fries, the portion was generous for sure. Gotta love raw food! The fries were really tasty too. It was probably an expensive lunch, but I think it was worth it. 

Would recommend reserving for even brunch/lunch because when I got there (which was 11 AM on a Sunday) it was already pretty packed. Will come again one day to try their dinner menu!
