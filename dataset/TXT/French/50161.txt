ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw I strongly suggest getting reservations. I went there on a Tuesday evening, thinking that it might be an off day and just barely got a table. It doesn't matter if it is an off day or if it is lunch instead of dinner - get reservations. 

The staff is excellent, mostly. I was actually pretty pleased with darnwell everything...except for my server. The hostess was great. The food was beyond wonderful. Everything was just about perfect except that our waitress didn't seem quite interested in my two person table. Maybe she was having an off day or maybe she was just a snobbed up priss who didn't think that my working class casual table had money enough to tip, I don't know because she was literally at the table the bare minimum that she had to be. Ahh well. Every other waitress seemed attentive and kindly. One of the managers even made an appearance and was charming. 

The food is wonderful. This is a vegetarian friendly restaurant with plenty of options for folks that don't eat meat. Then again it even has snails and foi gras for folks that do. I was surprised by how reasonable prices were. You can get a gourmet panini on fresh bread for 8 bucks. Though none of the sandwiches come with a side. Side dishes (or "Accessories") are $3-4. I think I actually like ordering the sides separate better. There is a whole list ranging from mac and cheese to honeyed squash to choose from. The creamed spinach was perfect as were the plantains and squash. 

Next time I'll save room for dessert.
