UWupVhvb1qWZh8rNowJliQ We went for a late dinner after a show at the nearby Sony Centre. The service was very good and attentive. The atmosphere was cool and romantic. We had the Cordon Bleu and the Spaghetti and Meatballs. I would highly recommend the spaghetti and meatballs, the only thing holding me back from 5 stars was the Cordon Bleu which was a little bland. For dessert we had the nanaimo cheesecake which was excellent. I would definitely recommend Woods for a nice dinner date.
