xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g My husband and I had a wonderful experience at this restaurant. Michael our server was exceptional and the food was amazing. The manager even came over to see how things went. Very friendly, great service, amazing food and an outstanding view. We can't wait to experience it again. I was so happy to  that the restaurant was not part of the hotel ownership because the service at the hotel was horrible. I just hope that the restaurant is not perceived in a negative way because of their affiliation.
