ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw what a delightful place! we came here for my birthday and i felt like i was treated like royalty. we were seated at a great table to watch the amazing sunset and had the best waitress i've had in a long time, dani, i believe. my husband ordered the 'sidecar' bourbon cocktail with triple sec and lemon juice and man was it tasty? ice cold and served in a martini glass with a sugar rim... yum! and of course i had to get the french onion soup which was THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD! it was topped with a lovely thin bread and the bowl was plentiful with the most delicious onions -- mmm mouth watering just thinking about it. i had the eggplant parmesan for dinner and my husband had their special which was a sea-salt crusted yellowfin tuna with carrots and a pesto sauce which was delicous. we finished with the house chocolate cake. we will definitely be back -- highlights were the drinks and the french onion soup. MUST ORDERS!
