LtDYRcMJbJPhXPEklT29Fw Best Cleveland restaurant to open in a while! It sits in Shaker Square, and is staffed by "front of the house" and "back of the house" workers, some of who are transitioning from incarceration to a career in the food industry.  Heading it all up is Brandon Chrostowski, well known from L'Albatros, and his knowledge of food and service clearly shows! The food is supposedly "Industrial French", and while I don't know what that means, let's just leave it at this: exceptional cooking in traditional French style with an authenticity that is hard to beat! The lobster bisque is a delight, the braised artichokes are yummy, and I loved the strip steak and frites!  My steak was cooked perfectly and the pepper sauce was excellent. Mild complaint was that the fries were not as crisp as I normally like. My friend had the "Paupiettes de poisson", a grouper wrapped in crispy, thin sliced potatoes in a delightful sauce. I had a delightful bite of that as well, and the fish was moist and the dish succeeds. 
The restaurant has just opened so there were some rough bits to iron out; however, the overall sense that one gets is that the staff is well trained, and the kitchen is well run. My only quibble is with the "by the glass" wine list, which seems to be a work in progress. 
The decor is very refined and they have done a great job with the space. A cheese cart paraded by a few times and looked to have a varied selection.
Finally, I should add that the restaurant is part of an "institute/foundation" so that your bill comes as a contribution to a 501 (c) and is tax deductible!!!
I'll definitely be back!!
