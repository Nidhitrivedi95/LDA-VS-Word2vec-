rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A After a couple of nights of stuffing ourselves with four course dinners, my husband and I were delighted to go to Bouchon and just have a salad and steak frites.  Perfectly cooked and delightful in every way.  I have eaten at all three Bouchons now, plus the French Laundry and Ad Hoc, so I guess that makes me something of a Thomas Keller groupie.  I've never had anything less than a great meal at his restaurants.
