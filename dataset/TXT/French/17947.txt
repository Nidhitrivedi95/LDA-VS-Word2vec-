For tonight, I selected Forest Noir, cherries on top and cherries inside, a rich chocolate cake layered with thick Chantilly Cream. I admit, I had some trepidation about buying a cake to go from the refrigerated case. What to do?  I was in need of a cake. I relied on my previous experiences at Patisserie Manon, and yes, the cake was as sumptuous as all menu items I had savored from the bistro menu. Indulge. You will not regret the Joie de vivre!
