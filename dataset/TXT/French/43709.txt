M8r8_asmCqkcn9g23G7d9Q I'm always on the look out for new continental bakeries; as a modern european languages student, I need to act the part! This place is extremely authentic in terms of simple, quality French bread and pastries. The smell that greeted me as I entered the building was absolutely incredible, the staff were friendly, and I knew I had to order something quickly!  Though the bread looked amazing, I ended up getting an almond croissant and a cappuccino. The croissant was fantastic, and the filling tasted homemade, unlike those processed fillings found so often in supermarkets.

The only downside to this place is the size: it's really tiny! There are two tables, and I would kind of feel awkward about staying too long and hogging them. That's a shame, because I love buying a coffee and then hanging out to read or study in a place for hours. For this reason, maybe this would be a better place to take away.
