FUX9h1a37GJn9ge1baiNuw Very good authentic French cuisine. I lived in France for a while, so it's nice to find a place in Madison that does such a good job of capturing the atmosphere of typical restaurants in France. That being said, I'm not personally a big fan of French cuisine, so I have a little trouble objectively rating their food. They offer soups, sandwiches, quiches, and various pastries. From what I can discern, the quality is great and everything is fresh. The bakery items are wonderful, especially the fruit tarts and baguettes. Be warned: they only take cash...no credit cards allowed. I've gone when it's extremely crowded and there isn't a single seat available, but I've also gone when I'm the only person in the restaurant. Many of the staff are French, which provides a nice opportunity to practice speaking French, a rarity in Madison. I do recommend it, particularly for lunch.
