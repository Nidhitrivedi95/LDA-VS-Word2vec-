sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ Made it to E on Sept 2nd, 2011.  Get to this restaurant.  It's worth the wait/money/chance/effort to eat here.  20 servings, most of which I loved.  When you have that many servings, you are not going to like/love everything, it's impossible.   Loved most, loved that when you get the alcohol pairing, it is part of the meal as well.  Started with frozen Gin and Tonic, hated gin, but I love it now.   Where E feels better than all, is that you have a host that takes you thru the dinner and wine/cocktail/beer pairings.  The atmosphere was so comfortable that the entire evening was an event as opposed to dinner.  At anytime you can talk to the people plating the food, and talk to the host, and they felt so comfortable with you as their guests, it was like you were at your friends house for dinner.   The only pretentious thing may be the other diners and with groups of 8 only twice nightly you should be in good company.  We were in a group of 4, another cool couple from D.C., and a couple from Los Angeles.    4 people with pairing will be about 360.00 per person incl tip.  If you can do it....do it, it lasts about 3 hours and you will depart fulfilled.  5 Stars is for overall experience.  Food is amazing, but don't expect to like everything, but the people that present and feed you are why this restaurant is a must.
