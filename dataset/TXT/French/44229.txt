ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw We came here during restaurant week. It was our first visit to the restaurant and we were accompanied by friends who had been there before. Our reservations were for 5:45 and we were seated promptly. It was a corner 'booth' so a little dark and crowded. 

We were greeted by a friendly server who told us he would be helping us along with another server. She came by and poured water in our glasses, not introducing herself. For the remainder of the night it was clear that she was intent on getting us out of there. I am always mindful of when a server picks up the completed check from the table, which should not be done while the patrons are still at the table. This was not the case. In addition, we were asked for our credit cards BEFORE even receiving a copy of the bill. That did not sit well with me. 

When I asked for salad dressing on the side I was abruptly informed that no deviations could be made during restaurant week. I understood that, but her tone was condescending. 

The beef short rib was tender, flaked apart with a fork. Presentation of the food was nice. Creme brûlée was good, however I felt the portion was a little small. Also tasted the butternut squash soup which was good. Maybe due to restaurant week? 

All in all, the food not something I'd call outstanding. The service was below standard for a restaurant that claims to be fine dining.
