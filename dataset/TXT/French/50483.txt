OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA We were really excited to go to this place. Everything looked amazing when we walked in. However ,we waited more than 40 minutes to get our food , which was a sandwich and French onion soup . We ordered onion rings as a side for the sandwich and we got French fries because they said they were out of it , without letting us know beforehand , at least they gave us  a free desert because of that but still... The French onion soup was not good at all . I am disappointed .
