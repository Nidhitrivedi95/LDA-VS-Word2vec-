5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g We loved Rooster's for dinner so much on a recent visit to Charlotte that we came back and brought a group with us. All the menu items we tried were amazing and included: the bbq chicken, the scallops, the duck breast, the potatoes au gratin, a pasta dish with a 3 meat sauce, the fire roasted beets and the asparagus. Every dish was excellent, an appropriate serving size, and prepared perfectly. Additionally, the service was outstanding. We had Adam take care of us. He was knowledgeable and attentive, and did an outstanding job recommending which dishes to try.
