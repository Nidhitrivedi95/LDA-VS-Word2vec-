wPF-aYk0RRA3oOOxVnbMTg We were led to this fine restaurant by a poster for a festival of food from or inspired by Martinique, a French island in the West Indies where I lived for a few years a long time ago. About 20 restaurants were featuring one or two such dishes or drinks on their menus.  We picked this restaurant mostly based on its location -- it fit into our visitor itinerary for the day -- and we could not have been more pleased.  We were among only a few customers for a weekday lunch, and got extremely attentive service.  We sat in the small enclosed outdoor terrace, in the rear, as did all the other customers.  The Martiniquais dish for the day was advertised as cod fritters -- of which there are many versions from the West Indies -- but really it was elegantly served tender fresh cod in a succulent cucumber and coconut sauce.  The heavenly dessert was seasonal berries (straw-, rasp-, and blue-) in a reduction of similar berries.  This meal was the highlight of a too brief autumn visit to the city.
