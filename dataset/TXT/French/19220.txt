5 stars because I'm a very loyal consumer and a huge fan of the bakery. There are 2 locations in the hotel. I go to the one inside/adjacent to the casino.

Very good: warm croissant breakfast sandwich, house coffee, Banana cream puff

Not so favorite experience: Eclair (it was stale!), caramel macaron (my preference is for it to have less caramel filling)

Noticed: they don't seem to replace all their baked goods with fresh ones daily. 

Service: 
Very nice - friendly counter person who generously gave me the last 2 broken raspberry macarons for free (I purchased 6 as a gift already) - me and my 3 year old had a very nice treat! :)

Not so nice - brusque and aggressive counter person who scoffed at a sweet teen girl's unique name (not traditionally American) in front of me? The counter person continued to spread her negativity to other customers... she definitely should not have worked that morning!
