bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg I really enjoyed having brunch here. The food was delicious and the coffee was great. However, it didn't seem like the wait staff could handle the large crowd that comes for a Sunday brunch. Our waiter seemed flustered and kept forgetting about us. The hostess was even a little rude and short tempered. They didin't seem understaffed so I'm not sure what the deal was. I would definitely go back here but it would be nice if they had better servers who could handle more than a couple of tables. For this reason I gave Terrace 3 out of 5.
