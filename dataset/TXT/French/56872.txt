rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A While in town for the weekend with friends we decided to try out Bouchon.  Being a Thomas Keller fan and enjoying his creations I had really high hopes.  The menu comes wrapped around your napkin in a folded paper.  Out waiter was nice, but a little over the top for us and was a bit chatty.  Some people might like that, but not our group.  It made it a bit awkward for us.

I started with the beet salad and a selection of oysters.  The salad was yummy and the oysters were a fair selection from the waters of the north pacific.  I've had a better selection with better condiments to go with them.  The wine was fair, but I'm always trying new things and the waiter didn't have much input in my selection.  I had the lamb for my main entree and even though it was a smaller sized portion it still had a lot of great flavor.  You don't get that gamey taste, but just a full savory one.  The steak my gf had was delicious with the smothered butter and caramelized onions.  For dessert we had the profiteroles, which was a-ok.  Nothing like the foie gras profiteroles we had at le pigeon in portland, but just ok.

Would I go back?  Most likely, but I'm sure to try out some other places before doing so.
