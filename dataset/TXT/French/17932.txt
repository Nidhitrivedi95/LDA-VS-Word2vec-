A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g So many tasty sweets and sandwiches to choose from!So many colorful pastries(american style, obviously, since in France I've never seen these colorful goodies)!.
I had a ham and cheese croissant, along with an chocolate croissant and an vanilla chocolate eclair, everything topped with a small hot latte.
The ham and cheese croissant:pure pleasure for my taste buds!Amazing!
But(there are couple of them "buts"), the coffee was burned.Not the milk, but the coffee beans, so my latte was bitter.First impression with the vanilla eclair?Nice textures but way too sweet!I realize we're living in US, but the amount of sugar  overwhelmed the flavor of vanilla filling and the chocolate topping.
The chocolate croissant was very fluffy but again, the amount of sugar in the chocolate was way over the limit!
And then, to release all the flavors from the pastry, the croissant should be warmed, unless the customer says different, when on the table.
I'm in love with the sweets, I'm in love with crunchy crusty hearted bread and that's why I tried today this place, one of few french establishments in Vegas.Disappointed they're adapting the quantity of sugar to the american standards and customers instead of being the other way around.
P.S.The guy over the counter at the sandwich area called me two times dude :-). California's still dreaming-surfing I guess...
