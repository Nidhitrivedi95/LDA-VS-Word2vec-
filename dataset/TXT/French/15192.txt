63qPRnFAjxtchnSTWBxwbw Hungry after the 6 hour drive, we walked down to Rue Saint-denis for some poutine since it was near our hotel.  Waitress with friendly (this was our first restaurant experience in Montréal).  I ordered the poutine with the caramelized onions and merguez sausage.  The bf ordered just the classic poutine.  To complete the meal we ordered a pitcher or Boreale.  I wanted the Boreale noir, but the waitress said they were out, so the lager it was.

The poutine was very tasty.  The curds were hot gooey, and the sausage added a nice savory element to mine.  Overall, we were both pleased.  The petite portions were still pretty large and satisfying, so we ended up skipping dinner that night after this late afternoon snack.
