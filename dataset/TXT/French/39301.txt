jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg I was excited to visit this restaurant, my friend spoke highly about this restaurant. When we went the waitress/ hostess was very rude to us. She Embarrassed  us in front of all the other customers in the restaurant. This was our first visit. The food was not all that, I had fish and chips  My husband had a sandwich.    
We will not be returning.  The Owner needs to know that there waitress is running off there business.
