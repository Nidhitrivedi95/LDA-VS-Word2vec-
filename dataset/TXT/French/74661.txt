So it's Valentine's Day, traffic is terrible and I have 8:15 reservations here.  After fighting traffic and waiting in a loooong valet line, we go up to the restaurant and realized it wasalmost 9 o'clock.  Would you believe it?  On one of the busiest nights, they still held our reservations and it only takes them 15 minutes to get our table ready.  After being seated, our waiter serves us our choices on their V-day menu.  Everything tasted great, the second we finished something they took our plate, the restaurant was pretty, the view of the fountain was nice, and my wine glass never was empty until the end.  I already was thinking in my head to give it four stars (only because I thought it was just a bit over priced).  However, I ended up giving them five because of this...

My waiter came back saying what NO ONE ever wants to hear, "I'm so sorry, but your card was declined".

The room went black and I died (at least that's what I wanted to happen in that moment).  Immediately, I called my bank.  After having the worst experience on the phone with my bank again (review of Chase customer service coming soon, and it won't b,pretty) and not having any way to pay, I expected the worst.  With no questions asked, the waiter and the manager informed me in the kindest manner that they'll just do a copy of the card and my ID and to not worry whatsoever, to come back tomorrow was just fine and don't let this ruin my Valentine's Day.

Eiffel Tower, I loved your decor, food presentation as well as taste, the live singer and nice views.  But what I loved most was the superb customer service and understanding.  Thank you for not making me feel like such a cheap skate.  Will you always be my Valentine?
