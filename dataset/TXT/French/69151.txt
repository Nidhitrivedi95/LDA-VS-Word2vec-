w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A Stopped in last night after dinner in shady side. We were greeted with a warm "Bon jour" and the smell of delirious pastries.
The store is beautiful and the girls working there were both friendly and knowledgable.
After "window shopping" we went nuts! We order one of each of the macaroons and brought them home and cut them into 4's so we each could try
First one was the chocolate and basil.... I wish I bought more!!!
