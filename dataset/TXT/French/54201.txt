Bardot is both a solid brunch and dinner spot. The food is delectable, and the service is unpretentious. 

The three-course Las Vegas Restaurant Week menu may be more than enough food, but I'd suggest ordering an extra appetizer or two to share.

Appetizer - Escargots Bardot: Can't stand the sight of SNAILS? Well, these are wrapped in a puff pastry. These are savory, buttery, and delicious -- you can't eat just one. 

Appetizer - Seared Foie Gras Lyonnaise: If you've ever tried Filipino-style adobo, the sauce in this dish has a familiar adobo flavor to me. I wasn't a fan of the beluga lentils, but I liked the combination of foie gras and the prune confiture. 

First Course - King Crab Crepe: A crab and black trumpet mixture folded into a buckwheat crepe with a sunny side egg right in the center. Yum.

Second Course - Maine Lobster Thermidor: Truthfully, I'm not a fan of lobster, but I gave this a try any way and it was delicious. This was my first time trying this dish, and it reminded  me of a "dynamite" that you can order at some Japanese restaurants. I loved the mixture of the mushrooms, bernaise sauce, and the tender chunks of lobster meat. The creamy mashed potatoes were bomb; I wish I had a bowl of just that on the side. 

Third Course - Chocolate Macaron: Rich and decadent. This is a deluxe version of a regular macaron. Sandwiched in between chocolate cookies were dollops of chocolate mousse. Chocolate sauce and chocolate shavings topped it off. 

For French cuisine on The Strip, Bardot's my top pick. I cannot wait to return.
