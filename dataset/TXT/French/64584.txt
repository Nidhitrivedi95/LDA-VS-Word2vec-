Tefx_N6A6nrsdj4jHHnbYg will never go there again.  took forever and only to screw up my order. horrible service.  management does not care about customer service so good luck!  i ordered a ham/swiss and turkey sandwich which i was charged for and stated clearly on my receipt! when i reached home the sandwich had just turkey 'no ham and no swiss'. i left a 20 percent tip to add! called to inform them and management said i was charged appropriately even though half of the sandwich was missing!!! they put me on hold and came back to say..what do you want us to do!?! not a great way to start off with a small business. i should have followed my first mind and went to honeybaked ham! awesome service there and much better food. watch out medical center employees. avoid at all costs. rude management.
