uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg Top 5 entree I've had in my life after traveling to 32 countries and eating at Michelin starred restaurants. The pork belly had two light and sweet purées, plus a maple sauce. I melted in my seat. Worth a trip only to eat this dish. Seasonal, so make sure it's on the menu.

dessert (good, not great)
butternut squash soup (good, not great)

Service: friendly, family-owned environment
