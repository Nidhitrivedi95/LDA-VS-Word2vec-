SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA I had a great meal and dining experience at L'Albatros.  I was traveling for business and a physician I was working with and the shuttle driver, Amy, at the Courtyard Marriott, highly recommended the restaurant. 

I sat at the bar and this was a great decision because Gillian, bartender / server extraordinaire, provided excellent service, food and drink recommendations and interesting conversation.  

L'Albatros has a great selection of French, American wines as well as, wine from other locations around the world. 

I started with the Braised Leeks with Dijon Mustard Sauce and the dish was excellent.  You don't see leeks on the menu in the US like you do in France.  They were served cold on top of very good dijon dressing.

Next, I ordered the Radish and Cucumber Les Salades over mache with red onions and crème fraîche vinaigrette.  The salad was very good and different than something I would normally order.  The rest of the salads on the menu looked amazing too.  

For the main course, I thought that the Seared Sea Scallops with brussel sprouts, noodles and Pernod cream sounded good, but I didn't want noodles.  Gillian suggested substituting the noodles with hericot verts (green beans).  That was a great suggestion and I think should be a permanent option.  It is also cool that the bartender at a French restaurant in Cleveland has lived in France and speaks French.  (added bonus for authenticity)

I was planning on skipping dessert but the Crème Caramel was highly recommended and it did not disappoint.  The dense creamy flan surrounded by deep caramel sauce, a dollop of fresh cream and seasonal berries was amazing.  I'm glad I don't work there or I would eat it every night!
