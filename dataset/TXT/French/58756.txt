rrfe1RPh6t3QG7BRghzjYA I usually never write a review about a Restaurant Week experience because it's typically not their best food but we had such a great experience I had to rave about it! Tucked away next to the Starbucks, you might not ever notice it (used to be Terra) but it is a little gem! Named after the absolutely gorgeous city in the south of France, Aix en Provence, one of my favorites, I had high hopes for the food but hadn't tried it yet because the previous menu had a lot of cilantro on it. Thankfully I was not disappointed. 

Our server was Aaron and he was just about my favorite server I've ever had. He did not steer us wrong. We started with some really interesting craft cocktails we both couldn't get enough of.  We had the heirloom tomato salad on burrata, steak au poivre, and peach clafoutis. The burrata was actually quite mild and not as gamey as some Italian burrata can be. The "au poivre" sauce was a perfect accompaniment to the expertly seasoned steak. It was a solid 5 star meal all the way around. Just delicious flavors at every turn. Hubs had the smoked salmon tartine (on a baguette), duck cassoulet and chocolate ganache. It was delicious, decadent and satisfying. Through the evening, Aaron was friendly, attentive and gave us great suggestions. The interior left a lot to be desired (it was generic restaurant furniture with a few paintings of Provence) but the food and service definitely made up for it. 

We look forward to returning and when the weather cools off having wine and dinner on the front patio!
