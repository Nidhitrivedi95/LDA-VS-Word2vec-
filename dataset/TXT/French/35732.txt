hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg We sat at the back bar which I'm glad we did. It's quieter and you have more room. I highly recommend going with the chefs tasting! You get to sample a lot of the menu and try food you normally wouldn't. You will definitely not leave hungry! All the food we had tasted great & service was even better. We will come back for sure!
