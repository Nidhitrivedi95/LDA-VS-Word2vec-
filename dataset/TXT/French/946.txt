You know, apparently, in order to become a Yelp Elite, you need to have unbiased opinions. Which is asinine and stupid and completely ignorant, because opinions are inherently biased. Piss off, Yelp. 
My biased opinion is that the color scheme for this restaurant is gorgeous. Mahogany, brown, yellow, cream, and, of course, eggshell white. Honestly, it's perfect.
It took a bit of time to find the entrance. We ended up walking all the way up the alley, all the way back down, and finally found the door next to the outdoor seating. God, what geniuses. 
Ordered French Onion Soup (my favorite food, along with Hot Pot and Gogigui) and Croque Madame. (You know, French Onion Soup would be a lot better with Feta cheese instead of Swiss. But I guess I'm too biased. It was good.) The Croque Madame was cooked perfectly, with a runny sunny side up on top and cheese baked all around the bread instead of in between. Brilliant. Fries were cool too. I like how small they cut them. It's nice. 
Geez, I love French food. It's almost worth giving this place an extra star just for that. (Suck on that, Yelp.)
4/5.
