yenHHL1QMjj2iAiYu6TRyQ What a disaster this restaurant is. A friend organized her birthday party here. I had never heard good things about portovino, but it was out of my hands. 

You can sense the pathetic attempt at high class from the moment you walk in. I noticed overdressed west island people all ready for their weekend outing. Well portovino is bad even by west island standards. 

The service was bland and unpleasant. 

The food was bland and unpleasant as well! Every entré (appetizer) is 15-22... Seriously...? 17$ for an Italian sausage with tomato sauce? I ordered pizza, it was cold and boring. Everyone around me was rather unimpressed. 

Think of L'academie, but less good and more expensive.
