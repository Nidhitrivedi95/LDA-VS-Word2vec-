oXSnH3yxo4qMPHtLjEdwFw Went here for a large group dinner. Food was very good (highly recommend the rack of lamb). Staff were very friendly and accommodating. 

However, the acoustics in this restaurant make it really hard to have conversations. They accommodate groups... But it seemed as if you could hear every single one of the dozen groups' conversations from your seat! 

Prices were around $40 a head and the restaurant is a BYO
