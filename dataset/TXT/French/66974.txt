USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg The wife and I have eaten here twice in the last year or so. Both times have been great. It seems like this place has a reputation as being a special occasion restaurant, and that was proven last night as everyone seemed to be having a birthday celebration around us. The first time, we sat inside on the second level, but last night we were on the covered porch facing 7th street. The idea of eating outside appeals to me, but rarely is Charlotte weather just right for the wife and I. I would sit outside in the snow while she would love the heat of the summer. The weather last night, while humid, was still pleasant for both of us so we had to do it.
The service, like last time, was great and attentive. It always leads me to eat too much bread as they keep coming back to offer more. The bread was perfect to clean up all the sauce that came with the escargots that we shared as appetizer. For mains, the wife got the wreck fish special and I the salmon off the regular menu. Every component on my dish was flavorful and both fish were cooked perfectly. The wife did mention her overall dish was under seasoned, but hey we can all stand to eat a little sodium once in a while. We split some decaf french press coffee and the blackberry coffee cake to round out a great meal. Oh and I almost forgot the adult beverage choices. I just love their bourbon smash which is the perfect mixture of bourbon, maple and orange flavors. I really need to figure out their recipe. The wife got a Sancerre by the glass and loved it.

My advice to anyone, don't wait for your birthday. Get on over to Fig Tree and check it out!
