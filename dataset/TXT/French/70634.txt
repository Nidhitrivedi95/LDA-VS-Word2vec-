xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q First time here and we loved it! The place is small but spotless and lovely decor. Has a definite Queen St West vibe to it :)  We went with our boys (7, 11) and had savoury crepes: 3 of us made our own and my husband had Santa's omelet. All of them were delicious: mine was spinach, egg, mushroom, tomatoes and they recommended the dried tomato pesto with it (perfect). We drank watermelon juice and had a chance to taste the fresh pressed sugar cane juice which was amazing. I definitely recommend this place, it's a wonderful experience. A note re. Seating - they have about 5 high seat tables which seat up to 3 people each - we pulled two together for a party of 4. 

Next time we'll tide our bikes here and get takeout for a lovely picnic in the park. 

Oh and... The people who work there are lovely.
