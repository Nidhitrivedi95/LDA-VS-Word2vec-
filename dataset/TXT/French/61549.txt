SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ My favorite restaurant. If I could give 6 stars I would. I always get something new because their menu is always changing. As a person who sticks to the same thing all the time you'd think this ever changing menu would be a bad thing, but every single new thing I try becomes my new favorite. The atmosphere is quaint and clean and classy. It's a refreshing place to eat. Great drinks, great food, great staff. And for the love of God, get something from the bakery.
