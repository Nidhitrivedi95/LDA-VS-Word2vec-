JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g I took my parents here when they were stopping through town since they love french food! Parking was a bit tough, but we found side street parking a couple blocks away, which was fine since it was during the summer. We sat on the small side of the restaurant across from the kitchen, and it was a small table, but comfortable enough. My parents enjoyed a soup and salad, while I had the roasted chicken croissant. It was a flaky and delicious croissant, and had mango chutney on it, which was totally different but yummy. After our meal, I had a latte with soy milk while we chatted. I've been to Paris before and can say that this place definitely reminded me of the cafes there!
