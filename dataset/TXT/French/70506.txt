xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q Finally had a chance to try out this place! 
I ordered two crepes, one savoury (Mama Mia) and sweet (El Paradiso), and I would say I'm blown away by both, esp. the savoury one :D Mama Mia was really satisfying and delicious. The staffs were very welcoming as well.

I came pretty late, so there was only another group of people there and there was no waiting and it was quiet. 
Will come back to try out all the other savoury/signature crepes and to get my stamps for free 10th crepe!
