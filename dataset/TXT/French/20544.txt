AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw This is excellent stop for a breakfast that will make you forget your in this hotel. Very french feeling and the best breakfast you'll have.  Very civil un rushed environment and the menu choices are creative and excellently prepared. You'll like this one but it wont be the cheapest breakfast you'll eat but you'll be glad to got out of the hotel environment for this
