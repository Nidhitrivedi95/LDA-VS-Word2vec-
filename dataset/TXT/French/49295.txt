or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA I really like Zinc. The food has been excellent every time I have been here and the service has always been great. This is a great place to go on a Sunday afternoon to sip champagne and people watch. 

The decor is awesome, looks very authentic, and they have a great patio that is perfect when the weather is nice. 

The prices aren't anything out of the norm for this type of restaurant and considering it is in the middle of Kierland, it is fairly unpretentious, something I love about it. 

One thing I have noticed, though, this would not be a vegetarian friendly restaurant. I am a bit of a picky eater when it comes to meat and sometimes I have trouble with the menu. But, that is with all French food, they like their meat. However, the staff has always been very accommodating to my eccentricities:) The onion soup is fabulous, by the way, and my friend loves their mussels, he gets them every time we go.
