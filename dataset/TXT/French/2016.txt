0nddnkjG1RV8hdFdy_wCMA Went in on a friend's recommendation of "best croissant in town", and picked up a pain au chocolat and plain croissant to go.  Like a true North American I ate them while driving.

In a word:  Stale.  

In more words:  Stale, small and expensive, almost $5 for the two.  I should have thought about the fact that there were so many croissants sitting there.

As far as I'm concerned the place should be called "Customer Perdu".

If you want a great croissant always fresh, go to Clafouti on Queen Street West.
