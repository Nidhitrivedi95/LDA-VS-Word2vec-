XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q My husband and I celebrated our anniversary with the sixteen course degustation menu at Joel Robuchon.  Would truly have to describe it as the pinnacle of culinary excellence.  Beautiful setting; knowledgeable, attentive wait staff.  The entire experience from start to finish was beautifully presented and impeccably timed.  One amazingly delicious course and wine pairing after another.  Overall, an incredible experience in so many ways--would highly recommend!
