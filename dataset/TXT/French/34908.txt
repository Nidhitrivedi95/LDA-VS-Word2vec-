HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Had a great lunch at CommeCa. Nice sunlit dining area.  Ask for a table with a view of the Strip. Great French Bistro food. Nothing fancy but tasty good quality food. MOULES FRITES to kill for. Scottish Salmon was well prepared and presented. Other people in the party had a great food too. Service was pleasant and attentive.
Will come back!
