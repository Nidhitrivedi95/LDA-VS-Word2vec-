gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA We recently took a Trip to Vegas for our 2nd Anniversary. After days of combing through reviews of the most romantic restaurants in Vegas we decided to go with this one. The ambiance of this restaurant was quiet, quaint, and the view was beautiful. To start both of the amuse bouches were delicious and had you craving more. I ordered the Lobster and my Husband ordered the bone in New York. The NY was cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth. The lobster was OK. It was very very rich and seemed to be over cooked or maybe just defrosted? It was a little rubbery. After working in fine dining for 8 years where the seafood was flown in fresh, this was just not what I was expecting. For dessert we ordered creme brulee, which was delicious. Since it was our Anniversary they also provided us with a Golden Key, which opened a box at the end of the meal. 

The service was good. We were greeted by name and promptly seated. The server who greeted us, never came back to our table which I thought was a little unusual. The Waiter assistant we had was wonderful. More personable than all of the servers, even engaged us in conversation instead of just talking to us to see if we needed a refill. Also there was a manager walking around who was very attentive, he even got us another glass of champagne when our server had not stopped by. Maybe if we would've spent more, we would've gotten better service like the couples on either side of our table did? (we still spent $300, but for this place we probably didn't spend as much as the other guests) 

All in the food was good and WA was amazing. Even though the prices were high it would've been worth it if the service was better. I will probably not being going back, I would rather chance going to a different restaurant.
