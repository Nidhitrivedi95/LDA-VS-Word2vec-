EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g My wife and I visited Alo for our anniversary and we were beyond happy with our experience.  

The food was impressive in every respect - the presentation was polished and the flavours were bold where needed and subtle where appropriate.  I had the wine pairings (my wife is 7 months pregnant) and they each worked seamlessly with their associated dishes.  

The only thing that might have come close to surpassing the food was the service.  Our main server was warm, friendly and paid us an appropriate amount of attention throughout the meal.  There were a number of other staff who interacted with us at various points through the evening and they were each very efficient at their various tasks and friendly when we chatted with them.  Special shoutout to Quentin (I hope I got his name right) who was very happy to chat about his time in Italy.

Alo is a gem in our midst here in Toronto.  I highly recommend visiting if you are fortunate enough to get a reservation.  We will be returning as soon as circumstances allow.
