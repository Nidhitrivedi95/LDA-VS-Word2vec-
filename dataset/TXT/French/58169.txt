rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A If there is any place in Vegas that we wear out it's Bouchon. The breakfast experience here is the best (as long as there isn't a wait). A French brasserie, Bouchon is an ornate high-ceiling restaurant that brings the feeling of an old cafe in Paris to the strip.

The breakfast menu is simple, but good. Probably the best oatmeal I've ever had. Like other reviews, it's just a good place to start off the day; especially if it's nice enough to sit outside in the courtyard. The pommes frites are a must. Fancy name, but really good fries. And yes...the fries work in the morning fare.

Warning to vegetarians. While I've never had a problem with finding things I like to eat here, they do like to include bacon with and in lots of dishes so watch out. The potato croquettes have bacon in them. Sorry piggies...I didn't know until I swallowed a bite.
