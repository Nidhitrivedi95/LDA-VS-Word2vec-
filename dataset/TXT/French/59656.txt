My family and I have eaten here servers times and we love it! It is a special place to have in Henderson, the employees are so professional and obviously care about their customers and restaurant. We have enjoyed everything we have eaten. The ambience is  for us is quite comforting , usually quiet. The music on Sundays is always great and the singer and guitarist are actually knowledgeable about Bernard (Rest in Peace!) and even if the menu items. Please help support this restaurant so that it doesn't leave and get changed into something that closes down in 6 months such as every other restaurant previously in this location. We don't need another bar, Mexican, Chinese food place. We need to keep Legacy! 
My son have the Scallops and frog legs and loved it and he is 10 years old!
He also loved the coconut sorbet. 
My husband had the salmon Wellington, I had the Filet mignon and we shared the tarte tartan and they were terrific. Most of all though, we love the casual upscale ambience and the excellent caring service from all staff.
