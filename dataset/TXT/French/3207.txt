1Bt7cvkXamVTEZ8Mbjvrow We were seated upstairs and the server provided our menus. The server was helpful in providing explanation about the menu but was all downhill from there.

After ordering, I noticed a couple of elderly ladies that were seated next to us and to my other side another group. The elderly ladies came in and order 10 mins after we gave our order to the server. The other group came almost the same time as the elderly lady but left because they thought the server was taking too long to come back after they asked for another minute (it was another 5-10 mins after and still no one arrived). This was a sign of things to come

The elderly ladies received their food before us. I couldn't believe it. There were only 3 of us vs 2 which couldn't mean it took that much longer. This whole time we were waiting, the server topped up their water and even provided bread. Nothing for us. I had to ask the server for some bread because the food was taking way too long. 

Finally the food arrived. I was looking at how the elderly ladies were served the fries and I couldn't wait. They were filling up the bowls in front of you AND your plate. I was starving. When our steak arrived it looked like any steak but when the server gave us fries, only the bowls in front of us. Again, I couldn't believe it. I looked around other tables and noticed that ALL of them had their plates filled with fries as well. 

I was done with this place. I didn't even think they deserved any tip. I will never go back and DO NOT RECOMMEND. 

FOOD IS AVERAGE AT BEST AND SERVICE IS HORRIFIC. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!
