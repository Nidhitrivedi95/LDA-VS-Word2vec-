4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw When in Vegas, I always frequent Mon Ami!

They never disappoint, they are the most consistent restaurant I've ever been too. I always know I will have a delicious meal, with excellent service and wonderful drinks.

On this trip I enjoyed:

The FRENCH Martini -  Alway memorable and delicious!

The French Onion soup - A great starter before a meal, Hot with melted cheese on toast, floating on  onion broth.

Chicken Liver Mousse Pate -  Always delicious, creamy and texture is smooth

Mussels Mariniere - with its white wine & herbs.... it was perfect for dunking the fresh french baguettes in.

Ground Ahi Tuna Burger - a pleasant burger without the guilt.

I always look forward to dining at Mon Ami! Will definately return and highly recommend!
