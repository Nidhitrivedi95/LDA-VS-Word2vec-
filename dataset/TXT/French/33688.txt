hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Yikes...I feel like a complete odd ball for giving this place anything less than 5 stars like the rest of the Yelp world. Really...I wish Yelp gave 1/2 ratings because it's really a 3 1/2 stars.

NOTE: Baguette Cafe is located in a large business commercial center. It's quiet with lots of tall business buildings everywhere. You may think BC is located at some plaza past this center but no....it's in here!! From reading reviews, I know plenty of Yelpers who have gotten lost or had to circle multiple times around the block to get to this place. 

Service was fantastic and the food was good. Notice I said the word "good" but not "delicious" or "out of this world!" The owner, Oliver, greeted me with a warm welcome. I let him know this was my first time here due to finding this place out through Yelp and he gave me the run-down of the menu. He explained what specials he had for the day, what soups were available, and what are some of the popular items.

I ordered the half soup, half sandwich combo. One of the soups of the day was Potato Leek. It was perfect for the chilly weather. Soup came out pippin hot! I loved it. The sandwich was good but nothing special. I've honestly had better sandwiches at Panera Bread. My meal cost me about $7 and some change. Pretty typical for soup and sandwich combo (just like Panera) but the portions were more on the small side. It BARELY got me full and I normally have a small appetite. So I can't imagine a grown man getting full off of this. Maybe if you order two entrees then yeah.... I really don't get what's the hype about this place. It's simply A-Ok.

Also, there were hardly any seats/tables available inside. So be warn if you're going to dine in during peak hours. There's seating outside but nobody wanted to be out there on such a cold day.
