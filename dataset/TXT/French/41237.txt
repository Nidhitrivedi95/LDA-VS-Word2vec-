kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ I've heard a lot about La Societe but never been there. Today the brunch was great, probebly one of the best in Toronto and of course reasonable price. We almost tried everything on the menu, every part of the food was delicious and great. The warm Scone with cream and jam followed by the short rib and  The frites accompanied by the home made aioli was fabulous.
Ambience and the service was higher than what was expected, so warm, friendly and perfect.
I always think that Life is to short to be waisted so enjoy every each moment of it with your friends and great food.
Good job team La Societe.
