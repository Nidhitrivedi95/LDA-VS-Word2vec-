xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g This is one of those special occasion type restaurants....for me anyways.
It's a pricey restaurant, but in return you get:

1) The best view of the Bellagio fountains and the strip
2) Romantic atmosphere
3) Excellent food and wine
4) Excellent service

If you're with a loved one and celebrating something special, let them know ahead of time to make your visit even more memorable.  The food and the service are top notch.  The service staff are regular everyday folks that serve you without a lot of over-fluffiness!
