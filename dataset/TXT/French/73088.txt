XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Michelin states clearly that it awards its stars based on the FOOD.  For this, I agree that Joel Robuchon deserves 3 stars.  We had the four course menu and everything tasted superb.  

Why the 2 yelp stars then?  Well, yelp describes the ambiance as "romantic, classy, and intimate."  I disagree.  First of all, we (hubby and I) were sat inbetween 2 young couples who were each 1 arm's width away from us.  I was about as close to the two ladies on each side of me as I was to my companion.  You could hear every single word the 4 people around us said, and it was very awkward for all parties.  Definitely not romantic or intimate.  In addition, the restaurant is very bright.  I'm use to a little mood lighting, but this place had the fluorescents way up.  I guess one of the waiters overheard me complaining and said, "The chef likes is bright so you can see the presentation of the food."  Well EXCUSE ME, Chef Robuchon, but I think I would be able to see your food just fine if it were a little more dim and really, I came here to EAT your food, not to SEE you food.

For us, fine dining is just as much about the experience and setting as it is about the food.  Maybe things would have been different if we hadn't been seated next to twenty-somethings celebrating an anniversary and taking pictures of each course and oohh and ahhing loudly next to us.  Don't get me wrong, I think it's sweet, I just don't want to be so close as to be included.

Tips:
- Book the complimentary limo in advance.  We forgot to do so and they didn't have one available for us after dinner.
- Go easy on the breadcart.  Hubby got overzealous and ordered 4 breads and could barely finish his meal.  Sounds like common sense, but hard to resist all those carbs when you're hungry.
- Save a little room at the end for the chocolates, which are delicious.
