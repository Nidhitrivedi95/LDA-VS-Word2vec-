0B_aEPeZjrXs6T7vS3arrA Seems like Political Junkie and I might be of one mind on this place. 

There's food, good food, great food, and good-as-sex food....Sophie's usually produces the latter. One of my top three choices in the Phoenix area. Very reasonably priced for what you get.....similar restaurants in Scottsdale offer half the quality at double the price. 

If a particular server ...that would be 'Jodie', a tall redhead....is available, ask her for her recommendation of the specialty of the day. We've done this twice and have been very impressed....the results have been delicious and memorable. Ordering without guidance, though, can be a bit more hit and miss....we've ended up with some mediocre entrees, a couple times. 

Well worth the time, travel and expense!
