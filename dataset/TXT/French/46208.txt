The burgers were made of high quality meat and perfectly cooked for thick burgers, very juicy... my only complaint was that my patty seemed to be missing some flavour, i couldn't taste any salt whatsoever, it's possible that it was just one of those patty's that missed some of the seasoning, but I'll definitely give it another try just to make sure. If it's the same then we know they don't season their burgers very well, which seems odd considering that they go so far with the excellent high quality toppings and their exquisitely delicious home made brioche bun. 

I also had the Toma award winning poutine too, the gravy was delicious, the fries fresh and perfectly cooked, i found the caramelized onions were tasty, but too sweet for poutine in my opinion at least, the double smoked bacon was a great touch but i couldn't taste or smell any truffle oil as they promised. Next time I'll just have the regular poutine because those curds were super fresh and damn squeaky!! 

I just hope my burger is better seasoned on my second visit.
