_O12nlv3sISPfiNAQVLM4Q I noticed many of the reviews complained about the prices... I stopped by for lunch and had a great meal on the patio/sidewalk... Had the lunch menu, tomato salad and bocconcini to stars followed by the grilled salmon - it was excellent in portion size and taste.  Had a pint and a half of beer to accompany the meal and all was good - this is an "in" spot so you are going to pay more for everything - as long as you know that before you sit down - your good!
