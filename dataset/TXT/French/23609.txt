cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Checked this place out on a business trip last week and was very pleased.  

We started with the cromesquis de fois grau which included two that were a single bite each - considering this, the price seems a little steep however I can assure you they were the best single bite I think I've ever had in my life. Awesome!

We also had some tasty beers and the fish and chips with the duck fat frites - the fish was perfectly cooked and very tender and the fries were great as well.  I can't forget to mention that our server was exceptional and took great care of us also.

Overall a great experience - next time we will definitely have to try more fois!!!
