qauawyA4HmtCIvRG9gk-BA WOW!  This is why Yelp* exists!  Was sitting in my hotel room in Montreal thinking about where to enjoy a Saturday night dinner out on the town and came across Bar & Boeuf on Yelp and made a reservation via Open Table.  Great location and from the moment I walked in the door until I left in a nirvanic haze some three and a half hours later, I was treated like a king!  A very strong wine list coupled with an innovative menu and gorgeous plating made for an unforgettable dining experience.  Listening to other diners around me I feel pretty comfortable in saying that everyone was enjoying their meals as much as I did!  I can without hesitation recommend the Heirloom Tomato/Buffala Mozzarella appetizer and the (now famous) Pig Chuck.    Take a spin on their very informative (and bilingual!) website and look forward to a great evening.
