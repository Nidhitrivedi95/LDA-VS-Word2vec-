qTacF-_Iucc1Nxom_Za_5Q Meh. My second attempt at a Rose joint. Service was quite slow despite being almost 2pm. 

The steak tartare was missing something - capers, I think. The texture was fine. The size of the yolk was too big for the amount of beef there was. Needed one more itsy bitsy tablespoon of meat for the amount of yolkiness.

The country terrine was stiff and not appearing like the pics I've seen online. It was served with 3 small crosscut baguette slices. 3. Not even long diagonal cuts, but 3 almost stale baguette pieces that would be better suited to top a bowl of French onion soup. Even if we cut the terrine into 3 equal ridiculous slabs, they'd still be too big to top the 3 slices of baguette provided. We had to ask for more bread.

We also wanted a sardine tartine, but the power went out so their toaster oven didn't work and according to the waiter, they could do it in a pan but that would " just take forever."  That does not take forever. Making a grilled cheese takes longer than it does to toast 1 slice of bread in a cast iron skillet. Bitch, please. 

We left unsatiated in more ways than one.
