O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Well...at the Palazzo there is nothing cheap. The cheapest food you can eat is at the Grand Lux Cafe, where the food sucks by the way, and the free drinks you get when you sit at a slot machine. So we were in for a little treat when we sat  down at Morel's French Bistro. 
As soon as you get seated the waiters will pamper you. I personally hate that kind of service, but, we were all tired of gambling and a little babying was not too bad. 
We sat down and the waiters do that napkin thing onto your lap. Then several waiters come out to help you pick your wine (which was unneccesary cuz I'll ALWAYS pick the cheapest bottle n e way) and they wait next to you till you make your decision. 
We started with some soup de jour which was some really buttery bacon-ie ham-ie chowder. It was too buttery for me but good.
Then came the mussels for an appetizer which was pretty good.
I chose the seafood fettucine which the sauce tasted like the soup i had and BAD OYSTERS. I couldn't even taste the lobster or the clams. I already had the mussels so basically i had more soup de jour with pasta.
Then my bro's plate came which was the sirloin cooked medium. And my fiance's plate which was the same cooked medium-well. I had a bite of each and they both tasted GREAT. We had the artichoke side which complimented the large portions of meats. 
The meat dishes were very plain (a big piece of meat plotted on a big plate with no decor) but the taste made up for what was missing. For all the money you'll be spending you'd think they'd put a little more on the plates, eh?
So, i learned the next time i go to a steakhouse, STEAK is what i'll order. GEEZ.
The bill came out to about $250-260? and we left a $100 tip (because of the service and it was around Christmas). So it was worth getting pampered for that amount of cash or was it all PRETENTIOUS???
I give it a 3.5
