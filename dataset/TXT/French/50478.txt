OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA I have been looking for a small local spot with good pastries for the occasional snack.  I was surprised to find Honey Cakes because I was expecting only a pastry store.  It turns out to be a great spot for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I had the Honey Burger and a tomato salad.  Fantastic and very reasonable prices especially for the portions you get.  I finished with a pear/almond tart that was amazing.  Worth the stop, even if a bit out of the way.
