rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I knew that the atmosphere would be perfect -- this is Vegas, right? The meal was the thing, and it lived up to the hype. Our waiter was understanding about our dinner companion (who was 45 minutes late) and talked to us about food. When he learned about where I was from, he asked me the best places to eat. Kudos for hiring a foodie as a waitperson, but that's a no-brainer. 

I had the special appetizer -- slow roasted pork belly with pickled vegetables. It'd disgust a vegetarian -- a hunk of pork fat so creamy that it dissolves in your mouth. I also had the roasted short ribs. This dish was incredible until i got to the strange bed of mystery vegetable underneath it. We drank two bottles of wine, Beaujolais.

Also: one of my dinner companions got the flatiron steak with fries. Yes, Tony Bourdain has a reason to get pissed off -- these fries are better than almost any i have ever tasted that were not fried in duck fat. 

I will be back, definitely.
