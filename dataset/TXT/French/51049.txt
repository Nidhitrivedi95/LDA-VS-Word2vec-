P2g6xo5vZSEeGSr9tftLeg A hidden gem in McGill Ghetto neighbourhood. It is a unique tartare restaurant concept, from Salmon, Tuna, Beef, Veal to Scallop and Lobster tartare. You get to choose the weight of the tartare from 100gram to 200 gram and then you get to choose the style from Spicy to Japanese to Russian style.  I thought the concept is very interesting and I love it! 
Other than tartare, they have a vast variety of appetisers, main courses which have a Asian fusion approach I mean you can get Grilled Hamachi Collar?!!
Oh almost forget they hv a raw bar too, oysters, prawn cocktail u name it. 
Now this happen in this little restaurant, I think it's amazing. 
Service was great, very friendly, the ambiance was happening and high energy. 
Will definitely be back.
