yAkT-tNGut0rbWlA7kjrdg I visited this lovely little macaroon shop not so long ago. Normally I do not eat Macaroons, but I started to treat myself to a bit of heavenly tasty pleasure, one Pistachio, Salt-Caramel and Hazelnut with the dangerous Hot Chocolate as an accomplice. 
Its a very small plainly decorated coffee shop in the midth of Stockbridge. After an enjoyable delight it was easy to browse the charity shops in the area.
There is no doubt that the macaroons are delicious and of good quality. However, they are not the cheapest. The staff is friendly enough.
Besides the macaroons I did not see many other delightful cake choices.
Would I go back for a coffee and Macaroons. Yes, definitely.
