COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw Enjoyed all aspects of this dining experience; variety, presentation, taste and quantity were all very good.  Dover Sole was cooked to perfection, the duck wasn't enjoyable.  Our party was impressed with the service, the quietness and overall design of the environment, we received prompt and attentive service without feeling we were rushed.  The prix fixed menu offered an interesting array of flavors.  A very enjoyable night out, I would suggest dressing up as if this was going to be a memorable event.
