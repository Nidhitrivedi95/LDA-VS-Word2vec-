U1LB3sRMGTu_h7Sf9QdNoA My fav cafe in Toronto!

I love this place because:
1. Food - their crepes are to die for - I just couldn't have enough of them (and I've had crepe in Paris too)
2. Dessert - just amazing!
3. Ambiance - As french as it could get

Scope for improvement
1. Variety (well that's optional - I still love them)
2. Price - it's a bit pricey - but well deserved :)
