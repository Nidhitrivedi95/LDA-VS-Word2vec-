- I always get a benedict or poached egg dish for breakfast, brunch here was no different. The eggs were poached perfectly just the way I like them. 
- They don't use hollandaise sauce on the benedict, which I would have preferred, but their sauce was also nice and creamy, but not the taste I'm used to. 
- A side of fruit and potatoes are included - but not much as the benedicts are pretty heavy in themselves. The potatoes are cooked in duck fat and taste divine. 
- The benedict comes with a fresh glass of OJ, I LOVE FRESHLY SQUEEZED OJ!!
- Latte was good

Service
- The service was great from beginning to end
- The waiters were very busy, but came by to check on us at all the right times. We never felt rushed.
- The waiters made sure food and drinks came to use in a timely manner after we ordered.
