xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g This is my very first Yelp review but the experience my wife and I had, for our 30th anniversary, at the Eiffel tower restaurant was so exceptional, I feel a need to share. The reviewer from 8/23/2011 hit the nail on the head. The food was exceptional but the service we received from the entire staff, and David in particular, rated 6 stars out of 5. Expensive? Yes, but worth every penny and then some. This is the BEST view of the Bellagio fountains.
