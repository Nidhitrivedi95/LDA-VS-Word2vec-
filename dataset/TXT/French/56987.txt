rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Finally made it for dinner.  Thomas Keller fans rejoice.  Arrived around 9:30 pm, no wait at all.  Front of house staff were awesome, made us feel welcome like you were guests at someone's home.  Service was flawless.  Love the bread on the table.  Like right on the table  Salmon fans, try the Salmon rillette.  Amazing.  So good, my wife and I had to take our mothers the next night.  Also tried the Lamb, Sole, Steak Frites.  All good, but they had trouble cooking my steak at medium rare.  But because of the overall service and quality of food it is still a 5.  Will definitely be back.  Dont miss it!!
