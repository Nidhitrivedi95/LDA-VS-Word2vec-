nKeGPmH5dYNVL5AyAItuKg love this place! went here once on a tuesday for their specials on oysters (buck a shuck) and house wine (buck an oz). everything was so delicious; although the portions could be a tad bigger. there were 4 of us and we ended up sharing eveything and in the end, we only paid 25$/each for 4 dozens of oysters, steak tartare, snails, and 12oz steak & marrow. great atmosphere!
