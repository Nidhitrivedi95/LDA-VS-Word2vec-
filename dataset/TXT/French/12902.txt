4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Second time at Mon Ami Gabi and it was just as good as the first.  Steaks and sauces were as delicious as we remembered and those in our party who ordered something different (crepes and quiche) were just as happy with their meals. Prices, great service, and view of the Bellagio water feature are all added pluses.  Make reservations ahead of time (we did), the restaurant has been packed both times we were here.
