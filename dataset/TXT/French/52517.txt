q0n4I-zqiI47xispOqc1lA This is my favorite casual brunch spot in the Burgh!

The waitstaff is friendly and knowledgable of the menu and they have a vast selection of savory and sweet brunch plates to choose from.  I've had the brie and apple crepe and the berries and cream french toast and have enjoyed both thoroughly (although I prefer the berries and cream french toast since the portion is a bit bigger).
