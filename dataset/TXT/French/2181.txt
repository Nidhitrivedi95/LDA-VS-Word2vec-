But there's something a little tired about Picasso's PRIX FIXE menu concept.  They have 2 versions, basically either a 3 or 4 course set menu.  You have choices within the menu itself.  And you can "upgrade" certain appetizers or entrees to like lobster or wagyu.  I dunno, seemed kind of tacky to me.  You're already paying at minimum a couple hundred dollars--no need to upsell for another $100 or more.  Just make it a whole different menu selection.

So, we were a group of four, and we all ordered the 4-course set menu.  We all got the foie gras.  It was good.  Not like what you get in France, but tasty enough.  And there was a soup--don't recall exactly what it was.  For the entree, two of us ordered the lamb.  Smallish serving, but ok.  The other two ordered the halibut (what was printed on the menu), but when the actual plate came out, the waiter said that it was sea bass.  And it looked and tasted like sea bass as well.  Not exactly a complaint, but a place like Picasso should run a tighter ship.  You should know your ingredient inventory and print your menus accordingly.  All in all, it just detracted from the whole experience.
