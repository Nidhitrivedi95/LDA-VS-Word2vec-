sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g Went here for a restaurant Week and it was a pleasant surprise. I never even knew he restaurant was there because it is in corporate building. The food was great. We had the shrimp ooh la la which was excellent and the NY strip. The chef came out and greeted us which was nice. I would definitely go back
