D87tFO-R6U8f4-e0r4Zq_g Horrible place. Ordered two crepes one with goat cheese and basil, and one with strawberries and lemon churd came out to 20.25 I don't know how because the menu prices should've came out to be about 18 and change. Crepe with goat cheese had minimal amount of filling almost the entire crepe was just dough with nothing inside. The strawberry crepe had like two strawberries in it for a crepe thats almost ten bucks. Both of them where dry and for some reason I got nasty attitudes from both the girls working there. 
Much better crepe places in Toronto then this one don't bother.
