UFtVchZr4uRl8TtTe9WxZw When you enter this cafe you are overcome by the most fantastic smell of cooking crepe batter. The set up is cozy and relaxed which is nice with all the bustle on Saint Denis. As soon as the door closed it seemed like the noise on the street just melted away.

We entered right after dinner for some desert crepes. I ordered a raspberry/banana/chocolate which was the size of a dinner plate and perfect amount of tart cooked raspberry mixed with sweet banana/chocolate. My boyfriend ordered the lemon crepe which tasted fantastic as well. 

The staff had some trouble speaking English but there is an English and a French menu so you can always just point at what you want. I didn't find this to be a huge issue and the staff was so friendly and accommodating that it made the language barrier a non-issue.

With the addition of a pint of beer the meal came out to about 20 CAD which I would gladly pay again for the fantastic crepe and lovely dining experience.
