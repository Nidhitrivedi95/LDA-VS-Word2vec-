jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg Has huge potential.  I ordered the quinoa and kale salad with chicken breast.  I asked for it with dressing on the side, they forgot but quickly brought a new one out and it looked attractive. The salad was missing the almonds as describe in the menu, and there were dried cranberries added that weren't on the menu. The two huge balls of goat cheese was just too much, it was warm and hard to break up any because it was so gooey I couldn't eat it.  The chicken was super dry and seemed like it was reheated in the microwave for too long.  My friend got the Cabernet Burger with fries.  The fries were really good, as was the hamburger.  He also ordered the bread pudding (I didn't try it). It was attractive on the dish and he said it was an A+. The waitress was nice, and attentive. The odd thing that bugged me ( I Am a little OCD) was there were tables that needed to be wiped off the entire time we were eating.  There was also paper napkins under the table that should have been picked up. There were only 2 other customers there so not busy.  No one wants to sit to have a nice lunch and look at dirty tables.  But, I would go back and give it another shot.
