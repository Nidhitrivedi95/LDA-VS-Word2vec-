UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw Restaurant is surprisingly huge for a downtown location, we ordered a bunch of things to share. Their roasted duck poutine and ginger-chili fried frog's leg was great as a shared appetizer. To their "large" plate, we ordered the drunken tuna, lamb 2 ways and their veal meatball "tomahawk". The tomahawk was one of the most delicious meatball I ever have. Wish I didn't have to share with anyone. We finish the dinner off with a passion fruit souffle, and again, wish I didn't have to share that either.
