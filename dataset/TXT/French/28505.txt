ehRigNzlkRQlvhzKr7PLCQ I admire what they are doing as  a company, with that written, their food is horrible. Yes their prices are great,  but even for that amount of money, I expect better than subpar food. It shows in the ingredients. You also have to flag down the waiters/waitresses before they even acknowledge you when you come in for take out because they are all hanging out at the bar talking to each other. I finally got the attention of a chef before he ran into the back room by yelling at him and he reluctantly took my order. I have had six dinners here so far hoping that everyone would be better than the last, I have been sadly disappointed every single time. I guess this location really is cursed.
P.S. The food at the last named location at this place was absolutely wonderful, sad they couldn't keep on going with the CB's Legacy.
