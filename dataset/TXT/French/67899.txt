V0iYi5OjdRcz82m95jV7vQ Stopped by this new French bakery when it caught my eye coming out of the cleaners next door. Bought a baguette and some tiramisu, the baguette was by far the better of the two, it had that nice crisp but chewy texture that I look for. The tiramisu however was very disappointing, it had little coffee flavor and was much to thick. I get that tiramisu is an Italian specialty but feel that if they are going to offer it they need to reevaluate their recipe. Will stop by again but stick to more traditional French offerings.
