I had high expectations coming in, and every one of them was met!
* service - top notch!
* Atmosphere - great!
* Food - to die for!
I made reservations (because calling an hour beforehand just didn't work - they were fully booked) and came with my family. Throughout the meal, the service was fantastic and very attentive. Every unused dish was picked up swiftly, the empty bread baskets were quickly replaced with full ones. The only time they forgot something was when asked for Parmesan for the pasta dish - my partner had to ask twice. Also, this pasta dish was the only vegetarian main on the menu, and was just OK according to her. This is not a good place for vegetarians - but the rest of us had the best meal ever:
We started with bone marrow (Yammi! cooked just right) and then moved to the chicken pate (good). These are very good dishes to split three-way (you get three bones).  For the mains we had the veal kidney in mustard sauce (fantastic, rich meat flavours), the hunger steak with fries (as expected, simple but good steak and good fries), and the shrimp risotto (yammi!). 
For dessert we shared the signature desert (ill folttante with caramel) - this one looks great and it's an instagrammer's dream. it's fine for the pallet as well. However, the surprise desert of the evening was the coffee cream brule - well executed classic french with a twist. We let our waiter know how much we liked it and he told us that he agrees that it is great, but they change the flavour every two weeks. Last week's tea flavour was not as good in his opinion... 
To sum up - very nice evening. Book ahead.
