xeFVRUjxorxjO_qjX8FNdw Always a great food experience.  Family has been coming here for dinner, special occasions and lunches for years.  Food is amazing and prices are very reasonable for the quality.  A true gem in a land filled with chain restaurants.   The decor perhaps needs updating and the service can be a bit slow at times but always very friendly.  Definitely try this place out!
