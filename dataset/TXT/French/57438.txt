rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Yum. I think I just became a fan of French cuisine. A friend of mine loves this place and wanted to come here while we were in town. If she hadn't recommended this place, I probably wouldn't have known about it since it's tucked away on the second floor of the Venetian near the wedding chapels. For a secluded place, it can get pretty busy but we were lucky to have only waited about 15 minutes for our party of 7 for a Saturday brunch.

The restaurant definitely had an elegant air to it and I was glad I was dressed up for the occasion. In fact, the waiter addressed me as madam and was attentive to our needs and came back every so often to refill my friend's coffee. I decided to get one of the specials of the day and although the name escapes my memory (it had Oeuf in it), the dish still lingers in my mouth. It consisted of some cheese and creamy potatoes and was nice and warm. It was definitely worth the splurge of $26. Thomas Keller, you just earned yourself a fan!
