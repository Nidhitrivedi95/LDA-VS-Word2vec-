Xw50tINqzrI_BM_x7_IcZA I ordered one brie cheese crepe with strawberry jam that was so delicious, fluffy and warm - it was a rainy day and the meal was perfect to lighten the mood a little bit! Service greeted me in French and was super friendly and attentive all the time.

The place is super nice, elegant and cozy, the only thing I can say is that the seats are a little bit uncomfortable for me - my back was destroyed after eating my crepe and drinking my tea but overall it was a good experience.
