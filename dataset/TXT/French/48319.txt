O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg Came here with a groupon deal ($70 for a 3 course meal for 2) and had an overall amazing experience.

We requested a more private table which they kindly accommodated, and our server Michael provided us with the best service I have had in a very very long time. 

The meal itself was great (minus the lobster bites in the apps - those were just ok).

The pork belly app was tasty, the steak main was huge and cooked to perfection and served on delicious creamed kale, and the shrimp pasta (with dill and cream sauce) was amazing.

Had the beignets and chocolate mousse for dessert (licked plate for both of these) and also grabbed a bottle of the red wine that came with the tasting menu (only $40! and delicioussss).

The sign of a great experience: We ended up staying there for 3.5 hours without realizing how much time had gone by and without feeling rushed, or like we were always waiting for our food or service. Would definitely recommend.
