BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag Love this place. Food is amazing. Service is great. So glad to have another great place in Grayhawk.  I love that the sandwiches are served on a cutting board..something unique, and fun.  I ordered take-out one day, I was expecting the normal "take out" type presentation.  Cold food, warm salad...you know.  I was blown away!!  I opened my food, and aside from the cutting board, I felt like I had been served in the restaurant.  I have not had anything there that I wouldn't order again...wonderful food, great service...all around great!!  One of my new favorites!
