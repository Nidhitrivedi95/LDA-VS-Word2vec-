Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA I like this place...  

As everyone pretty much knows Brasserie V fills up quick!  Its very small and the atmosphere is very cozy (unless you get sat at the table by the door in winter).  Come early to experience the beer and wine selection well waiting for your table! 

Every time I go here I get the Frites.  Ahhh yum I can taste the dipping sauces right now. Don't let them skip out on serving you bread because you ordered an appetizer.  The butter for the bread (or in my case frites) is too good to miss. 

I love their duck entrees and I usually get that every time I go.  Its nice that they switch up the menu but I really enjoyed the duck leg served over greens vs the new casserole duck entree.  Its still very good though! Just don't burn your tongue! 

Service overall was good.  The hostess was super friendly and helpful.  We actually sat at the bar to eat instead of waiting for a table. Best thing is since you are at the bar your bartender/server is always right there on top of everything.  Eating at the bar, I think you get faster friendlier, service. Plus you can figure out what your favorite new Belgian beer is. 

* * If you like the beer selection here I would recommend trying out the Malt House on E. Wash.  But don't go the the Malt House hungry...  they don't serve food.
