rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w my bf and i came here on our first night in vegas. i was pretty excited because we never have time to actually sit down and eat at a nice restaurant when we're there. the service was pretty good by the other waiters, but our main waiter was rude.. and i thought he was like this to everyone but he wasn't. he did not thoroughly explain the menu to us, but he did to the couple next to us, and everything was really brief with him. hey we're paying $300 for this experience, better treat everyone equally. maybe its cause we're younger? i don't know. 

the food was alright... the beef tenderloin was really tasteless and dry.. maybe it just wasn't their night since another table complained about something being dry also.
