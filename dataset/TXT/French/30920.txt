The outside of the grocery may not look like much, but the decor and the service makes you feel welcome once you enter. You basically order your food or drink at the service counter and find a table to sit at and eat. They have a couple of huge deli cases full of pastas, meats, cheeses and desserts. They also have an enormous collection of French wines that are displayed beautifully throughout the store. I haven't had the opportunity to grab lunch here yet, but the BBQ shrimp po-boy and muffuletta sandwiches look amazing. The cochon de lait sandwich is also on my need-to-order list. I came in for some beignets and coffee one day and took home some yummy macarons for dessert later. They have quite a variety of macarons to choose from. My personal favorite is the salted caramel one. I also took home some of their homemade cinnamon almond butter and was eating that every morning on my toast. This place has been a nice addition to the Phoenix area and gives me some good throwback memories of my visit to New Orleans.
