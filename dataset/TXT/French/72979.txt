XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q I have been wanting to try this place for a while so when I went for the Restaurant Show I made a reservation.  This place is a foodie's dream.  If you are not into fine dining and French food please DO NOT spend your money here because you will be GREATLY disappointed. 

I spent North of $1000 for the 16 course tasting menu for 2 people with 1 alcoholic drink.  I don't know what I was thinking but that is a lot of food.  I was getting full half way through the tasting menu.  The bread cart was awesome but it is a filler so don't load up on it too much because you won't have room for the other dishes.

The menu changes slightly during the year but overall the food is good.  This is one of those places you have to experience if you can afford it.  It is not just about the food it is a complete dining experience for your senses.  The way it is presented, tastes, smells, the textures of each element on the plate in your mouth.  

The plating was borderline over the top.  The funny thing is some of the non-edible elements on the plates are glued on which is kind of ghetto in my book for a place like this.  

This is definetely a place for you and your honey to get dolled up and spend several hours in a very nonrushed atmosphere and just soak in the experience.  Afterwards you can walk out and try to win the money you spent at this place at the tables.  Good Luck!

Oh, before you leave ask them for a copy of the menu which they will gladly provide with the date and your name on it.  It makes for a nice keepsake.  I'm planning on framing it with my receipt.
