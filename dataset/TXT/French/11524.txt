4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Arrived here on a Friday evening around 630pm. No lines if we ate inside. There was a 15 min wait if we wanted to sit on the patio. 


Food here is a decent price. $29 or so for the cheaper end steaks. 

I was overly intoxicated when I ate here for dinner so this review might not mean as much since my taste buds weren't at 100%

Anyway I ordered the steak with the blue cheese I believe. 

Eh honestly, everything in Vegas is expensive. It came with fries. Nothing really special. Steak wasn't super juicy and wasn't very tender. More tough from what I can remember. 

In any case, if I'm nearby Paris hotel and want food without waiting in a long line, id totally come back.
