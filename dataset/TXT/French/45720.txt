mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q By far my favorite restaurant in the world. This location and the Paris location are 5star. 

The food is perfection every single time. Close your eyes and order. Foodie heaven. Foie gras, lobster pasta, uni pasta, caviar with yellowtail, crab truffle salad, everything is unbelievable. 

Sit at the round bar and watch them work it's beautiful like they are making art. 

Their wine is the best.

Make a reso.

Dress nice.

And bring a lot of money.
