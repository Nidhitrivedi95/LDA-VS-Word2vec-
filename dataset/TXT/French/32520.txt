gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg Wow, in contrast to all the great restaurants and pubs in Montreal, this was the pits.  Service was very efficient, until we finished our meal and our waitress disappeared for the next 20 minutes.  The blonde beer was horrible, almost a sweet and sour taste at the same time.  My wife and I challenged each other to take a swig without wincing and we couldn't pull it off.  I have tried many beers and enjoy microbrews but this was horrible.  Then we noticed a waitress taking the dirty silverware that was collected from the tables, putting them in a pitcher which I assume was slightly soapy water, wiping them off with a towel and putting them back in a tray as clean.  This was not in the kitchen, but on a side table and no rinsing.  The music from the pop videos was so loud, you had to shout to have a conversation, and it was all rap and pop crap.  Overall a really bad experience.  If you want a good pub, try Ye Olde Orchard Pub, great food and service and good selection of beers, both Irish and local.
