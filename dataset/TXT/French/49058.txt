OmFXBWLv1DoFelP2-RLqFA Went there for my boyfriends birthday as a large group! It was nice we had our own spot upstairs- a lot of food but you need to like a large arrangement of different foods to enjoy this place. It was not what my taste buds like but the group in general REALLY liked it. Not a cheap place- prepare yourself for a bill.
