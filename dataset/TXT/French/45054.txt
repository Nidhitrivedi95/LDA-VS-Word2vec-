mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q I went here with a friend a little while ago and got the seasonal discovery tasting menu. The restaurant, as its name describes, feels like an elegant food workshop. You get to see the chefs prepare the dishes right before your eyes. We chose the bar seating to get to experience this. We wore suits, but you could definitely get by in just a dress shirt and pants, probably should avoid jeans though.

The only disappointing part of the experience was at the start when we had the bread. After hearing so much about the decadent bread cart offered next door and how some of that same bread was offered here, I expected a lot. However, the bread was pretty hard and nothing special.

After that, the rest of the experience was a wonderful culinary journey. Nine courses in all, none disappointing in the slightest. Some highlights include the delicate yet perfectly seasoned sea scallops, the langoustines with a spectacular green curry sauce, a unique white onion tart, a delectable serving of lightly smoked salmon, luscious foie gras stuffed quail, and Joël Robuchon's famous mashed potatoes. The desserts were exotic and delicious, and it all finished off with one of the better cups of coffee I have had.

The meal was a bit pricy for one michelin star, costing around $220 after tip (with no alcohol), but considering the quality of the food and the price of a likely similar meal next door, it was definitely worth it.
