XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q The food, decor and the service were absolutely great! Their bread cart and the sweet treat cart were great additions to an amazing experience. I didn't try the 16 course because I didn't want to miss out on the carts. The langoustine ravioli and the caviar were the my two most favorite dishes. And if you are a foi gras fan, you must try theirs!
