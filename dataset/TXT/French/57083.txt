rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I had dinner here and it's simply amazing. From the decor, the baked goods, down to the service, everything was very well put together. It's a really fancy place, so I suggest dressing up would be appropriate.

Their most popular dish here was the porkchops, so I ordered that. It was super tender, moist, and very flavorful! Came with brussel sprouts and poached pears. yummy.

Their mango sorbet was also very good. They give you 2 scoops of it as a dessert entree. The price is very reasonable, and if you're with good company, this will be an overall great experience!
