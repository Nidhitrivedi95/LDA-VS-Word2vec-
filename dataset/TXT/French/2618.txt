0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Time-machine dining for all your favorite Americanized-French dishes, preparations and flavors from the early 90's. "Traditional" French food supported by a five-star front of house team. 

++ solid 5-star service from our captain and his team. Very well done.
A 10-top table is a marathon and a beast! Awesome work!

EXCELLENCE IN SERVICE
Sadly, this style of service and elegance is very rare to find in these days of 2017. 
Maitre'D and supporting hosts, Sommelier and wine stewards, Captain (and a true one at that), under-waiters, runners, waterers, bread men, busers. 
Making out this list I guess it is not too far from staffing in many other places, but so rare to find the *coordination*, the elaborate communication, the attention to detail and timings to the second. 
It makes all the difference in the world, although if they're doing it right, you don't even notice: by the end of your meal, you are just sitting gracefully in bliss as the flavors continue to titillate the palate. At Picasso you are also looking out at the Bellagio pool and enjoying the water show.  

# I wouldn't be mickobizzle if I didn't find something to improve on:
## runners *always* messed up the plate for our vegetarian diner, always giving him he wrong plate. It was like they were picking on him, mocking him for refusing to rip the flesh of each dish's beast, so blatantly brandished in his face!

WINE LIST OF THE AGES
You might expect (and I *do*) a wine list of "death" that would crush the cellars of most of the world's restaurants, especially here in Vegas. Picasso doesn't disappoint. 
For me tonight we had bottles of:
+ the tip-top bottle (and so glad to show my colors of favoritism) in Maison Tattainger's finest preparation, the Comtes De Champagne, this one from 2006. 
+ big bad bold bruisy Heitz Cabernet from 2011. 
Yeah I know it's a bit boring and standard, but I know none of these folks have had it, so there. 
+ a sweet and pure, fresh and creamy, silky Montbazzilac 
with our desserts. (Should have ordered it for that monster-sized fois gras)

ART OF THE AGES
Well, it is called Picasso so you might imagine that being Caesars they would have multiple largest-format-he-painted original oils throughout the dining room. Multiple tens of millions. Magnificent.  

BUT IVE MOVED ON!! THIS FOOD IS ALSO FROM ANOTHER ERA. 
I no longer crave the heart-stopping all-butter-and-cream recipes of those days (early '90's) and certainly not in *every* one of the nine courses!
* delightful pheasant croquette amuse bouche filled with cream sauce and accompanied by a side shot glass of savory and creamy cream. 
* lobster salad. Wow what a portion! Piles and piles of delicious, luscious, rich lobster meat!
(For some that could have been a meal, but we are just getting started!)
* scallop with mashed potatoes and a rich meaty (beef stock?!!?) gravy, garnished with truffle shavings (xomg riicchh!) for a $supplement
(Dude I'm full.)
# sauté of fois gras. Not one but *two* ginormous pieces of the world's most decadent meat. Preparation was warm sear on the outside and cold-like-butter inside. Not for me. I like it one way or the other. And I wanted it to be seared to the point of almost melting. 
* three giant lamb medallions. Perfectly cooked and drizzled with a delightful lamb aioli. Best sauce of the night. Garnish was a miss. Breaded and fried lettuce, tomato and stewy veg. 
* petit fours trays of awesome meringues, apricot gummies, orange cheesecakes, chocolate truffles and fondants. Woaw!
* fine coffee!  woaw!
* pineapple tart. pink-cotton-candy ice cream, quenelles of raspberry ice cream, vanilla tapioca atop a delicious pineapple layered pastry. Luscious!
* digestif of Cointreau, neat. 

A fantastic tasting menu if you have never enjoyed this style of food properly (or if you were too young). 
A museum of fine art and fine cuisine!
