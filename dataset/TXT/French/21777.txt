Bf-yMQiSmDZyqfGyFKQ0bA Went here because I had a coupon, well just like Jocelyn this might be my new hang out place! Loved that they made their own alcohal and when we got the bill I loved it even more!!!!!! The food was good  too, though with them having a chef that isnt a surpise! The location is awesome with being so close to the Waterfront but not having to have such a pricey meal! Definetly I will be back and will be bringing friends too!
