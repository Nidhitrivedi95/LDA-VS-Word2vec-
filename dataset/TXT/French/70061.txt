wuuJhxMDAj5gGVdvobGHJg There's something so refreshing about really really delicious, good quality food that is devoid of any kind of pretension. 

My love affair with this restaurant began when they let me ramble on in French to them as I made the reservation and continued when we sat down at the bar and all of the servers plus the owner chatted throughout our meal with us. They gave us great suggestions for wines to go with our incredible food and, when we had eaten more than we could handle, we were offered a delicious digestif.

The ambience was laid back and excellent. The servers were great, the food was unparalleled and I don't ever want to come back to Montreal without eating here!
