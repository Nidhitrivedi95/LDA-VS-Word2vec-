Great things: tasty cocktails, delicious food (making the long waits worth it :)

I had a grapefruit mimosa and iced Bailey's latte and both were phenomenal.  I wasn't overly hungry so ordered the yogurt and granola bowl that turned out to be massive and loaded with deliciousness (all kinds of fruit, nuts, homemade granola, mmmm). My friend had what I believe was a meatloaf sandwich with greens on the side and she was very pleased (plus the sandwich was big enough she took half home for dinner). We both bought treats from the bakery to take home as well - I got a creme brulee tart and an apriocot pastry.  Both were amazing, but the creme brulee tart was out of the world - highly, highly reccomend it!

Only reason I've given it four stars is I had ordered a royale brioche to split with my friend during our meal and wasn't informed until well after our food came that they had run out - would have been nice to know this at some point during the 30-40 or so minute wait for our food that it wasn't available so I could have looked at the menu again to see if there was something else we could try.  By the time they told me it seemed pointless to try to order something else.  Nonetheless, I'd love to go back and sit on the patio.
