VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ First time here...have passed this place many times and it is not hard to find, but it is located in a place that you can easily drive past and miss.   We decided based on Yelp reviews to try this place as we wanted something different.  

We started with a beet salad which was not bad, the portion was good for two people to share and it was very tasty.  We had the salmon and the Ribeye as these are dishes we like to try for comparison, the portion of the salmon was ok, it was not the biggest I have seen but also not the smallest, it was average.  The Ribeye was good but the piece did have a lot of fat so you were looking for the meat.  For the price it is very very close to almost not being worth it because the steak is not that thick and like I said, there was a lot of fat on it and it not the kind of fat that you can eat.

It was cooked well and we enjoyed our experience.  There is music there almost every night so the staff and ambiance were above the top.  It definitely made up for the food and I am not talking about the taste, I am talking about the fine line of price versus quantity.  

This is a place I would recommend for everyone to try at least once and leave your review on your experience.  Because of the selection of items on the menu, we will go  back again and bring some other folks with us so I can get their opinion and input on the food.

Again, quality was AWESOME, quantity was riding the line as far as portion but overall it was good.

I will see how this next visit goes and update, but I do recommend you try this place at least once.
