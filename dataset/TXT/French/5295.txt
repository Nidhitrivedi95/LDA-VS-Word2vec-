3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw I dislike Mimi's Cafe.  I always have.  I decided that, after a few years of avoidance that they would improve.  I was dead wrong.  Mimi's is still meh.  I had breakfast there with my mother while my father was in surgery down the street.  I ordered croissants, which were delicious, but the actual meal of potatoes, bacon, and eggs was horrid.  It was chewy bacon with bland eggs and oily potatoes. 

Ew.

Sorry, but I dislike Mimi's for many reasons, all of which relate to their food and sad service.
