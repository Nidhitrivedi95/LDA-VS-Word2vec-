mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Great restaurant and great price. You don't have to pay too much but get the same quality of food and service as Robuchon.

If you go there by 6:30pm, you get a full course meal as $49.(First time I ordered that but this time we went there a bit late)

Because I didn't give them 5 stars, they took waaaaaaay too long between 2 appetizers and main dish. We had to ask for it.
