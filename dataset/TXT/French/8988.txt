4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I sort of hate to admit that one of my absolute favorite places to eat in Vegas and someplace we eat at at least once or twice each trip is a hotel restaurant, but the food is just plain awesome!  Breakfast s great and the people watching, if you sit outside, is the best show in town. What can be more fun than eggs at 7:30 am while watching the wrecked people stumble by that haven't been to bed yet.
