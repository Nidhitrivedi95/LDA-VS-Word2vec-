Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA This review is for the night club/ lounge.

I've DJ'ed all over the world in dozens of clubs. And I've been in Vegas for about 5. So I decided to check out Mix for my first time. Expecting it to be like Foundation Room, it was anything but! 

Spectacular view of the strip and what's best about it is unlike any other venue I've seen at high altitude in Vegas, you get a great view indoors thanks to the window pane which extends the entire wall facing the strip. This is great for those nights when the weather isn't so good. You can also stand out in the balcony if you like as well. 

The vibe inside was great, a little bit of an older crowd, I'd definitely recommend  this place to those in their 30's and up. DJ did a great job in playing music for the crowd. 

My only complaint was service was a little slow at the bar despite the fact that their wasn't a line. But the staff at the door was awesome and the GM was very hospitable. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a hidden gem in Vegas!
