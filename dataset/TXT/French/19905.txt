aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw If you are a fan of pastries, then you have to visit Bouchon.  Though it doesn't look like much when you walk past it, this place has some amazing baked goods.  I highly recommend the financiers (think madeleine, only better) and the chocolate croissants.  The croissant was buttery and flaky, yet not heavy at all.  They also weren't skimpy on the chocolate so that's a major plus.   And don't hesitate to get a cup of espresso or latte here either.  It is definitely worth it and much better than that bitter Starbuck's junk.
