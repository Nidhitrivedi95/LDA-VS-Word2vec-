s-zwyD8YOm-y3AbRrsRx7w Wasn't impressed. Cheese fondue comes with bread with no sides. The portion is small and the quality is poor. The tip is enforced and the service does not live up to the price. Not the same place / experience as I've remembered. it's true that human has terrible memories. Don't make my mistake and avoid this resto at all cost.
