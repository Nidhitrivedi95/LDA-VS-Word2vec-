X8Fd5t3l8ksyacTQDKsUPw I attended the Favourites menu for the final week of the Feasting Room at the Orbit Room.  This was my first time eating there and I was very disappointed by the food.  I was hoping that with the menu being the "Favourites" menu it would be the greatest items off their different animal menus.  If these were the best items they need to do alot of work before opening up as a new venture.

Way too many good restos in toronto to spend $65 on bad food.
