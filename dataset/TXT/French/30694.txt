FVY75lAgzS4BKFPnZ8oHeA I had the 8oz rib steak. It was served up with a béarnaise sauce, steak fries and market vegetables. It was perfectly pink and tender, well rested and exactly how I ordered it. Only complaint was that they missed the rubbery connective tissue in the butchering, I remained calm as I pulled what seemed like dental floss out of my steak.
