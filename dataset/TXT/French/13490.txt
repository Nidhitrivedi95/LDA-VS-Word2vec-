4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw One of the best steaks I've ever had. The bone-in ribeye was cooked perfectly. Even their bread & carrots were super delicious. My wife really enjoyed her salad as well, as she isn't a steak eater. Our table couldn't have been in a better spot. Great view of the fountain/water at the Bellagio & perfect breeze, even though we were seated indoors. Now that I know that there's two locations about 30-45 min from me, I'll have to try each of them to see how they stack up.
