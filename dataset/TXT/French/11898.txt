4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We come here every time we're in Vegas which is like 6 times a year and this is by far the worst time here! We usually always get the Croque Monsieur and this time it was bad. The server was not good at all he did nothing to make our visit good! I complained about my food and proceeded to argue with me. Also I ordered and blueberry and elderflower martinis which used to be on the menu it wasn't good. Very disappointed I'm not sure if we will come back based on the last visit!
