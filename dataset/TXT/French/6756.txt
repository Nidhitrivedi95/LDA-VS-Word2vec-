4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Shame on me for ordering such a mundane thing as a burger at this place.   But the gruyere cheese got my interest and I wanted their fries.  I specifically asked for a medium rare burger and what I got, of course, was a well done burger with literally a paper thin slice of cheese.  It was $13 and did come with their fantastic fries.  The burger was not made on the premises and was in fact pre-formed.  That's ridiculous.

I waited at least 15 minutes for the replacement.  There was no offer to take it off the bill..I took it off the bill myself.  Horrible on-site floor managers.  They could care less about your dining experience.  I wrote to the corporate offices of Lettuce Entertain You.  They never wrote back.

Beautiful looking restaurant.  Good luck and I hope you have a better dining experience than I had.  There are too many other more worthy places to eat IMHO.  Go to Spago where I have been many times over the years and NEVER had a bad meal there.
