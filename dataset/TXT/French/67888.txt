V0iYi5OjdRcz82m95jV7vQ This is absolutely the best bakery in all of Charlotte. The chef is a French master who moved to Charlotte after owning and running a restaurant in LA (and was also private Chef to Michael Jackson's family and has cooked for Oprah). Highly recommend the chocolate domes (bottom layer is a brownie, topped with a chocolate mousse dome and covered in a chocolate shell), the cannelés (traditional french custardy pastry that they make perfectly), macarons, opera cake, and the tiramisu!
