0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Probably one of the best meals I have ever had. I went with my brother and husband to celebrate our weekend in Vegas. 

The artwork was fantastic, our waiter was incredibly attentive and the food was amazing. I enjoyed course after course. The red pepper soup was great. The little gift boxes with cookies was a wonderful touch. 

I really enjoyed being surrounded by real Picasso paintings during our meal.  I also loved watching the Bellagio fountains out the windows. 

The only negative would be the price but I was aware of the prices before I went so I was not surprised when the bill came. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to any foodie who is looking for "an adventure in eating" while they are in Vegas.
