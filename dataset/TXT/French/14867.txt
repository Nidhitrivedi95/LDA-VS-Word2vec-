5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g My wife and I spent a weekend in Charlotte built around trying several restaurants of choice. Rooster's Uptown was the shining star. 

We had visited the bar on the prior afternoon just to check out venue but did not venture upstairs until the our dinner reservation on Saturday night. We had been viewing their menu on line and were pleasantly surprised by the second seasonal menu of the day.

We shared all of our selections including a roasted beet dish, and a seasonal salad that was a mix of fruit, and heirloom tomatoes, and while we loved it, can't recall all of the ingredients. I ordered the duck breast that was prepared perfectly medium rare with an amazing reduction sauce that our waiter said took a couple days to prepare.

My wife ordered the short ribs that she was thrilled with and a side of their Au Gratin potatoes. Great food at reasonable prices, attentive waiter, and a fun atmosphere centered around the open kitchen surrounded by counter like seating.

Loved Roosters!
