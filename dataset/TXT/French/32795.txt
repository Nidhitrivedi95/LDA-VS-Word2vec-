First of all keep pound cake simple. All those weird exoctic flavors that you add to the mix makes for a weird texture and taste. 

I ordered a Matcha Latte with Almond Milk. Yuck. It tasted like seaweed I couldn't even finish it. I nearly threw up I thought I was going to stroke out. The nice Security Guard at 1 First Canadian Place asked me if I needed an Ambulance I said no thank you. 

Goodness don't know how I will ever get over this traumatic event. 

Seriously Lavender Pound Cake? What kind of sick people do this to Pound Cake?
