I came here on my recent visit to Pittsburgh and picked up a small box of 6 macarons ($13). They were worth every penny!! I picked the unique flavors because YOLO. The white chocolate basil was freakin bomb dot com! It had a rich chocolate flavor that was balanced perfectly by the hint of basil :) the rose and nougatine were also amazing! Just check this place out, you won't regret it! :)
