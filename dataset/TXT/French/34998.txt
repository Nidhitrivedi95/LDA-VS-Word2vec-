We ordered a few cocktails which were all very delish (all I remember was the "Rambler"). They serve some bread in the beginning (naturally). We started the actual meal with the Shrimp Cocktail which was like every other shrimp cocktail I've had (which is fine, I enjoyed it). The layout of the shrimp was actually pretty unique.

To follow, the hubby had the Roasted Chicken (omg yum!) and I chose the Handmade Pasta, which varies by season apparently. Mine consisted of saffron linguine, lemon, mussles, crab, and godly flavor. Both dishes were visually appealing and tasted absolutely amazing. I should add that my dish was pretty small, which was great because I have a tiny tiny tiny stomach. The roasted chicken, however, was massive. My god. 

For dessert, we had the raspberry parfait which had interesting flavor. It was served with split pea ice cream. Eaten together, the mix of all flavors was really good but it took some getting used to. 

Our waiter was very nice and attentive. We are excited to try the other restaurants at the Cosmo since this one was a hit for us.
