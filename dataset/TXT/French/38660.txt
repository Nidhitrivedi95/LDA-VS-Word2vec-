jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg Mixed feelings. The said most popular sandwich (Croque Madame) unfortunately did not live up to the hype. The pressed croissant is what made it worthy of "best bakery in town"

I do give kudos to the establishment for having such a large kitchen, and for keeping the place so neat and tidy. Prices are a bit high, and they nickel and dime you for any kind of substitutions, which is what deters me from returning.
