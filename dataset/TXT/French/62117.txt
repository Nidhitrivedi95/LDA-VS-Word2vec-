SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Wonderful! All the reviews are legit!! 

Perfect place for a date or to celebrate an anniversary, bday or any other special occasion. Or just come to simply enjoy their pretty patio and delicious food. 

My husband and I came here for a day date on a Friday afternoon and arrived just in time to enjoy their lunch menu. Excellent service and the food was spectacular. Great portions too. Seemed like they just added a few new menu items but also keep some favorites for returning customers. 

We will definitely be back soon!
