A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g After our yummy meal at Pan Asian I knew I couldn't pass up the opportunity to visit Patisserie Manon. This place is so cute and alot bigger than what I thought. 
French yumminess totally surrounds you here....
I knew I had to try the French Macarons - we got vanilla, pistachio,cherry,and lemon. For a $1.00 each (YIKES) I thought they could've been bigger ( I've would've bought more if they more either bigger or more affordable) but they were chewy yummy. **I do like Project Cupcakes better though. ** 
We also got a few of their mini pastries - apple turnover,chocolate crossiant,almond, & custard. All were hit the spot good.
I like this place and was glad that I finally was able to try them out because this place is very out of the way for me. But, if I am in the area I will stop by again and try other yummy stuff here.
