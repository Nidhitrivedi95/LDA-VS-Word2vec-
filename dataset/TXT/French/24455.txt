cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I LOOOOOOOOVE their Foie Gras poutine! My husband and I went there with a strong recommendation from our hotel concierge; he even got us a table last minute! Small cozy bistro with heavenly delicious food, not with fancy deco, but a sincere attitude toward the food. I admire them. The wine list is relatively short, but the guy who took our order (I think he is Phil) recommended a very good Burgundy to our poutine; It's not an expensive selection, but it was good match. Their service was also attentive; we never had to ask for something; their staff really took a good care of us! Excellent orchestrated piece!
