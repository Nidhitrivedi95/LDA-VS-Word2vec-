O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q I absolutely love this place. It's hidden in the corner of warm springs and Tenaya so if you don't look carefully you might miss it. The ambience is very pretty and the service is impeccable. I love how at the end of each meal each time we have gone there the chef comes out to introduce himself and conversed with us about how we liked our dinner. The food is great and happy hour is even sweeter. I highly recommend the salmon ceviche and truffle marrow filet. They actually allowed us to get s truffle marrow with filet mignon for $8 more than the regular price of the truffle marrow but it was worth every penny!
