aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw My trip to Vegas was for a family event. I didn't get to explore as much as I wanted but being a lover of pastry, Bouchon was on my list. Good luck finding it - the Venetian is a maze. Even with a directory and asking folks who appeared to work at the hotel, it took a very, very long time. Pastry is your reward at the end of the line.  

When faced with a case full of buttery, flakey, goodness - I froze. What should I get? It was all overwhelming. Suffice to say that I walked out of there with a box of macaroons and a rather large box full of goodies. 

The macarons were packed well for travel so they went right into my carry-on bag. They were larger than what I typically see in Seattle. Win! They were also very well done with flavors that range from chocolate to pistachio to salted caramel. Kouign amann is at the top of my list since my friend introduced me to it years ago. This did not disappoint. A hard, sweet exterior surrounds buttery, velvety goodness inside. This is enough to ruin you forever! The croissants were very large and flakey. The pan au chocolate was very well done with the signature chocolate surrounded by croissant dough. Everything else is a blur. I'm fairly certain I bit everything in the box without regard to folks I was sharing with. 

Overall, a very good bakery that's very hard to find. It wasn't busy when I was there because other people were hunting for it like I was.
