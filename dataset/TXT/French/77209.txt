YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ I just ate at Mimi's for the last time. The service was less than friendly, the wait for our simple breakfast items was so slow it took us over 2 hours for our meal, and the food while sounding great on the menu was poorly executed with fair flavors. I was beyond disappointed.
