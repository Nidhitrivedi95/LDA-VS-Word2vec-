YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g I love a good meal, and boy did Fleur de Lys deliver! While working in Vegas this week, a friend and I decided to pop into Fleur de Lys for a quick dinner.

My first impression was "DAMN! $20 FOR SOUP!?" 

So of course, I had to try to the soup. And boy, it was the best truffle onion soup I've ever had. Delicate, yet loaded with flavor, rich and creamy... OMG. I will dream of this soup! Now THAT was worth $20.

I also tried the lobster salad... yummy but not as stand out as the soup. The lobster was butter poached, served with mango slices and a frisee salad. 

For my entree, I went with the Roast Chicken. Generally, I don't really like chicken because it's hard to do right. This chicken... this chicken... THIS CHICKEN was incredibly delicious. Seared skin, succulent, moist meat, flavorful... wholy crap, I ate the entire thing in about 5 minutes. Ha, there's $40 bucks down my throat hole!!

Oh yeah, and order the Chocolate Souffle for dessert. It was light, and airy but huge! It can easily be shared between 2-4 people!

All in all, wonderful service and delicious food. Good job Fleur de Lys!
