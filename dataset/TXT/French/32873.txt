H3gLUOAYxnYL6Rzgvq28Jg I love the idea of tapas style tartares and this place delivers on that 100%. From trout to horse, the variety of raw meat offered is rare and very tasty! Also, they hand out bread before the main course, which I find to be a rare event in Montreal. The bread isn't great but that's not why you come here.

I give it 4 stars because I'm not a huge fan of the ambiance/decor. On the other hand, we ate here on a Tuesday night so maybe we didn't get the full effect of a bustling restaurant.

tartares to try: the salmon with shrimp chips and the tuna/veal mix. I was a little disappointed with the duck but my bf liked it.
