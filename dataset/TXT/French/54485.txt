rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw My first time at a Michael Mina establishment and it was memorable.

I loved Bardot upon entry, we had a minor reservation snafu but the host quickly was able to take care of us. Bardot is sexy, chic with an easy sophistication. My senses were quickly stimulated and I quickly was enraptured in a laissez-faire attitude while thinking of what cocktail to have.

In my group, I had (forgive me for not having the exact names) Salmon with Beluga Lentils, started with an Endive Salad, and Lemon Meringue Tart for dessert. Salmon was robust and rich, and the Endive Salad balanced the strong flavors of the bleu cheese and endive perfectly in it's vinaigrette.

But that Lemon Meringue Tart? I'm still dreaming of it. It was THAT good.

If they offer you bread and butter here, definitely get it. That baguette is served perfectly warm and that butter is creamy.

Michael Mina isn't that everyday occasion, but I'll definitely find a reason to come back here!

The only disappointment was having a few glasses of rose and not finding a photo of Brigitte anywhere! Dommage.
