rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Typical overpriced Vegas fancy pants restaurant.

Pistachios to begin with.... ok. I'll eat them but it's still off.

What did I eat again? I can barely remember because it was that forgettable (paired with the excessive drinking).

Let me look the menu up online:

Pate- typical pate. it was good. nothing special.

Gnocchi- by far best dish of the night. Puffy little hot pockets of fluffy potato. Wow. I couldnt get enough!

We shared something else but I don't see it on the menu and I remember none of us liked it anyways... so better for the restaurant that we don't remember.

The place itself reminds me of a cafeteria. Also they don't serve bread plates because it's picnic style or some crap like that. There were crumbs everywhere!
