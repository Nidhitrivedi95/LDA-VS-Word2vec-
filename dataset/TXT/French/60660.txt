SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg favourite things about bonjour:

- fast take out on pastries and bread
- super yummy food!
- decent prices
- cute patio

cons:

- there is almost always a line up around the corner
- cash only
- almost all of the servers i've ever had seem grumpy and frazzled

ultimately, it's still one of my favourite brunch spots. delicious croissants, soups, sandwiches, and more! i just try to go during off-peak times.
