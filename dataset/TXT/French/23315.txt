C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA I have been wanting to go to Kalendar for 3 yrs! It's always too busy in summer. couple of times when I wanted to make reservation, it was fully booked for d time frame I was checking. And forgot what other reasons are, I just somehow never made it there. Maybe I always go Queen/King street since its closer to me. I heard good things about them long ago. I finally made it tonite! It didnt disappoint me. 

First of all, its on College Street. Away from downtown King Street West atmosphere. The moment you walk in, you will discover how inviting the place is. Everything seem to be little antique alike, but not boring. The menu is nicely printed. Everything is very Italian and...cute! 

I ordered wild mushroom risotto with cream sauce, sun dried tomato, asparagus, and chicken. It was absolutely delicious and extremely comforting. My friend had lamb chop, however he didnt like the mango sauce on lamb lol. So he ate the meat and ditched the sauce. I didnt get to try it so I cant comment on that mango lamb. I guess I would agree with him with the mango. Lamb suppose to have strong flavor itself, simple seasoning is enough, i dont know if it goes well with fruit. But I know i cant really say that because I actually didnt try lol. 

Cant believe my friend lives 1 min drive from there but never been there. He said he's def going back. So I guess I picked rite place. 4 Stars! I take 1 star off since he said he didnt like the mango sauce on lamb. lol. I will give 5 star for my dish. =D
