4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This place was great!  The food was superb, the staff was really on point even to the point of cleaning up the crumbs that were on our table.  The food was delicious and not extremely overpriced (esp for Vegas).  We managed to get some patte and corned beef on the cusp of breakfast/lunch.  Our waiter managed to sneak us in.  

However, the greatest perk of this restaurant is that it is right in front of the Belagio.  The fountain wasn't working when I was there, but I can imagine it going off while you're eating your meal.
