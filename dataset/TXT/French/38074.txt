JEXasd9XUHFbt_fIdmdK8g A really lovely meal and great addition to the neighbourhood. Started with oysters (wonderful and fresh as you would expect), scallops (less excited by these drenched in  buttermilk sauce) and pate with brioche- can't go wrong with that.  All accompanied with the warm, salty pretzel pieces. Spent most of my time eyeing other tables to see if they had any left. 

We had the Eurobass which was perfectly cooked - moist, flaky, well seasoned (it does pick up a bit of the salt from the crust but not overwhelming) and a big portion. Duck which again was very good - rich, perfectly cooked and well seasoned. The portion was huge - a really big duck breast almost too much. Trout was similarly perfect - well seasoned, reasonable portion and a bit lighter. Sides of mushrooms - woodsy and taste like real mushrooms and brocolini - crisp , warm and well cooked. 

Make sure you make room for the gateau. Warm, moist with a light crisp exterior and warm rich interior. Elegant and perfect with its minimalism. We had with the salted caramel ice cream, which I would skip next time (strong caramel, a bit on the toasted side and aggressively salted)


Good wine list. Attentive and informed service.  Loud place for conversation - we were at the front, looks more intimate at the back. 

With drinks and some good wine not hard to drop $500 for four ($$$$).
