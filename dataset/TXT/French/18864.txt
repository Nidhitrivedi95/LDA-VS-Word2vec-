The violet gelato was really good - it was lighter and airier than other gelato but went really well together with the creme brûlée flavor. I also got a box of six macarons . I liked the vanilla one but the other flavors were drier, even when I tried them on the same day as when I bought them. I would stick with a place that makes macarons onsite instead of here, but if you're looking for ice cream, this place is a much better option than Creamistry across the way.
