aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Bouchon Bakery is amazzzing!  I have been looking for a unique bakery in Vegas, namely one that makes chocolate croissants.  This place has it all!  Their croissants are amazing.  Flaky, buttery, sweet and just PERFECT.  Strawberry is probably my fave.  I tried the pistachio macaroon, as that is what the barista said was most popular (along with the vanilla).  I loved everything about it and anticipate tasting all the macaroon flavors one day.  I've found a little piece of heaven in this Sin City.  FINALLY!  And it's located in the Venetian Hotel- my fave!
