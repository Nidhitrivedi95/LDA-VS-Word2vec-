KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA This was my first dinning experience at this restaurant and I'm sorry to report that chances are slim to none that I will ever return.  The service was average at best, wait time was much slower than it should be.  The champagne arrived warm and it took over 20 minutes for it to get to an acceptable chill.  I had to ask the waiter to please bring more ice since when we complained that it was warm and they didn't respond.

We shared the foie gras and it was extremely small for $20 and the toast served with it was so heavily drenched in butter it overpowered the taste.  We had to ask for plain bread instead.  We then had the salmon entree and a side order of the mac n cheese.  Very nice flavor and we left feeling satisfied.

However, around 5 hours later, we both started experiencing stomach cramps and diarrhea.  This went on all night long.  I wasn't happy about spending $180 for dinner and getting sick, so the next morning I called to tell management our experience.  I wasn't sure what to, but I thought they should know.  She spoke to me very courteously, but basically said, ' they checked all their food for expiration, and no one else complained".  This reaction annoyed me.  I feel at the very least an apology was in order and perhaps offer of something on our next visit, anything!  This is very poor customer service and I will not return there again.  There are too many places for fine dinning here, i don't have to patronize an establishment that is not concerned about my comfort or satisfaction.
