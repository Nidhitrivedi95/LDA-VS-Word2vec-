SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ NEVER had a better glass of chocolate milk than I did here - it's made with German chocolate!  I really respect the farm-to-table concept, but the congestion of the parking lot, entry, to-go queue, register, dining space, and neighborhood is just way too intense for a pleasurable meal.
