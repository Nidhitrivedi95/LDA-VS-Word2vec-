4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Great location and upscale bistro environment. Served great french bread and corn relish upon arrival. Had the stuffed pork chops with caramelized onions. Very tasty, albeit very small portion--- 3 slices. The salad was disappointing... unremarkable dressing and lack of presentation. The service was great... our waiter was attentive and informative. It's the cost ratio for me here... basic french... nothing mouth -tingling! If I wanted a steak, I would probably go elsewhere.
