4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Traditional French fare at the heart of the Las Vegas Strip that never fails to satisfy.  Whether you're a regular or virgin at Mon Ami Gabi please make sure you save room for dessert.  Perhaps do what I've done, just make the dining experience a dessert filled table;)  made from scratch and sinfully delicious desserts.  Yes, I have a sweet tooth- have you not seen my pictures!  
I've dined here numerous times over the years, yes Food and not only dessert.  
Onion soup, steak frites and those mussels mariniere! The mussels, I have will power and have the half order. Yes, half so I can clearly utilize that doughy stuff by scooping up the white wine & herbs broth:) 
You can't go wrong with pretty much anything the menu offers, so peruse that menu and order away!
