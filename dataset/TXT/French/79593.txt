I enjoyed the French onion soup and the escargot that I ordered; both items came with bread and salad, so I got more of those sides than I had expected. My dinner companions let me sample the desserts they ordered and these were really heavenly. The relaxed atmosphere is conducive to leisurely dining and conversation, and although they do not serve alcohol, you can bring your own; just be aware that there is a corkage fee. Those who hesitate to partake of French cafe fare because of either the expense or the sometimes snobbish atmosphere generally associated with such places should come and try this delightful café.
