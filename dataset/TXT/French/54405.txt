rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw The advertisement for BARDOT playing on Aria sign off Las Vegas strip drew me in, congrats. 

Concierge  at Aria made a reservation for me. I arrived promptly at my reservation time and was seated in the bar area. I received a glass of water and menu. Then I sat there for over ten minutes looking over the menu, I had decided that I was going to have the lobster. 

Another few minutes passed, still no sign of a server, just a stream of staff walking past me. I looked again at the menu, got up and walked out. 

I really wanted to eat here, but couldn't allow myself to spend this kind of money to wait 10-15 mins just for a server to get to my table. Management should be closely watching the activity of their restaurant, you let money walk out the door.
