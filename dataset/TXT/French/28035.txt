DZkl5MleRKh0isxj1Y2Abg Disappointing. We were looking forward to this visit, but it didn't work. The apps were good, the mains less so. Ttoro had good broth but was undistinguished fish, ok shrimp, terrible mussels. The chicken was all right but not great, the mushroom dish good. Wine was expensive. In all we expected more for $100 each. I don't think we will be back.
