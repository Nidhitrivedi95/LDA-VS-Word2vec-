9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg Went here for a special 5 year anniversary  dinner with my DH, and the folks definitely made it special for us! (disclaimer: it helped that we knew the sous chef)
They started us off with a complimentary glass of champagne, and the servers were exceptionally polite and knowledgeable.

Our favourite thing was their Crispy Duck Egg....sooo good.  It was smoky with the bacon, perfectly fried and crispy on the outside, and then velvety smooth inside with an exquisite soft yolk.  It was comforting and luxurious at the same time.  I could eat that for brunch, lunch, or dinner any day!

We planned to order off their menu but the servers convinced us to order their special of the day which was a stuffed whole fish with lobster and scallops and served with a creamed corn and a bunch of other sides.  It cost around $90, but it was meant for 2 people, so we tried it, and it was amazing!

We were going to leave after dinner as we had to catch a cab to get to our show, but they gave us a complimentary dessert, which was very nice but nothing that was really memorable.  

And yes, we ended up being late for the musical and were one of those people who walk to their seats during a scene change.  oops!
