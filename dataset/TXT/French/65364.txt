u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA A must check place in Montreal! the sake bombs are sooo fun and unique, definitely good idea, their other cocktails are also amazing, I tried hello kity and several other one i forgot the name but they were all delicious, comparable, maybe even better than the cocktails from 3 amigos. Their side dishes come in small portion and match well with the drinks. This place have a funky and urban atmosphere, owned by real japanese badass haha a must in montreal!
