MxHZ5XwIQWnJFTw9gZxAIg With hardly two hours to kill between shows, the boy and I dashed up to Grassmarket from the Royal Lyceum, starving and desperate. I mentioned that I've been wanting to try Maison Bleue, from the look of their menu, and we squeaked in just in time to catch the tail end of the pre-theatre menu. (Well, more like inter-theatre menu in our case, but I digress.) £12 for two courses? Don't mind if I do.

Of course, I quickly ruined the deal by ordering a £25 bottle of Australian Shiraz Tempranillo while the boy was in the loo - luckily he wasn't too upset once he tried the wine because it was quite delicious. Worth the price tag and then some.

For our starters we had the smoked salmon & mackerel rilettes and the steamed Shetland mussels - both great, although the crostini for my rilettes were a little on the tooth-breakingly hard side. No matter. For mains I opted for the chicken tagine while the boy went with the steak. Again, both great, although I did wish my tagine was a little less authentic in that it had boneless chicken. Again, no matter - the flavors were worth it. Pleasantly stuffed, we lingered too long over our wine and had to book it back to the Lyceum, squeaking in just before curtain. The moral of this story is: don't do like we did - give yourself plenty of time to enjoy Maison Bleue, because it deserves to be enjoyed.
