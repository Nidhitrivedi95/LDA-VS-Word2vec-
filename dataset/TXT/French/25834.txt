Last November for my big 30th birthday I and several of my close friends came to Vegas to celebrate.  They surprised me with a birthday dinner reservation at the well known Mix.  This restaurant is located at the top of the THEhotel (on the 64th floor!!!!) adjoining Mandalay Bay.  What this means is that the view is OUTSTANDING because it faces the entire strip.  Outstanding or maybe breathtaking?  Hard to say which one.  This restaurant is truly stunning.  Example:  your view of the strip is a complete 360 thanks to floor-to-ceiling windows, which are everywhere including the bathroom.  Make sure you visit the bathroom!

Let's start with the 24 foot chandelier that has literally 15,000 hand blown glass spheres.  Beautiful.  The entire interior is chic modern, and almost glows like the sheen you see on bubbles.  Attached to the restaurant is the lounge, which has an open deck facing the strip where you can get the best views.  

Next, the food:  exquisite.  World famous French chef Alain Ducasse is at the helm at Mix and he does not disappoint.  Most everything here is French based, and our table partook in all the high points of the menu from the soups to the steaks to the foie gras.  (And for the record yes I felt guilty eating foie gras).  There is nothing on this menu that you could order and not love.

Mix was kind enough to let my friends bring over a birthday cake from Freed's bakery and they cut up the cake and served it for us.  Our waiter was very professional and knowledgeable.  This is a must place to eat and see the views when in Vegas.
