I ordered the foie gras with a glass of the Bartender's Choice as my happy hour cocktail, which happened to be on this day a smooth and simple concoction of tequila with a splash of lime. Eric, the bartender who served me, was very professional and pleasant. The foie gras was delicious. It was served with thick, fresh from the oven bread. It was a perfectly smooth texture. This particular foie gras is served with ruby port gelee, so if you like it without the sweetness of the "jam" you may want to let the server/bar staff know so they can accommodate you. I finished my happy hour with a slice of lemon meringue tarte. I don't like my desserts too sweet and this one was a smidgen on the sweet side, but the right amount of lemon flavor was the redeeming quality.

It was a nice happy hour for a last night in Vegas. I'll go back for a proper lunch or dinner since my experience was a positive one.
