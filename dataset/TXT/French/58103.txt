rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I've been to this place at least a half a dozen times, almost every time I've been to vegas, I HAVE to go for brunch.  The price is reasonable since there is such a wide variety of different brunch items.  Here's what I would recommend:

Salmon platter - so so fresh - will hit the spot if you want GOOD smoked salmon

Chicken and Waffles - the most crispy yet tender waffle with a prefectly roasted chicken

French Fries - weird to order this for breakfast but you just have to do it.  They are that perfect.  

Bacon - who doesn't love crispy bacon?

Berries - Perfect mix of strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries with a vanilla bean cream.  I've ended every meal with this because it will cut the richness of whatever you order and make you feel like you had a dessert.  

Can't wait to try the rest of the brunch menu!

ENJOY!
