Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA The view is the best part of the restaurant, and a good portion of it is blocked by poorly positioned bathrooms.  Some bad design choices.  Oh, and getting seated underneath the chandelier with the low ceilings is awful.  Try not to be there.

The food was hit or miss; the lamb was excellently prepared, but the strip looked terrible.  The gnocchi was flavorful and well balanced, while the lobster salad was bland and forgettable.  

And whatever the name of the dessert with the armagnac-soaked bread is, it's terrible.  Avoid at all costs.

Service was average; my water wasn't refilled nearly quickly enough, and drinks were very slow in coming.  The servers also screwed up plating virtually everyone's appetizers, which was more entertaining than annoying, but still worth noting.

Being Vegas, you can do better.
