4cWrtMvfj-tomyEPgP7KFg Recently went for their "endless" special which included a cheese, endless salad, endless entree, and endless dessert. 

Our waitress, Jennifer, was awesome! She took great care of us, and even after getting a big party, she made sure that the managers came to check on us regularly. 

Spinach and artichoke cheese fondue was delicious, probably the best one I've had. Since the entree was endless, we were able to have all of the types of meat (filet mignon, teriyaki sirloin, herb crusted chicken, shrimp, and BBQ rubbed pork tenderloin). All of them were delicious and trying them with all the different sauces was great. 

We ended up ordering a "snickers" chocolate that wasn't even on the menu because the manager recommended it and it didn't disappoint! We also ended up getting the "turtle" chocolate, which we have had before and it was great, as always. 

This location definitely deserves 5 stars! They went above and beyond to make sure we were well taken care of and that all of our food was as great as it could have possibly been!
