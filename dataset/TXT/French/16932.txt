8xCiibfgqy-8xpCWEaguqg Location is key for this iteration of the Keg formula. I went on a Sunday night...no hockey game, all the shops closed, the downtown core almost empty with a minus 25 chill blowing through the PVM plaza, yet at 5:30 a 45 minute wait for a table. Luckily, my companions arrived at 5:15 and already had a table. (They don't take reservations). Swanky is a good word for the vibe, but the clientele doesn't reflect that particular feeling. It was more like Howard Johnston's family crowd, understandable for a early Sunday dinner. I get that they pull people from the Queen E Hotel across the street. Still, the low light, minimalist decor, and the lovely young women in little black dresses create a certain cognitive dissonance for one's dinning experience.
As for the food, two out of four orders at the table scored big disappointments. My Keg Classique sirloin was blue when ordered medium rare and was sinewy. I had to cut it as thin as possible to not end up with a sore jaw. On a positive note, the pepper whiskey sauce was very tasty. The Kansas City cut ended-up on my host's plate in a mangled mess. He remarked to the waiter that the butcher needed to be replaced. I don't know if it was the providence of the beef or its preparation or lack thereof, but it's been a while since I worked so hard to eat a piece of steak.
The well-adorned baked potato was a welcome respite from my laboured mastication.
The "sorry about that" came to the table in the form of a comped piece of the ice cream cake. It was delicious. The blueberry tea was served with Black tea instead of Orange Pekoe which changes the taste considerably...it was reported that either the Amaretto or the Grand Marnier was missing.
The service is professional and the process of getting dinner was great, but the product I was served left quite a bit to be desired.
