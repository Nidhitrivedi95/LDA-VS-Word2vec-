Maybe it was that two of us ordered the degustation menu and two only an appetizer and entree but, when we hadn't gotten our entrees after 2 1/2 hours, we were less than happy.  When we told the waiter that we were full and wanted to leave and could you please box up the rest of the food, we waited another twenty minutes at which point he brought out our entrees.  

I can't really fault the food.  Most of it was really delicious.  I really liked the duck that I got for my entree and would have really liked it later except the waiter threw it away and then tried to pretend that he didn't hear me say I wanted it boxed up.

To be fair, we spoke with the manager who comped an entire degustation meal but, even then, we spent $300.  I don't know if they were having an off night but the couple beside us and another table near us waited as long or longer and were also not very happy.  I'm pretty sure the large party near us also complained.

I might go back but probably only for the pre-theater menu.  It's too bad their service is so awful because the food is really good.  As a side note, the only thing I didn't like was the sea bass.  It had an odd flavor and seemed overcooked.
