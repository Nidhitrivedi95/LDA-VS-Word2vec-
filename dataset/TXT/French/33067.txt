HcZKGEQFOYUJKbVHyF-tQg Subpar food and slow service. Caters almost exclusively to tourists and 50 & over clientele. Feels stuffy and underwhelming especially during off hours and weekdays. More authentic and better valued French bistros by the handful within a 2 block radius alone. Would not recommend even out of curiosity or ironic detachment.
