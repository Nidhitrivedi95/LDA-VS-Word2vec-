ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Went for late night food, around midnight.  I got the french dip sandwich w/ french fries.  Not only was the bread stale, but the meat was a dryer version of the worst roast beef you've ever had.  In addition, the french fries actually came out cold and stale!  I tried flagging down my waitress to address the situation but it was impossible to flag her down.  Terrible service, terrible food, go to Denny's instead for your late night munchies fix.
