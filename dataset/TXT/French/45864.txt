mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q We were a group of 8 people for dinner at Joel Robuchon at the MGM Grand. At the onset we had a wonderful experience and everyone had an amazing time.
I had the kampachi fish and the sautéed  pork  with the mashed potatoes. Their french style mashed potatoes are out of the world and to die for. The fish was nicely cooked and it had a very unique texture and taste. It was so good that several people at our table changed their orders and decided to get it. The pork with truffles was heavenly too. It went great with the mashed tomatoes and the red wine that the server recommended. Finished it off with Mango soufflé for dessert. Overall an amazing food experience. Must recommend for everyone.
