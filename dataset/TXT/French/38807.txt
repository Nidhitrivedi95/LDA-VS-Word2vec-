jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg Adorable little French cafe. They offer tons of pastries, as well as breakfast and lunch options. I tried the Croque-Monsieur, which was a very nice portion, and was served with a small side salad. The bf tried a croissant ham and cheese which he said was good also, but he preferred my order instead (it was packed with delicious cheese -his favorite)

We also ordered a few mini macarons, all house made, and very tasty. Yum!

I would absolutely recommend this cafe!
