The restaurant overall has a nice set up with outside seating and an inside bar area. I wanted to order the duck, but was told it was breaded and fried so I went with the scallops. They were not great, I have definitely had better at a few other restaurants in the area. 

I would suggest going there, it doesn't seem over priced and they have some other tasty looking items on the menu.
