SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Love this place!!! First time here, all I can say it mouthwatering! Began with a black and blue specialty drink that was recommended by our waitress. Then I got the chicken confit after yelping what I should get..lol. And ended the meal with a pistachio cake. Everything was delicious, but let me just take a second to say the pistashio cake was the bomb!! Do not leave until you have had pistachio cake...that's how good it was!! The restaurant provided a very romantic ambience--perfect for date night. Lastly, I just want to comment that our waitress was super friendly and provided excellent service..loved her accent!
