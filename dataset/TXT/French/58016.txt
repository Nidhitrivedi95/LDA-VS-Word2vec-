rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Had lunch here recently with a good friend. The service is so good and the food is even better! I enjoyed the Salmon lox on baguette - OMG delicious and such generous portions. My friend had eggs benedict. Loved it. The only bummer was the waiter said they were out of the cheese  pastry but on the way out, we saw plenty of them. We went downstairs and got one from the Bouchon counter - crisis averted! I'll be back next time we are in Vegas, for sure.
