vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q This was an absolutely amazing surprise and definitely one of the best fine dining experiences I've had. 

Right away the service was spot on surpassing anything else I've had on the strip, everyone seemed like they enjoyed their job and actually wanted to be there. While everyone did an excellent job William the sommelier was a true stand out not just for his attitude but for his amazing wine selections. 

The discovery wine pairing truly is a discovery of unique wines instead of just a fancy label for the cheaper option. 

The food of course was amazing with flavors you wouldn't imagine going together being blended perfectly, everything was served in its proper order and all temperatures were correct. 

This meal really did remind me of what fine fine dining is supposed to be. Even though I was the last person to leave for the evening instead of having just one or two employees rushing to get off shift I had the entire staff to make sure my meal was perfect till the end.
