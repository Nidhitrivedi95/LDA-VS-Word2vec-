mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Service was wonderful (it did help that I knew the vice-GM).  Atmosphere was contemporary with a focus on the kitchen area where you can watch all the makings of the food.  The bar-type setting was original and functional.  Be sure to make reservations, especially on a weekend.  

I had the summer prix fixe menu for $79 and a glass of champagne (which I forgot the name).

Amuse Bouche - Foie gras w/ port reduction and form Parmesan served in a shot glass. 10/10: I've never had an amuse bouche that wasn't delectable, but I wanted thirds and fourths servings of this particular one.

Les Legumes - Layers of tomato, eggplant, zucchini with Buffalo Mozzarella and dabs of Basil puree on the side.  7/10: This was my least favorite dish, yet it was still enjoyable.  

La Langoustine - Crispy Langoustine Fritter with Basil Pesto.   9/10: The textures involved were smooth and stiff while well balanced.

4th dish - Can't remember the dish, but it had beef (I want to say some type of hanger steak) and mashed potatoes.  9/10: The mashed potatoes were buttery, rich, and creamy.  It's actually the best mashed potatoes I've ever had.  The beef was well seasoned and very juicy.

Les Fromages - Blue cheese, Creamy sheep cheese and Camembert.  9/10:  I wish I could savor the cheeses fully, but I was already borderline full by the time I reached this dish.  I love cheese and L'Atelier was very close to representing a variety makes of cheese with only three types.

Sorbet Selection - 8/10:  By this time, I was was pass full, but I did try to savor each sorbet.  I believe there were at least 6 different types.  I remember one making my face wrinkle due to the level of tartness.  The company I came with had the traditional tarts, which were tasteful and also had a very acidulous tart.

I would definately come back here when visiting Vegas.
