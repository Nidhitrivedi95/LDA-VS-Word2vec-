Came here at my woman's request and you know that needs to be followed.  Only two prix fixe meals here.  I had one and the woman had the other.  I had the titled Prix Fixe Menu and she had the titled Degustation Menu.  For my meal, I had the quail salad which was excellent, the black bass which was AMAZING, and the veal chop that was superb.  The woman had the Maine lobster salad and pan seared scallop which were both just okay to me, the foie gras with pistachios was THE BEST, and the lamb which was a little bit better than okay.  Other than the foie gras with pistachios, I thought my cheaper prix fixe menu was better.  If I was just rating my meal, Food would be a 5.  I gave a 4 to price because, in my opinion, I just don't think the 2 meals were worth the price.  Would I come back?  Definitely, if someone else is paying.  If I was paying, probably.
