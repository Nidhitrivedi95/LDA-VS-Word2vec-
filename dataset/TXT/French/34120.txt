hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Another 5 star review for Baguette Cafe! What's not to like about this charming establishment? The location, maybe, although the journey there makes the reward even more satisfying.

I had been once before to sample a couple of sandwiches and the service was spectacular! The curried chicken sandwich was creamy and bold, while the basque pork sandwich had an entirely rustic profile.

Fast forward 8 months- I needed a place to study while munching something delicious and didn't want to end up in a Starbucks. I remember how much I loved Baguette Cafe months ago and decide to head there for lunch. Olivier actually remembers me (crazy!) and once again provided such a charming and personalized interaction. Ever helpful, and always ready to make a suggestion for those who are most indecisive (me). He noticed I had my laptop with me and right off the bat gave me the wifi password. Even the guy who delivered my food was funny, very helpful and got me more hot water for my tea as well as a slice of the peach custard tart so I wouldn't have to wait in line again.

On my most recent visit I tried the breakfast croissant with tomato instead of any meat. The flakiest croissant (baked fresh that morning, naturally) filled with a tomato jam and omelet style eggs filled with swiss and spinach. It came with a little salad (mostly a garnish) on the side, and was just right. It was satisfying, but light enough for me to still have room for that delectable peach tart afterwards. While the peaches aren't fresh, the custard is surprisingly eggy in a pleasant way, and the crust was just tender enough.

The chocolate tart looked amazing, dense and decadent, but I decided I'm saving that one until my next visit when I can pawn half of it off on a friend =)

It certainly won't take another 8 months for me to return.
