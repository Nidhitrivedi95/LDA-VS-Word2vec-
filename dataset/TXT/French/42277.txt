L3VlGzHgsbmaZ5oUnWvINg Nice place for date night! Great selection of wines, cheese, fruit & crackers or hummus & pita. and a enchanting atmosphere. They also carry an assortment of imported beers. The owner is always around and working hard to satisfy customers. A beautiful smoke free outdoor patio deck overlooking the Cuyahoga river. There are a few small tables indoors but not a lot of room,  so they wouldn't be the best place for a gathering of people during rain or colder months.
