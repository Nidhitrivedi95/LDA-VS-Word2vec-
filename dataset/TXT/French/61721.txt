sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g This is a nice cozy atmosphere with dim lighting, it would be great for a quiet date night. I attended for the first time during Restaurant Week. As a disclaimer everyone should expect delays during restaurant week. A restaurant can go from 5 reservations on Tuesday to 30 during restaurant week. It is an adjustment. We were a party of 4. The bartender was good, be sure to ask for the liquid sunshine :). We met the owner and she was very pleasant. I enjoyed the saffron papperdelle pasta which was seasoned very well and the collard greens added extra texture.  We were able to sample each others food and the steak medallions were cooked properly but I wish there was more coffee crust on them. The carrot-ginger soup was not heavy on the ginger, which I liked. The macaroni and cheese could have used more cheese sauce, it was not as creamy as I would like. But it had a good flavor. Overall I enjoyed this place and the location. My group will come back after restaurant week.
