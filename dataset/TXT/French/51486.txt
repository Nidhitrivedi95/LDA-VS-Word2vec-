pfg6zkYnNvFM7Tr1TLzBvA This little place was my first meal in Scotland. I just arrived yesterday and walked over to Bijou Bistro since I knew it is just down the road from the guest house I'm staying at. Thanks to Yelp and the reviewers for helping me find this little gem. This cute little eatery has wonderful atmosphere and charm. Since I am travelling alone, I appreciated the small table by the window where I could enjoy my meal while watching the parade of people and cars go by. The music was enjoyable and the lady working there is such a sweetheart. She made me feel so welcomed and took excellent care of me. The food was top notch as well. I definitely plan on returning for another meal or two before I leave next week. Thanks for the great introduction to Scottish hospitality!
