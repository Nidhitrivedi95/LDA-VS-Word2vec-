aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw We passed by bouchon bakery a few times a day going up to our room & didn't try this place until the very last day!
-toasted ham & cheese sandwich on a baguette: the best ham & cheese sandwich! Seriously! Who knew something so simple would be so good? I think I really liked the toasted baguette the best. & they just don't toast it, they put it in a panini grill so it gets crispy on both sides.  
-macarons: I was glad to see that these macarons made it through some outlet shopping in 100 degree weather & through the airplane ride home & was still presentable to give to my family. I got coffee & chocolate. These macarons are BIG...& cost $3.50 each! But it was worth trying!
-iced vanilla latte: for some reason this iced coffee was really good! The coffee was strong & the vanilla made it just sweet enough. 
-almond brioche: imagine an almond croissant. Now take away the croissant & your left with the almonds & almond paste inside. Put this on top of a piece of thick, cripsy bread & you have almond brioche. I was good, but I like almond croissants better.    

Overall I enjoyed bouchon bakery & wish there was a closer one!
