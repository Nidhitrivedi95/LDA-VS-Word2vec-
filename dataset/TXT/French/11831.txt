4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We went here 3 times while we were in Vegas in January.

The first time my husband ordered over medium eggs. They were not good. The yolks were so done that there was no liquid. They remade them and they were ok. 

The second time was for dinner. The steak was amazing and wine was wonderful. Our waiter was great. You could see the fountain show from across the street. Very romantic.

The third time was for breakfast. I had eggs benedict. They were very good. The problem came when the man went to take my plate and hit it off my water. The water fell into my lap. My pants were soaking wet. Very very wet. Vegas is huge and so now you have to walk who knows how long soaked. The man apologized but that was it. I know the manager saw but never said a word. I think he could have at least came over to apologize. It was very cold in Vegas in January and now I have to walk outside with my entire lap soaking wet. I just think it was bad on their part.
