Ycp3Agr7dt71TZkeKV7jng I simply don't understand why Le Gourmand is as busy as it is. The food is pretty tasty, but they often run out of certain items and the service is awful. It's so chaotic trying to get food or a coffee, no matter what time of day I go there. 

To boot, I've ordered a latte from here on three different occasions and they're always terrible. The foam is disappointing and they're incredibly acidic. To boot, the last time I ordered a latte here THREE people who ordered AFTER me got served their espresso-based beverages first (cappuccino, americano, machiato) . I HATE when that happens. 

I've finally decided to stop ordering coffee here and stop going for lunch here. It's always a frustrating and disappointing experience.
