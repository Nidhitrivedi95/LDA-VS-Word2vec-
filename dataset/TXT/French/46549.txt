nKeGPmH5dYNVL5AyAItuKg My boyfriend and I tried Chantecler for the first time this Tuesday. We stopped in on a whim around 9pm and were seated within minutes even though it was pretty packed. 

First of all, I love the decor and I think this small space is really warm and charming. I love the tiles on the walls and floor and the bar is absolutely beautiful. 

We ordered two house lagers, which were pretty good, and asked the waiter for food recommendations. He advised us to get the calamari and popcorn shrimp. We also ordered some fish wraps. The calamari came first and it was our favorite. Seasoning and texture were pleasant and we quickly finished the plate. The popcorn shrimp came next and while we appreciated how large the shrimp were and the creativity of it being covered in actual popcorn, the shrimp itself was tasteless and the seasoning had no subtlety to it. While the concept of the fish wraps is great, they were also a little bland with too little garniture and the sauce tasted just like straight-up mayo. Bottom line: this place is great for a date, grabbing a few drinks, and snacking. Don't come here famished. 

Overall, the staff was super nice and we have a lovely experience at Chantecler and think it's a great little neighborhood spot.
