xeFVRUjxorxjO_qjX8FNdw Went for lunch here since I was in the area and someone closeby recommended it. The places packed so service was a bit slow but the waitress did apologize a few times for the wait. As for the food, I was blown away by every dish that I tried. There was a lunch special roasted red pepper and tomato soup for $5 that was absolutely delicious. Very fresh ingredients and very flavorful. The beef tip crepe, which was also a lunch special item was a bit pricey at $17 but the meal exceeded my expectations. Very balanced flavours. Tender beef tips, exceptional gravy served in a light crepe with a refreshing balsamic vinegar salad. I shared another lunch menu special, the special wrap, which had sausage and sauerkraut with a dijon mustard. Great pairing of flavors on the plate. Dessert, which I found out was their specialty was equally as scrumptious. Picked out a walnut crunch pie from the display case. Amazing dessert for $5.50, which needed to be split for 2 people. Not too sweet but very rich and beautifully presented on the plate with whip cream and a raspberry coulis. Pistachio ice cream for $2.50 was very fresh, had chunks of pistachios and was also delicious. Definitely worth another visit as I highly recommend this place if it's within your budget. A lot more menu items that I'll need to try out.
