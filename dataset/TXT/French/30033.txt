FNroBu0T0TmmMwLqNZqvaw I had an item from their special selection, chevale. Horse meat. First time having horse. It was incredible. The grilled vegetables were amazing, with pesto, they included fiddle heads, my fav. And the poutine was quite unique with a Quebec blue cheese gravy. Salty and amazing. The best dinner I've had in Montreal so far. And the chef came out to ask me how my food was. I loved that.
