AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw We were a bit confused at first.  When you first enter Caesar's there's a Payard Express, then a place that is called Payard but only sells the pastries, and then, walk a LITTLE further, and, there's the sit down place.

We didn't make reservations for breakfast.  Oops.  Thank goodness they were able to seat us.  It's a brief menu, but the items on it sure did sound delicious.  I was torn between the Lobster Eggs Benedict with waffles and the Salmon Croque Madame.  In the end, I chose the Salmon Croque Madame.

Wish I picked the Lobster Eggs Benedict.

But the food was delicious.  My food came with two runny eggs (I like runny eggs) on top which heightened the flavor of the dish.  Without it, my dish would probably have been "blah", and I would have been terribly disappointed.

The service was lacking.  For such a snooty place, I felt our waiter was a bit rude to my friend and I, consistently serving the table next to us, and ignoring any of our breakfast needs.  Yes, water was refilled and coffee replenished, but not by our waiter.  Our waiter barely ever stopped at our table.  To the waiter who served us, you are lucky you were redeemed by the smiling man who refilled my water.  But the tip was for you, and I hope you realized that.

We took a quick stop at the bakery/cafe/bistro place next door to swipe some other goodies like packaged chocolates and an almond croissant for the road.  The almond croissant was delicious.  I probably could have had that and a good cup of coffee for breakfast and enjoyed it more.
