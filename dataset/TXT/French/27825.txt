dU7SLTS6_HWo1YPHZ4DmOw This was a hard call between 3 and 4 stars!

3 for food, but 4 for service. Overall experience, 3.5 stars.

My fam and I went for Sunday brunch. The restaurant was very quaint. The waitress was super friendly and very knowledgeable about the food. She knew the different types of radish in my salad, which is pretty impressive. Service was good. I did have to ask for refills, but I want to acknowledge that there was only 1-2 people serving and the place was full. 

Food wasn't bad, but nothing truly stood out. I ordered the French onion soup and eggs Benny. I didn't like the French onion soup. I found it too salty and it wasn't cheesy enough. They added bread in the soup, which became pretty soggy after a while.

The salad was pretty good. The brioche was homemade and was very moist.  Bacon was a bit hard. Eggs and sauce was good. 

The food was plated nicely.

My partner had the fried chicken. It was moist and filling, but he wouldn't put this on his top 3 of amazing fried chicken he had. 

Portions are fair. We had left overs, which I ate the next day and it was still good. I would come back for dinner.
