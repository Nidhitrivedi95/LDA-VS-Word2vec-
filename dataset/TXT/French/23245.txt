C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA I came here with my boyfriend for a mid-day brunch. Cute, friendly atmosphere..but I wasn't impressed by the service. I ordered a vegetarian quiche and my boyfriend got the burger. After ~25 minutes of waiting in the quiet, empty restaurant the server came and told us they were out of the burgers and said she should've told us earlier. My boyfriend reordered steak frites and after another 15 mins or so it came out...and my quiche was the salmon one. At this point I was too hangry to wait for a reorder, so I just ate it. It wasn't bad but I would've preferred the veggie one. My boyfriend ordered his steak med rare as well, and it came out med-med well. Could've been an off day for the server/kitchen but it was, nonetheless, a first impression. Probably wouldn't have cared as much if I wasn't fixed for time.
