OdjINFB2qGR57eWw2nwCsQ Found this place online. It was brand new and already listed in the top 10 restaurants in Montreal. The atmosphere is wonderful and it had a very good vibe. Impeccable service from the get go. We just happened to be seated next to the chef's mother! Our meals were excellent to say the least. Steak with Asian chimichuri. When I asked if they could do something special for my wife's birthday, our server returned with a one off custom made desert. It was an great experience overall. To top things off, the chef came out to talk to his mom and she sent him to our table. We showered him with praise.
