mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog This is supposed to be the best restaurant in Montreal. Or at least the best from what I researched and found. So we were excited to secure a reservation (albeit a pretty late one) on our weekend trip here.

Food was good, not phenomenal. I had the foie gras tasting dinner while he had the regular tasting. Silly me, I requested for the foie in the form of a terrine instead. The chef was able to accomodate my request and I enjoyed the terrine (thinking back now, I wonder if I made the right decision to swap...) but later on in the tasting, I somehow felt that the taste of dishes seem similar to that of the terrine (probably because he used the same ingredients e.g. strawberries etc). He said I can't really judge it since I requested  a swap... perhaps I should have stuck to the original menu. Oh well. 

I'm not a big fan of their squab. The meat itself it too gamey for me. However, I did enjoy dinner here. My very first tasting! We spent a bomb here that night. I offered to split but he took on the entire bill. So sweet.
