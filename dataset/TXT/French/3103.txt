1aj4TG0eFq6NaPBKk6bK7Q Great little visit with my girlfriend at Jacque's Cafe. It's a nice secret out in Summerlin. Although it's a little dark, it helps create a more personal ambiance with your company.

I had the Baja Burger with avocado and French fries. With the chorizo and jalapeño cheese it was a triumph of flavor. My "side" was the Bonini burger, a deep fried burger essentially enveloped in a pancake. Inner fat kid rejoiced. 

Staff came to assist us even though we spent ample time scouring the menu deciding what to order at a table...and you're supposed to order at the register prior. Great service throughout! Very friendly staff.

My girl had the Provence style beef short ribs with grilled vegetables. The entree was savory. The only shortcoming was the lack of options for her side dish.

We will return to try the Asian burger and a salad next visit.

There are lots of great options for Gluten Free and Vegetarian visitors as well, although neither of us went with those options.
