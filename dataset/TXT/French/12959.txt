4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Came here for the first time. I never eat French food at all, but what a treat!!   Wifey and I got their carafe sangria to start the dinner off.  The sangria had lot of fruits and was really smooth and tasty. Then I got the endive salad with tasty caramelized walnuts.  This was such an amazing salad and it was huge.  Then for the main course I got their Classique steak.  When the steak came out the meat was so soft and tender.  It literally melted in my mouth.  Now I know why this place has over 7,000 reviews because it's out of this world. And the prices for being French food and located in Vegas- super reasonable!!!!!!   Then off to dessert of course.  We got the banana bread pudding.   There was nothing left of that at the end of our meal.    It wasn't overly sweet either.   It was just right, fluffy, warm, and moist.  I will be back to try their breakfast and dinner again .   BTW, the service, was just as great .
