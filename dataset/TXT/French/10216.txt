4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We came here for a bachelorette party brunch and had high hopes for this place. We mainly focused on the seafood section and was left disappointed. 

*Food*
- Escargot: so savory and went perfectly with the bread they provided!

- Eggs Benedict: I was a little disappointed with this dish, the ones I had back home at a diner was better. Portion size was small, just an egg over a sad soggy English muffin. 

- Baked Scallop: 3 scallops baked to perfection and the sauce went perfect with the bread.

- Seafood Crepe: another disappointing dish, nothing to break the seafood and creme combination, so you get tired of the taste after 5 bites. 

- Mussels: DO NO ORDER. They were NOT fresh mussels. We even told the waitress about it and she said the they have fresh ones daily. Not true, 1 taste and you know it has been sitting there for days.

We had some amazing seafood the day before at L'Atelier de Bouchon where we felt like we were eating right out of the ocean, but the mussels we had felt like they got them from the gutter. Disappointing way to end our meal. 

* Service *
- Our waitress was polite enough, although her demeanor did not seem genuine. Overall it was fine, we got our bread and water fast enough.
