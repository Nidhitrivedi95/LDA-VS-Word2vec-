rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I seriously need to thank this place for providing such stellar service. After a nightmarish meal at an Italian restaurant in the Miracle Mile, I was thrilled to come here and feel more welcomed. *high five*
Bouchon has never disappointed me. This is only for brunch though, I can't say anything for lunch or dinner. I've tasted the pomme frites, chicken and waffles, croque madame, profiteroles, brioche and jam and hibiscus drink. 
The pomme frites are crisp to perfection. The bread on the croque is nicely toasted and tastes wonderful with the gooey runny egg- however, I prefer mine with a fully cooked egg. The chicken and waffles are probably my favorite. Compared to Roscoe's, it's a different experience all together. You don't have to use the syrup because the waffle has this nutty flavor alone. Topped with a piece of chicken and a smear of butter and you're good to go! The chicken is beautifully fried with all the flavors coming from the meat itself, not the batter. 
I love bread and Bouchon has the BEST bread and vanilla bean butter on earth!!!! Everything is better with butter- lemme tell you! Just remember that the vanilla bean butter only comes with the Chicken & Waffles dish and may cost extra if you order it alone. Also get the profiteroles which are tiny fried pieces of dough (fancy donuts if you will).
