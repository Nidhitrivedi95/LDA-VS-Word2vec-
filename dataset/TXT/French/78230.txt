YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g The food was so delicious! I was a with a large group and we ordered most of the menu. The portions were small, so I didn't get to try everything, but I found all the food to be wonderful! The tuna tacos, osso bucco, and duck confit stick out in my mind as the best dishes. I loved the sauce injection with the duck!

It's overpriced, but so is the rest of Vegas, so make sure you go after a large slot machine win.
