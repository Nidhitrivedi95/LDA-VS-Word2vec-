q0n4I-zqiI47xispOqc1lA I came here for the french toast, but it was the "cherry" egg white omelet that I devoured. The omelet and coffee are fantastic, the french toast, not so much! I ordered the berry french toast topped with goat cheese and whatever the berry sauce that was concocted to top the french toast was awful to me, it tasted like artificial science. Additionally, I don't like french toast that's topped with fried egg, I prefer dipped in batter french toast. The waitress was very pleasant and dutiful. Before I conclude, allow me to share an oddity, the waitress unprompted brought us two small bottled waters, and to our surprise, a cost for the same appeared on the bill. I would return because I love small businesses, and the coffee and omelet were great!
