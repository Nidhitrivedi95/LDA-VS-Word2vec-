2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ Based off the reviews, we thought it would be amazing, but we were sadly disappointed. We ordered to-go, and maybe it affected the flavor, but it was super bland and in all honesty, made me feel nauseous. I ended up only eating the mushrooms and chicken from the "Matt", but even then it still wasn't good. We walked in on a weekday afternoon and there was no one there. We were able to get our food quickly and leave and the aesthetics were very pleasing, but it just wasn't what I was hoping for. Very disappointed. :(
