AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw We arrived for our breakfast reservation 5 minutes early. They did not seat us until 20 minutes later after I raised a stink that we were going to be late for our meeting after breakfast. The hostess said they were seating people who did not have reservations as well. The service was good once we were seated. 

The continental buffet was $22 not including espresso drinks. The croissants are to die for and the fruit cups were very good. Good atmosphere. My espresso macchiato  was sub-standard with airy foam.
