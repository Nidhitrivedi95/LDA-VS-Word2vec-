10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA Stopped into Bivy for a weekend dinner, and was adequately happy with the results. The interior is pretty much on par with most of the other restaurants that have popped up in this area in the last couple years, with reclaimed wood interiors with small candlelit tables. 

We started with the charcuterie and spicy devilled eggs to start. Both were tasty and appropriately priced, but the devilled eggs were admittedly not actually spicy. Still tasty, but adding a dusting of paprika is hardly spicy to me. Then as a second course we split an order of ribs, which were decent, but a little to overpowering in the citrus based acidity. 
As a main, I rounded out my meal with the pulled pork sandwich with fries. The pulled pork was admittedly less acidic than the ribs and more savoury. The spinach in the sandwich was a nice addition but the tomato and mayo just made me realize the flavor of the pork isn't impressive enough if relying on additional sauces and juicy vegetables to affect its flavouring. 

In the end for 4 beers, the 2 apps, an order of ribs and 2 mains came in a bit over $100 after tax and tip. So for what we turned into a 3 course meal, was perfectly adequate in price and results. I'll come back, but admittedly there are a few other joints in the neighbourhood which have priority in my dining agenda.
