mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Fancy food minus the full-on pretentious environment....

I had the $155 discovery prix fix, which came out to about $200 without wine.  For $200, I actually prefer the pretentious environment.  For that kind of money, homeboy in the tux should be coming by after every course and scoop bread crumbs off the table with his bread-crumb-scraper.  But no...the environment was very informal...there was no scoopage of bread crumbs.  

BREAD
It comes out in a pretty assortment.  Careful when you bite into it...the only thing harder and colder is the butter that comes out with it.  

PORTIONS
Portions are hilariously small.  I searched for hidden cameras expecting my boy Joel to pop out from behind the counter and tell me I've been punkd....and then proceed to give me the rest of my food.  Joel was not to be found, and neither was the rest of my food - the food I paid 200 fucking dollars for.  

My friend, 5'0, 95 lbs with a tiny appetite said she was at 60% capacity at the end of the meal.  Do the math.

COURSES
Each course got progressively better and I can now say I've had easily the best lamb of my life.  It came in two medallions served with a potato puree, some greens, and roasted garlic.  The meat was not gamey at all and melted in my mouth.  

CHICKEN TERIYAKI?
I thought it would be worth mentioning that they had chicken teriyaki as one of the choices for main course on a prix fix.  That's right folks...chicken fuckin teriyaki.  For this price range, Mr. Teriyaki himself better have prepared the dish.  And it better be fed to me by two hot geishas.  Just sayin.
