D7CnTsm8SCmbQghz1ioPdw My wife and I were in Montreal for one night only, and we could not possibly have picked a better place for our only dinner in town. From the moment we walked down the stairs and experienced the inviting scent of cedar(?), we knew were were in for a awesome experience. The ambience is classy but comfortable, and the service was top-notch. We especially appreciated chatting with the sommelier about her recommendations, which of course were excellent.

Overall, the drinks, food, and service were all top-notch, and well worth the price. (I've paid more for worse in all three areas.) Steak tartare and a venison chop were personal highlights, but everything we ordered was fantastic. My only regret is that we can't go again until we find ourselves in the city again.
