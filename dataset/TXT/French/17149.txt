9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg Well this was a bit of a disappointment. Went here for summerlicious, as we had been meaning to try it out....  It is just bland and boring.  The service is very attentive, which is nice. The food is well cooked, for sure...but just uninspired. I started with Feuillete d'Escargot, and had Blanquette de Volaille as main: juicy, perfectly done, but....  There are so many interesting things to taste in Toronto these days, to me it just isn't worth spending the money and time at Cafe Boulud.  The atmosphere is nice but feels very cafeteria-like.....I used to love the old Four Seasons, had so much atmosphere....the new location just falls flat for me.
