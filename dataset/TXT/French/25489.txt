Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Have been here half a dozen times.  Great place for a quieter dinner.  Most places around Vegas feel like a night club so this is a reliable place where you can take your time eating in a relatively quiet ambiance with a good view.  I haven't had any standout dishes although everything I have had is prepared well and in some cases, interesting.  The desserts are where this place fails.  Not terrible but definitely underwhelming.  The big problem with the desserts is when they are good there just isn't much.
