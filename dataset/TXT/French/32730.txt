h_ypoQ2rmwX8UGSmohsGiQ usually have their famous chocolate chip cookie. this cookie. with it's nutty, soft, chocolately goodness is one of the best cookies i've ever had.

SERVICE here is quite awful. unattentive, indifferent staff. they do not pay attention to incoming customers, and usually have their backs to the front, while doing their prep. service is long and slow, and not a place to go to when in a rush. the food and treats are great. the staff there from the cash/barista/to the smug owners/management, keep me from returning. they need to focus a lot more on their customer service.
