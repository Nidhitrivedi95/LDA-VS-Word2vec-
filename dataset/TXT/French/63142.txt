SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA My husband and I celebrate our anniversary here almost every year. It's one our favorite spots. The entrees are always delicious- French comfort food, cocktails and the escargot is to die for!! I got the starry night cocktail and it was amazing!! The prices are super reasonable- we got cocktails, split a salad, each got entrees and split dessert...100 dollars even.
