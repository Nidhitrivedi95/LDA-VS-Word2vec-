rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I went to Bouchon this past weekend for dinner with family. I wasn't pleased when I went a few years ago but decided to give it another shot. Boy, am I glad I did. It  was definitely much better the second time around. 
We had a party of 11 and had a great time! The service was friendly and the waiter was knowledgeable. He went over the restaurant's history along with some details and facts about Thomas Keller the chef. It was great that he took the time to explain everything to us. He also went over the specials in detail.
The best entrees would have to be the Mussels with fries and the Steak frites were pretty darn good with the butter on top. Their foie gras could have been better but the portion was definitely friendly. For dessert I had the Coffee custard which was superb! The custard melted in my mouth!
The prices for everything were decent  for the entire dining experience.  Including wine, our bill was not outrageous.
