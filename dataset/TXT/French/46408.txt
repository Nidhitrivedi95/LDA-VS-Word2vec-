nhl7ZnypDgDESAedF2O6ZQ Went to Jonathans for our wedding anniversary.
The place seems like having dinner at a living room of somebody's house.
The interior is very nice and it has a very cozy and comfy feel to it which I liked a lot.
The waiters were very nice and courteous too.

We ordered grilled calamari and cauliflower almond soup for appetizers.
Guys!!!!!Like seriously you have to try this cauliflower almond soup.It legit HEAVEN.
For main course,we ordered goat cheese salad and seafood linguine which were delicious too but nothing extraordinary.There was lot of seafood in linguine which I appreciate.

Everything is very pricey though and no main course food item is below 25 dollars.
The appetizers all also all above 12 dollars.
For dessert,we ordered the gluten free chocolate cake which was amazzzzzzing but again very pricey like 17 dollars or something.

Overall, a very pleasant experience and I highly recommend everyone to try it on some special occasion. Definitely not a place where you would go often.
