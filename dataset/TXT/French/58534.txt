RfsMUrGUJdrpfrU54rmEsQ The food and service was amazing!! We highly recommend the Caprese salad and the fried Swiss cheese for appetizers, which was so delicious!! Amber was our server and she was so wonderful! Highly recommend this place. There was live music while we all sat outside on the patio enjoying our drinks and food. We all will be back!!
