4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Eat at Mon Ami Gabi at your own risk- it will ruin you for every other high-end restaurant in Vegas. From the food quality and preparation to the service to lovely wine list to the extremely reasonable prices, everything here is extraordinary. In our three days in vegas we ate here twice. 

The patio is great if you want to watch the fountains, but we enjoyed the inside just as much.
