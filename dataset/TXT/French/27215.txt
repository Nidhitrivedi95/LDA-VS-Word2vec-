dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg Since I heard this place is one of the best french place in town, i decided to give it a try.

Environment /Service
--Restaurant looks amazing from the outside. However, inside decroation is kind of disappointing. It is very old country style like you are eating at your grandma's old house. The table cloth colour theme and the chair made the resturant looks very cheap and sketchy. You would not expect the menu is this expensive when you look inside the restaurant. I think that's why most people walk by and look at the menu and then just walk away.
-Service is nice. Waitress does know their food and menu and provide some valuable suggestion

Food:
--mussules (3/5) . 
The sauce of the day is coconut curry.It is a very unique sauce and i do think it's worthy of trying. However, the mussuls and sauce was not hot enough. The dish was warm, which made it less enjoyable. If it were hot enough, i believe you could smell and taste the sauce better. 

--Escargot (2/5).
 Escargot is very different than other french restaurant. It was not baked. It is more like fried escargot with mushroom. Again, the dish was warm and didnt look like freshly cooked at all. I was very upset about this dish since i LOVE escargot

--Grilled horse meat and venison (4/5)
The meat were cooked perfectly. When waitress informed me they cooked them rare, I were a little bit worried. However, it turned out to be perfect. You can feel that the meat is melting into your mouse. If you want to try something different, definitely order this dish. I have nothing to complain about it. 

--duck neck sausage (3.5/5)
The meat and testure were great. Howeve, I don't like the puree because  It was sweet. It was a light dish and suitable for summer. I just disliked the sweet flavour in the dish in general.

We didnt order any alcohol and the bills is around $120. 
The price is okay in terms of the french food. However, i dont think i would go back again if i get to choose the resturant.
