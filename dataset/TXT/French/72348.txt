XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q I've been waiting a long time to have the opportunity to dine at J.R. I am highly critical when it comes to dining at this level  simply because unparalleled service, food and ambiance must be delivered when you are spending over $800 a couple for dinner. The experience at J.R met every expectation I had and more. 

I can go into a long dissertation about every aspect of the meal but I'll save you the time by simply saying that if you are a food & wine enthusiast you will be in heaven from start to finish. 

On another note, you got to love yelp because everyone gets a chance to spew their two cents. Reading a 1-star review by Bin Z is laughable and just shows you that not everything is for everyone. Some folks should stick to the Cheesecake factory for their special dining experience...
