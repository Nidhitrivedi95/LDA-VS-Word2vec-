The soup of the day (clam chowder) was ok, resembles more of a stew than a soup, and it doesn't have the sweet taste of fresh seafood. Think they could do better.

The Scottish Salmon was heavenly. I was debating with that and the burger, but would definitely order it again. It has all the rich taste of the salmon, but no that heavy feeling. It also started my liking for polenta!

Ordered the apple tarte tatin, it was below average. Next time, I'm trying another dessert.

Food is good but not outstanding. The decor and service, however, are terrific!
