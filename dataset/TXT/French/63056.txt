SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA My girlfriend and I both feel that this is our favorite restaurant that Cleveland has to offer. The food is unique and exquisitely delicious. The service is always superb. Best of all, the prices are reasonable. I recommend the cheese platter. They bring a large selection with a variety of cheeses. The portions are generous and the staff is knowledgeable of every cheese offered.
