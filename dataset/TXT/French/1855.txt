Before I delve into the food, let's talk abt the hood. Located in the newly gentrified section of St Henri, the street it's on boasts a number of quaint restaurants, trendy shops and hipster bars. 

Our reservation was at 6:45 and when we arrived there were still a good number of unfilled seats. The crowd consisted of businessmen expensing the meal, locals and tourists alike. We were lucky enough to get seated at a four top in front of the chalkboard menu--lucky for us since there are no printed menus, the lighting is dim and my husband forgot his glasses. If you're somewhat unfamiliar w French use Google Translate, or even better just ask the waitstaff. Our server was polite and uber helpful as we apologized profusely for not speaking the native tongue.

Undecisive, we went the tapas route (these are not tapas though, they're full-size). We started w a dozen PEI oysters, which were meticulously prepared and the freshest I've ever had. We also tried the beer cheese -- which I should've loved in theory bc I really enjoy each separately, but I just found it ok. The final app was the pork rilette, which I secretly didn't want to share.

We followed it up with 3 entrees; beef cheek, which was beautifully tender, seared scallops and the most popular dish on the menu, lobster spaghetti in a light cream sauce. Sounds pretty simple, but if it ain't broke... Us broads, ever up for something sweet opted for the chocolate mousse. I typically opt for vanilla or nutty desserts, but this rocked. Light and airy topped w fresh whip cream, I ate most of it.
