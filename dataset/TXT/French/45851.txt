mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q WOW!!! One of the best meal I have ever had.

The atmosphere is wonderful. Usually I hate black and red but they decorated the restaurant very tastefully. I also really liked that they have counter seating so you can see how your food is prepared. It also assured me that my food was being handled correctly. By far one of the cleanest kitchens I have ever seen. Also it assured you that they have nothing shady to hide. Plus: got to see a short French man with an angry face (aka executive chef) with his arms cross barking out orders in French. PRICELESS

As for the food. L'Atelier is by far my favorite restaurant in Vegas. You get to have the wonderful Joel Robuchon food without the over the top 3 hour dinner. I had the Foie Gras Burger and the Quail Stuffed with Foie Gras. Both were to die for. The burger was perfectly cooked and the foie gras did not overpower the meat. It was perfectly prepared. As for the quail, it was just pure PERFECTION!!! The quail was cooked perfectly and the foie gras once again highlighted the meat. I would highly recommend both.

note: If your meal does not come with the mashed potatoes ORDER IT!!!!!!! The best mashed potatoes ever!!!!!!!!!! TRUST ME!!!!! They are creamy and cheesy but not too heavy. Really hard to explain, It was just flat out delicious!!! My view of the mundane side dish has completely changed. I can not longer looked at mashed potatoes the same way anymore. 

dessert: The Raspberry Surprise was awesome!!! The tanginess of the yuzu ice cream and the raspberry sauce totally complimented the creaminess and the sweetness of the white chocolate sphere. It was well prepared and executed perfectly. When it comes to fine dining it all comes down to the execution. You can be as creative all you want, but if that sh*t doesn't come out right, then that is an automatic FAIL!!!! 

When in Vegas eat at L'Atelier, don't be a pansy!
