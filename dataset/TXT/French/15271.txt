6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q The cashier was very rude.  Keep asking to repeat my name then she shove the receipt & a pen toward me so I could write my name.  I just use Sofie as it was as easy name to use.  The person making the crepe was even worst.  She seem to throw thing every where & the crepe look very sloppy but it look nice once she add the wipe cream & chocolate syrup (I think that was the only good thing that came out of it).  When I eat it, it was not good at all.  It did not taste sweet at all & the strawberry was ver sour. I don't think I would come here again. Just hope that they would train service better.
