ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig Food was all pretty good - liked the soups bread and Anna's bolognese. The salads were overdressed and sparring on the good advertised ingredients. Would give a solid 4 on the food alone (minus fly in my green tea) but the service was so bad it looses 2 full stars. Almost 2 hours for lunch - may be my east coast sense of urgency but this was really ridiculous - no bread until  we insisted - general avoidance altogether
