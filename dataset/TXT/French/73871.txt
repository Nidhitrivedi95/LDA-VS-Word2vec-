xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I went there recently with Mom and Dad....The server was mediocre in the start...then just got worse from there....My blue cheese soufflé was cold, and the foie gras was okay....both a disappointment. The chocolate souffle came with no whip cream - a real shocker....Views to die for though!!
