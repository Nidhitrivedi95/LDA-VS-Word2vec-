58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw Went here for brunch during my stay in Montreal and was very pleased. It had the perfect ambience for a brunch spot and the food was tasty! Prices were reasonable. Got one of the brunch meals and was pleasantly surprised by the portion size. Although it was a bit much for me, it was a wonderful size for my boyfriend. We topped our brunch off with a lovely dessert, a tasty croissant with chocolate inside. Loved it! Also, the mimosa (which was an add on) was nice and potent, just the way I like it.
