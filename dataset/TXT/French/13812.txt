50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw Walked by Biff's on a lovely evening and saw the sign out front advertising $! oysters and couldn't resist sitting outside and enjoying a nice cold Kronenbourg and some oysters.  The oysters had a very nice flavour.  

We also tried the escargots with gnocchi, bacon and smoked beurre blanc, which were very good, also had the steak tartare, which was good but slightly under-seasoned, at least for my tastes, the braised beef cheek and bone marrow was delicious as was the as was the foie gras du jour, a foie gras parfait with candied peaches.  

Service was great, beautiful spot to sit outside, food was very good and the price is quite reasonable.  Will definitely be coming back again soon to try a few more items on the menu that we wanted to try but didn't have room for.
