D7CnTsm8SCmbQghz1ioPdw Perhaps I was unlucky, but what happened to me should not happen when your bill for two people is over 100 dollars.

The menu is small and quite fatty. I saw a fish item that was supposed to be served with "eggplant sauce on top of tumeric pita and with israeli salad". After a long wait, the waiter informed us that they burned the pita and had to remake it, and assured me "it will be worth the wait". When it finally arrived, the pita was again dry and simply awful, the eggplant sauce was nothing but bagabanoush, and israeli salad was tabuleh. Except for the fish fillet, which was simple but nice, you can get the rest much much tastier at any middle-eastern street vendor! For much less than $30!!! The waiter was nice and tried to make up by offering free desert and a drink for me (sadly i do not drink :-\).

My partners dish was a pork chop, and it was tasty but extremely fatty, like the rest of the main dishes on the menu. We ordered the free desert that was supposed to be whiskey-soaked cake. The cake was tasty, but they had covered the whole thing with a massive amount of whipped cream, so we could barely get to the cake. Everything else on the desert menu was also extremely heavy so we could not find anything.

Overall, the menu is limited, the service slow, and the food not that good. Simply not worth the money.
