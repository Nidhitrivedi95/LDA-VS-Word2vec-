pmrHuQiy25xKB86tbOLBlA One of my most favorite places to dine.  Went with a friend during the Queen's Feast, 2017 and my plate almost looked like I had licked it clean.  I had been one time before and the same thing happened. LOL   We had our favorite server, Brenda,  and she was as charming as ever.  I had the scallops over rissotto and they were excellent. The roasted beet salad was also delicious.  My birthday is coming up in a few months, so hoping someone wants to take me to dinner  here.  I highly recommend this little French restaurant.  I love it.
