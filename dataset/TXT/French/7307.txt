4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This was my first time in Vegas and I didn't know a good place to get some nice breakfast. Me and my boyfriend were walking looking at our phones (yelp) to see if there was anything nice. Mon Ami Gabi popped up.

What a pleasant surprise!! It's not usual for me, traveling, to like the first place I go to eat. Most because you simply don't know the place and have no idea what you may get. But I'm sure we got the best.

My boyfriend got the eggs benedict and pomegranate juice an I got the croissant sandwich. We had a blast, my boyfriend loved his plate and It was definitely one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Super crunchy croissant pastry and super fluffy eggs inside!! Awesome!! 

The service was very nice as well, but you may have some trouble to get a table because at the 2 times we went there, the place was crowded. But I can understand why.
