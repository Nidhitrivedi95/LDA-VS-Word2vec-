mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q I assign 1 star not because the food was terrible (it wasn't) but rather because it was WAY below expectation. My wife & I have dined at other Michelin-star restaurants, and they far exceeded L'Atelier. We both had the tasting menu and, by the time we left, the wine, water and tip inflated the bill to close to $500. Definitely not worth it. The next night we had a far better meal (also a  tasting menu) for $200 at the nearby Shibuya. What was disappointing about L'Atelier? Three of the courses depended on foie gras. Not too imaginative. One of the courses (a small piece of King crab) was good but I honestly believe that we could easily replicate it - or improve upon it - at home (which is NOT something I'd say about any other Michelin dish I have tasted). And half-way through the meal the waiter informed us that he had forgotten to mention that one of the courses - scallops - had been replaced by oysters. When you're paying $300 for food alone, I think it's reasonable to expect to be told ahead of time what you'll be eating! The 2 dessert courses were good. Most certainly would not go back. And because of this experience, nor will we try to dine, in the future, at the partner restaurant (Joel Robuchon at the Mansion).
