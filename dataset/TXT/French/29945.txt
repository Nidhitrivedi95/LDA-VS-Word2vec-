fKDyiIcFLkl-_5d4JsvBXA L'Entrecote Saint-Jean was a very nice establishment to dine in at.  Clean, fancy, elegant with friendly service and an excellent wine selection.  I like the fact that they kept the menu simple when I went with some friends for dinner with three full course selections to choose from.  I ordered the salad with walnuts, steak and fries with a bottle of red house wine and the steak was fantastic.  Next time I come here I will try the soup and if I have room in my stomach get some dessert as well.
