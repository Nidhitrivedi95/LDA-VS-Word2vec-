The complimentary snacks include some incredibly tasty truffle popcorn.  We also ordered the potato crisps, carpaccio and scallops.  All were very good.

The only letdown was the service which really faltered towards the end.  We asked for more snacks while we contemplated dessert and neither the snacks nor the dessert order were forthcoming.  The waitress just sort of disappeared.  Not the end of the world, but a slight disappointment.  I expect we'll give it another try though.
