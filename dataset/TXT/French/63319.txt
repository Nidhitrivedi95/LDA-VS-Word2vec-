SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA I love this place, I can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet!

The food is always spot on, delicious, and it's very reasonably priced!  It's right by us, so super convenient location.  I've been here several times, and I can't even give details of specific dishes because I've had quite a few different things.  But I can say all our selections have been delicious, and we've never left hungry or disappointed.  They have a great wine selection and their cheese platter is quite popular as well.

It's an adorable place, it'd be perfect for a date if you're looking for a date spot.  It's quite romantic!  There's street parking around the area if you look, but if you're lazy, there's a parking lot (I think it costs $3).

Explanation of my rating system -
5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back
4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category
3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either.
2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it.
1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going.
