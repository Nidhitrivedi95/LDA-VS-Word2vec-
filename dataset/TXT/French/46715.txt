nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ Great dining experience...great chef! Chef Vincent is one of the countries best. The escargot is a must and should be shared. The bread is made at the restaurant. He has a 15 year old "starter"..have your waiter explain. Great bread! The salads are a must and can be shared.
We had the Hanger Steak and is one of his specialties. It's would be hard to find a steakhouse that serves a more tender cut of meat. The wine stressed will help you find an affordable match. Try it...you'll be pleased.
