XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w Not impressed, especially at the prices they charge. I ordered a house salad and French onion soup. The house salad was only lettuce with tasteless dressing. Seriously? What about carrots, tomatoes or anything else with flavor? Just lettuce? Come on.

I watched my French onion soup sit for about 5 minutes before it was brought to me. By then it wasn't even warm. The cheese on top was only warm. Not good!

The service was fine and creme brûlée was decent, although it was runny. 

Even though this place is in an airport, food should be better.
