This place was a bit hard to find, but definitely worth the time finding this for everyone plan on visiting Las Vegas and wants to avoid those overcrowded and overcharging french restaurants on the Strip.

Best time to go would be an hour before sunset and reserve an outdoor lakeview table. Also if you want their best dessert, order 30 minutes ahead.
