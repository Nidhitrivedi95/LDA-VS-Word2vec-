USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg A great restaurant needs to balance the three legged stool of Food, Atmosphere, and Service and The Fig Tree accomplishes all three. We've lived all over the US and have been to many outstanding restaurants, this is one of them. 

The food was excellent, the atmosphere very cozy, and the service excellent. 

I took my wife there for her birthday and it was romantic. And, unlike many restaurants in LA, New York, Paris where the tables are inches from each other, we had a very private table and could talk freely. 

Also reasonable price for the quality. 

Highly recommended.
