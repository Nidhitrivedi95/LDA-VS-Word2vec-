qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw Prior to the visit, I went through the LV Michelin Guide to see if there are any semi casual places that would be a good dinner restaurant.  After reading reviews from fellow Yelpers, I decided on Daniel Boulud inside the Wynn Hotel and happy to say that I wasn't disappointed.

Reservation was made for 6:30pm (so K and I could make The Beatles Love Cirque du Soleil show).  We were greeted promptly but the maitre d wasn't particularly warm or friendly.  We had the option of inside or garden seating and we chose the garden which I *highly* recommend (I will explain in a second).

Our waiter was friendly and came by to take our drink orders quickly.  We chose the Caesar salad and escargots as starters to share.  The Caesar salad was great but the escargots were excellent.  We decided to share the main entrees as well and chose the steamed mussels and roasted chicken.  The steamed mussels were good but nothing out of this world (Cafe Torre is still my favorite, followed closely by Hawg's); the roasted chicken was tasty and tender.

For dessert, we shared rocky road ice cream and passion fruit sorbet.  Standard fare - good stuff.

The best part, however, was definitely the outside entertainment.  The garden seating is right next to a giant pool which has a towering wall with waterfall.  Every half an hour, the wall turns into an entertainment display (you will have to see it -  I don't want to ruin it for you).  It was pretty cool.

The service started out nice but deteriorated as the evening went on.  By the end, after we finished our dessert, it must have been 30 or 45 minutes before the waiter dropped off our check.  I suppose it did give us a chance to enjoy the evening...
