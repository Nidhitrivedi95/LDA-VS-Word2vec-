Luckily, it's pretty close to my work so the husband and I had to check it out. It's in a shopping center near a Pei Wei, which is sort of a turn off, but that doesn't detract from the food. The husband ordered the Chez-vous, which had roasted chicken, sautéed mushrooms, and béchamel sauce while I ordered the Brittany (chicken, tomato, caramelized onions, and crème fraiche). Both came with a side salad, which had a very good dressing. I wasn't expecting the crepe to be an organic buckwheat crepe, but it was delicious! Afterwards, we split the Exotic crepe - shredded coconut, melted dark chocolate, and bananas. I'm a sucker for anything coconut, so let's just say it was amazing. I can't wait to come back!
