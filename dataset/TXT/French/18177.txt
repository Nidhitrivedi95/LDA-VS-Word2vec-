A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I can literally not drive past this place and not go in.    The lunch deals are reasonably priced and taste awesome.  I especially enjoy the Salted Caramel tarte, the Chocolate Truffle cake.  The macrons.  The flan.  The baguettes.  The Beef bourguignon.  The Quiche...  on and on.  The hot food is top notch.  The baked goods are off the chart.
