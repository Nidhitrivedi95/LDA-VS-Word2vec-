1ThbwFVBL9YA2oOM11iO7g They have duck on the menu!  If there's duck at a restaurant, I must try it, and here, I'm super glad that I did!  This is a low key, dark restaurant with some seriously tasty food.  I came here with Catherine L for the Telus Tuesday Special, which by the way, was an amazing deal.  

We started with the oysters and charcuterie plate.  Delicious!  The oysters were so fresh and the charcuterie was the right amount of saltiness and quantity to make for a light and appealing appetizer.  

The aforementioned duck was crispy, juicy and all round awesome.  The black cod with mussels was meaty and perfectly done.  

For dessert, we both had the creme brulee which tasted like it should.

If it wasn't for the deal, the bill would have added up quite a bit.  Also, it's not the place for big eaters to come and expect to be full.  I was pretty satisfied, but I know bigger eaters than me certainly wouldn't be with our choice of the menu.

The service was good.  The bathroom is located down a steep flight of stairs with single self-contained stalls.  The restaurant is bigger than it looks on the outside because there's an entire back area that is separated from the front of the restaurant by the kitchen.

The only complaint I have really had nothing to do with the restaurant, rather the difficulty I had getting here via public transportation.  The Queen Street West streetcar is notoriously unreliable.  On the way back, we waited over half an hour  even though the ttc text system said it would take 10 minutes.  A better alternative is to take the Ossington Bus which starts at the Ossington Subway Station and goes through to Liberty Village and back.
