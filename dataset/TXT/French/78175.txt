YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g I've eaten here twice, both times I ordered his specialty foie gra which was melt in your mouth delish! 
What I like about this place is it's so quiet, I don't like noisy places, I can enjoy my high end food without all the noise. It's cozy, not really busy, so the waiters are very good about refills and if you have questions. The tables are spaced far apart so there's some privacy too.
I've also had the Filet Mignon, which was very tender and juicy. Cooked medium rare the way I like it!
Also had the Braised Waygu Short ribs, I enjoyed this dish as well. It was very flavorful and seasoned well.
I suggest getting a groupon or something, spend $75 and get $125 worth of high end cuisine.
