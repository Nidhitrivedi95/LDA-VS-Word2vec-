hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Baguette Cafe is great! Perfect for a lunch w friends/family or during the work week! I am here on lunch from work. The service is quick- very friendly, nice & informative staff behind the counter/register. It's super clean & well kept. Cute interior/ambiance. Cafe style. They serve illy espresso products. I'd totally have one but I drank a ton of coffee this morning and at work!  It's a hidden gem for sure. Its not super packed which is nice. Two girls meeting here for lunch and one said "I didn't even know this was here..."
It could use a little more seating inside. But it is small so it would be a little packed. Although it's cute it could use a fresh coat of paint, revamped art and more of it & new flooring.$14 something before tip. Sandwich is $8. Got a soup & bag of chips too.
