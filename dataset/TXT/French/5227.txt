3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw Breakfast is pretty good here... Not fantastic. Service tends to be a little on the slow slide. However, the $5 mimosas are so good. Would I say it's my favorite breakfast place in Vegas? No. But it's worth a try. They have a few items on the menu that are worth coming back for.
