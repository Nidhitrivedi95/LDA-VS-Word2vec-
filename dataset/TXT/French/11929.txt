4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Nom nom nom. Mon Ami Gabi offered awesome hangover food. :) The Blueberry French Toast and Smoked Salmon Hors D'oeuvres...woah. The former was bursting with fruitiness, not only through the topped blueberries but with the blueberry syrup. The latter was creamy and tender. It was a bit overkill with all the complimentary bread preceding our selections (more self-control) but I'd recommend both. The Fresh Toast was definitely the best I've had. The outdoor patio was a treat. People watching on the Strip always entertains (and the heat lamps are a great backup!).
