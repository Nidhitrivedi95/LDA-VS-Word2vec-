FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg This place looks very nice. But far from cozy and ambient atmosphere... more like a place you take your sorority party to eat and drunk.  Loud. My grilled tilapia was nothing but salt. Placed on top of rice which I hardly tasted underneath all the spices.  Thank god the service is great, so water was refilled at all times!  Would I come back??? I didn't hate the place, but unlikely.
