FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg A great restaurant! I met some friends here last night and we had a wonderful meal. Not very expensive for the quality of food they're serving and totally delicious. Their boeuf bourginon is not actually a bourgignon, but rather a slow cooked beef cheek served with potatoes. That being said, it's still delicious. The service is great although the ambiance is a bit noisy.  Try the hanger steak with the chocolate cream for dessert! mmmm! :) Oh and one more thing, this place needs to get faster at giving th bill and taking payment from customers. THere have been a few times where I've seen other tables just get up and leave without paying since the bill took so long to arrive, or others where the waiters take forever to come with the payment machine.
