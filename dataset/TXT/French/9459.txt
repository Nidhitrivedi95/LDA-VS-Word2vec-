I've had Mon Ami Gabi bookmarked for a while now, so I was extremely excited when we finally made plans to dine here on my latest and greatest trip. 

We were looking forward to the famous DIY Bloody Mary bar, but were unsure about how to put a Bloody Mary together. When we asked our server if he had a recipe for us or any recommendations on what to put in the Bloody Mary, he was extremely sassy and unhelpful. When the food arrived, we noticed that there was an extra order that wasn't for our table. Again, he was extremely sassy and kept insisting that someone in our party ordered it. If someone did order it, I'm not sure why we would be refusing it! 

Luckily, their delicious food kept this experience mostly positive. I had the ham and cheese crepe and the orange chocolate chip muffin. Both were absolutely delish and I even took half of my muffin to-go for the plane ride home.
