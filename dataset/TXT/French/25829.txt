Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA We got to Mix a bit late and when we tried to get in the lady at the door said it was last call. So we said ok, we'll get a drink and leave. She said no, and that it had already been called. We politely asked if we could just go up and check out the view as we had heard so much about it. Then she just stood up and yelled, "I said no!!! We are closed and you are not getting in."
