SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA I have been here twice and this rating is an average of both times. (the first time was 5 stars and the second 3 stars). The service was top notch both times, but my wife's steak was charred to bitterness on the second visit. She ordered it Medium Rare and to the chef's credit is did come out Medium Rare, which is no small thing. The way the chef got there however, was to use a very hot sear on the surface of the meat which I suppose is an accepted way to do it, but for it left too much char on the meet for our taste, every bite that included the outside of the steak was bitter. The server said it was supposed to be that way, so we didn't press it but in hindsight we should have sent it back. So the issue was It was our fault for not returning something we didn't like.
