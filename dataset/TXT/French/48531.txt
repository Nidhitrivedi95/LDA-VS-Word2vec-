ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig Perhaps they should they call it "Cafe Salt".  I enjoyed my cup of cream of mushroom soup and my entree, beef tips. But their homemade bread was very salty (who does that?). The bread would have been great if they just left the salt shaker on the counter.  Then there was my wife's garden salad with salmon.  A bowl of salt.  She had to send it back for a salt-free (read normal) salad. But the overly salted salmon was still on board.  However the figs that were supposed to be in her salad bowl had apparently fallen overboard in the salt exchange. All that was left was a big bowl of lettuce. 

In the end, this dinning experience just wasn't satisfying.
