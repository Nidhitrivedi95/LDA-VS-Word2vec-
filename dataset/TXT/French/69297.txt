W6D2egUbZzkMtVfR_wf3QQ We went to the Bistro not knowing it had recently been renovated by new owners (Dec 2016).  Outstanding ambience and our server, Troy, was courteous, knowledgeable and attentive. Excellent wine list, reasonably priced.  Our calamari app was delicious and perfectly prepared with a light breaded coating. Our burger and Caesar salad also were delicious. If you haven't been there lately, highly recommend you do so soon. You will be pleasantly surprised!
