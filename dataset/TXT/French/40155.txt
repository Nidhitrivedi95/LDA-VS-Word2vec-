KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA We dined at Marche Bacchus last week.  The hostess was very gracious and seated us on the lake as we requested.  The ambience is lovely;  They have a great wine store leading into the restaurant too.  Our waiter, Vincent, was so nice and accomodating. You should ask for him if you go. We had the truffled mac and cheese, and then their special, halibut with a lemon butter sauce with broccolini,  and for dessert the bread pudding.  Everything was cooked just right and the flavors were not salty or over sauced as is the case in so many restaurants.  The truffled mac and cheese is a must !!!  The absolute best.  You can see the chunks of black truffles throughout the mac. Cannot wait to go again. Kudos to the chef.
