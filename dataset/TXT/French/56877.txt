rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I had breakfast here with my parents last week on a whim that turned out to be the best indecision of the day. We arrived before 8am and the place was already just about full but we were seated immediately. The staff was friendly and attentive and the food was delicious as expected. My Mom ordered the Pre Fixe Breakfast which included a freshly baked pastry, tropical fruit salad, 2 eggs, Lyonnaise potatoes,Sautéed spinach, and coffee for $22 and my Dad and I had the 2 eggs, potato croquettes, and pecan wood smoked bacon for $18...the place was filled with what appeared to be mostly business folks enroute to various meetings or conferences...a very comfortable and relaxed environment surrounded by the beauty of the Venetian decor in the hallways...this Bistro is a little out of the way and not in the main area's of the casino but worth the search.
