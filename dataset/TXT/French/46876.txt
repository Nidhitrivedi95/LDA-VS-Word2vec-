nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ Came here for HH.  Sat at counter area by the open kitchen.  I ordered the cheeseburger and comes with mixed sweet potato & truffle fries.  Then I added petite crispy raviolis.  Everything was so so good and flavorful.  The service was fantastic.  And sitting at the open kitchen, it was neat to see the other dishes and seeing the chefs prep for a large party.
