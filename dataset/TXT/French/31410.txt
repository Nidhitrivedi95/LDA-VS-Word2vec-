gISrxk4A5dfrjDivkC-L-Q My girlfriend and I live the neighborhood and this is our first time here. We should have come here much sooner. 

The staff are all from France and extremely friendly. 

You MUST try the hot chocolate (apparently people wait in line for an hour in Paris for this). You have never had hot chocolate like this. 

They play great French music and have a lot of great packages of pastry to buy for home as well. 

Enjoy 

Highly recommended
