hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Get your head out vegas and dip into a french cafe with decadence you cant believe. Each sandwhich on their menu is prepared with the freshest of breads. While the juices are a little pricey, they are totally worth it. I also thourughly enjoyed the cheesecake. It has its own particular taste i can't describe so try it! I gave this cafe 5 stars because the soothing jazz music in the background, excellent service from the employees, and the deliciousness of the food and drinks. We will be back!
