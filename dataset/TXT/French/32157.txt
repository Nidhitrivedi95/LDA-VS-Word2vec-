gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Amazing dinner experience! The food is great and they have one of the best views of the Las Vegas Strip. 

They have gluten free and vegetarian options. The service was outstanding. 

We made a reservation to celebrate our anniversary and they took care of everything single detail. 

Amazing experience! Highly recommended.
