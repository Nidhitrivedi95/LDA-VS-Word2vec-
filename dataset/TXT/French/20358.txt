aW6Z4NSqEVli-xYMV3jRyg So I'm actually like a 3.7 but Yelp is forcing me to round up.  The thing is, when I know I'm walking into a 3-$ sign restaurant, I'm kinda hoping...and, expecting...to be blown away by every aspect of the night. It makes me feel better about dropping serious cheddar.  

The decor is a little dated and random. It's my expectation of schmanciness that the decor is made to feel that way as well. Our waiter could have been new - he almost seemed nervous, the way he was bumbling through the menu and specials. We also asked him about a few French words on the menu, and what they meant. He didn't know. Umm okay...guess I'll google it!

My 2 friends, husband and I all did the $52 table d'hote. You do actually need to do the math because it's not all a great deal. The scallops as appetizers were superb.  Between the 4 of us, we got the duck, lamb, and trout entrees. PERFECTLY cooked proteins - entrees were absolutely stars of the show. For dessert we got the pistachio dacquoise. It was good, but not great. A tad dry. Husband said vanilla Creme brûlée was good.

One odd snafu- the wrong entrees were put in front of us...and a few minutes later, they took them away and put them in front of other people. Granted, we hadn't yet touched it, and mistakes happen, but not sure how I feel about that.  I guess it's a good thing we weren't sick or sneezy?

All in all, good food, and entrees worth the high dollar...but you can get a more complete fancy restaurant experience elsewhere.
