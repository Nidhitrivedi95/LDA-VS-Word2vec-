The complimentary bread certainly helps fill you up so you don't leave too hungry. However, I was most unimpressed with the McDonald's-esque fries. Also, we had a major service failure. While the staff once we were seated were friendly and accommodating, we had an issue upon arrival. For a 10:45PM reservation on Saturday evening, I called at 10PM the second I landed at LAS to advise we were running just a few minutes behind schedule. The hostess - I believe her name was Amanda - said "I see your name on OpenTable, we'll make a note of it and as long as you're here to be seated by 11PM (when the kitchen closes), you'll be fine. We arrived at 10:58PM on the dot and were rudely told that we missed our reservation and the kitchen was closed. While we waited five minutes for the hostess to check if we can be seated, she returned to tell us a flat out "no." Well, I wasn't born yesterday, I'm not a sucker, and I can handle a Vegas attitude at a trendy/glitzy restaurant. I asked for the manager. Now, at 11:05PM, he comes over, listens to my frustration, and say's "Ah, yes but it is now after 11PM". Are you kidding me?! Dude, we were here before 11PM, and it took over 7 minutes to first get a rude "no" and then for you to come to the front. Suffice it to say, he did invite us in to be seated at the bar. Funny thing? We were actually out of there before the majority of the other people dining.
