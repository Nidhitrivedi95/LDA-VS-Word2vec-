mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog I dined here with some friends about a year ago. Did not plan to write a review because, as it was my first time trying a tasting menu, I thought it satisfied all the expectations I had: innovative & delicious dishes with top notch service. But alas, I recently had my 2nd tasting menu at another establishment and it disappointed to the point I felt compelled to join the yelp community and put in my two cents.

I don't remember the dishes I had here with detail but they were incredibly delicious! I just remembered the first dish: corned mousse because I never heard or tried anything quite like it... and ditto for all subsequent dishes except for the classic staples like foie gras terrine and lamb. The dishes were also well paced, so expect a good 3 hrs here. I would definitely go back if I happen to be in Montreal again.
