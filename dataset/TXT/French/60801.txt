SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg Good in terms of food, with very good bread and croissants. Gives a nice, authentic french feel. However, the service was sub-par 3 times I've been there (pretty unpleasant an un-friendly waiting staff - partially understandable due to the amount of work and customers), and wait times have ben of at least 20-30 mins each.
