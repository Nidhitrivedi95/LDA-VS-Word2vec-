xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q Smoked Nemo ($11.99 + tax) with smoked salmon, avocado, spinach, Olives, onions, cream cheese. Pleasantly crunchy and full of flavour. Balances really well and none of the ingredients are overwhelming. Really creamy flavour and had a bit of a kick. 

Philly cheese steak ($9.99+ tax) with roast beef, green peppers, onions, mushrooms, arugula, cheddar. Don't let the name decide you however, they actually use ROADT BEEF instead of STEAK. Still works really well together  with the BBQ sauce adding a nice flavour to it, I would recommend the Nemo over this however.

Costa Rican Sugar Cane Juice ($5.99+tax). You can add different flavours on top for +$1. Pretty sweet but also very refreshing. Feels like it's freshly made and was quite thirst quenching.

ASK FOR DRIED CRICKETS to add to your crepe. They're not too flavourful but adds a nice crunch to each bite. They tastes just like sunflower seeds!

Restaurant is a really cozy with nice environment that adds to the experience. Whole store fits around 14 people but it was pretty empty when I was here. Closes really late and the staff was really friendly. Service was fast and food was freshly made in front of us. I'm literally watching her cut my apple right now! 

Overall, on the pricier end came to a total of ~$20.
