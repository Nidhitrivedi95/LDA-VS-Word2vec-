nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ Used to to go to Christopher's old location and loved it but I must say that his new restaurant is more modern and hip.  I feel like I am in a restaurant in New York.  Their happy hour is the best deal in town.  From 3-6pm 7 days a week you can enjoy fantastic food for 50% off as well as 50% off all wines they carry by the glass but you should get there early because many times it is hard to get a seat! Service is efficient and friendly. Also check out their Stimulus wine list!
