sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g I I had the pleasure of dining here for Restaurant Week with a few friends. The ambience is perfect for  Girls Night Dinner or a Romantic evening. I arrived early and was pleasantly greeted by Jamie, the bartender. She was very attentive and friendly.  I asked her to make my own "special" drink and she did so with a smile. Shannon, the owner-I hope I got her name right, was very approachable and friendly as well. She even mentioned my drink Jackson Sunshine may be on the menu this summer! 

My friends & I were promptly seated upstairs where Jessica was our server. She was very pleasant and answered all of our questions with a smile. The food was amazing! Everything was cooked  well and beautifully presented! I've heard of some upscale restaurants have attitudes with Restaurant Week diners. This is something I've  never understood because they could be your next regular customer. I am happy to say I will definitely be returning to Global not only because of the delicious food but because of the excellent service!
