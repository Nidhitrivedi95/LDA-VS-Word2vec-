First, it took an exceptionally long time for our sandwiches to come out of the kitchen, which is a real turn-off for me when I am taking a break from work to get lunch.  Second, I asked for a refill of my $2.75 iced-tea and she said they charged for refills.  I have lived in AZ for 12 years and never been to a restaurant that charged for iced-tea refills.  My chicken salad sandwich was on a homemade French bread, but the top piece of bread had been sitting out too long and was stale while the bottom piece was nice and moist.  The food was good, but not enough to make me go back with the slow kitchen service and no refills of drinks.
