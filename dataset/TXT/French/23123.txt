bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg In full disclosure I removed a star due to the fact that we ( a party of 6) waited an hour for a table at brunch when one was open at least a 1/2 hour before we were sat. I had to ask the hostess why we weren't being seated at the open table and was told they were waiting for a booth and the family wouldn't leave but then sat us at the open table. Unfortunately after you wait an hour you have higher expectations (as in, I waited an hour this better be Frikkin awesome)...and it wasn't. My choc chip pancakes were great but I wasn't a fan of the chicken apple sausage (it was burnt & didn't taste like breakfast sausage). Our friends weren't impressed with their eggs Benedict. I probably wouldn't go back for brunch as I hate waiting more than 20 minutes unless the food is spectacular and this wasn't.
