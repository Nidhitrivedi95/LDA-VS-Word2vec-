oQIm77kYhudya-36pZ-3_w Based on take out cake I would come back to this spot again. 
Space is tight and the food choices seemed decent. The selection of fruit tarts was decent and they all looked appetizing. We were here for cake pick up and we got two. The chocolate layer cake was very good and that alone is worth the detour. The other cake was OK and didn't quite do it for moi.
Anyway will be back if I am in the area. 
4 Stars.
