UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw I've been here twice now for brunch.  The decor is very nice.  It is a large restaurant and feels like you are in Amurrica.  Both times the food has been less than stellar.  One particularly complaint is with the fries (frites).  They were hard and stale.  They tasted as if they had been cooked the previous night and reheated in a microwave.  It was bitterly disappointing to eat them in a French Bistro.  C'mon! 

I also had the eggs and steak and the eggs were cold (as were the poached eggs of my dining companion). On my first visit, I had the beef bourguignon poutine.  You can't be faulted for wanting to eat something that sounds so delicious but alas.. FAIL.  It was bland!  

I won't be back.
