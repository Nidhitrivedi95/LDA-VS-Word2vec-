gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Excellent view, very good service.  A good place for a special occasion.  Had the 7 course tasting menu.  Quite a bit of food offered at $155 per head.  The foie gras was excellent and so was the lobster thermadore.  The octopus salad, quail, and short rib were just average.  So, on Average, I would give the food 4 stars.
