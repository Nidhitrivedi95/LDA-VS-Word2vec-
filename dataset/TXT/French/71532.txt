XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w Everyone who gives his place bad reviews seems to be based on the price. The menu is right outside the opening. You can see the prices before you decide to eat here. The food is really good considering you are eating at an airport restaurant. If you have sometime to kill at the airport. I recommend eating here.
