xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Surprised I hadn't written a review for Point Brugges prior to today. They've been a staple for my family for a long time, especially their Sunday brunch.

It's quite simple in my case, I stick to the Moules (mussels) with either the white wine cream broth or the red curry broth with a side of frittes. Can't go wrong with either. He mussels are always throughly cleaned and cooked perfectly and come with a crisp slice of baguette.

While I order the mussels a lot at brunch as well, I occasionally go with the waffle with the topping of the day. Croque madam is great, coffee is some of the best in Pittsburgh, and lest I forget their perfectly spicy bloody Mary's.
