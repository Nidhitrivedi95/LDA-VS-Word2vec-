ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg The food here is good.  The service is very nice.  They have nice patio seating in the back, which I liked a lot.  The hostess spoke french, which is a plus, but as usual French cuisine is so overpriced.  The dishes on the menu are everyday and very typical French dishes and though they were good, they aren't great and definitely are not worth their price tags.  I've had much better food at the old Ma Provence in Squirrel Hill.  It's too bad the owner died and the place closed down.  From now on, I will just have to enjoy French food cooked at home.
