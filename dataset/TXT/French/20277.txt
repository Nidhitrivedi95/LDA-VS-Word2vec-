atNpoWy_XrhT9EUIEP6azg Metro Brasserie is a quite spacious restaurant located in downtown Scottsdale, focusing on French country cooking. 

My family decided on Metro more out of convenience than anything else. Our first choice was Over Easy, but sadly they were sacked with guests waiting out the door. 

My first impression about Metro came from the service. It's SLOW! Perhaps it was an off day or they were understaffed, but it took an exceptional amount of time for the server to deliver our drinks; drinks that were not made properly because the bartender was out and the manager had to step in. I know the bar issue is situational and not necessarily systemic, so I won't ding the rating there. The slow service is what dragged the rating down for me. 20 minutes for the food to arrive and we had to track down our server the check. 

Here is what we ordered: 

Drinks: 
Coffees, French 75, Bloody Mary 

Food: 
Tempura-Fried Bacon 
Eggs Benedict 
Ham Steak with chicory coffee gravy 
Bacon & Eggs 
French Toast with crème fraîche 

Without question, BEST item on our table (and the one that saved this from being a 2-star rating) was the Tempura-Fried Bacon. It was like wrapping a donut around a piece of bacon. It also came with a savory bourbon maple syrup for dipping. And that's were the gushing stops. 

Unfortunately, everything else on the table was so-so and not worth the money. There was nothing particularly good or bad with the French Toast or Ham Steak. My brother's fiance did enjoy the Eggs Benedict. Our total bill came to about $80, but I can think of a half dozen places where we might have gone and spent less cash with a better end result. 

I don't think Metro will be on my list when I return to AZ. 

Passing on seconds.
