B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA I've been procrastinating on this review because I have yet to get to Petite Maison for anything other than their late night staff meal. However, I cannot wait any longer, as I have never had anything but an exceptional experience here. Having known Chef James & Wendy from their previous restaurant (Tapino), I expected Petite Maison to be top-notch, but this location is so welcoming and cozy.

They could go cheap on the late night staff meals and the red cup specials, but they don't; the quality of the flavors are unbelievable. I've had a decadent foie gras mac & cheese, poutine with an over-the-top fried egg, and most recently, the most supreme BBQ beef piled on polenta. Each of these dishes were consumed on different occasions and each for just $10. The quality never fails and the staff is always friendly and accommodating. They even kept my leftovers warm the other night until I was ready to pack it in & head out (without me asking).
