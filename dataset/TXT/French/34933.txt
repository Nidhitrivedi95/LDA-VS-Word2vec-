HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Full disclosure: we used a Groupon deal, $51 for 2 entrees and a $39 bottle of wine or credit towards the wine list.

We arrived at Comme Ca a few minutes early and had a drink at the bar - very good.  We were seated in the main dining area, though sadly we didn't have a window seat.  Our server was fantastic and helped with some recommendations.  I got a steak and my husband got brisket.  Both were delicious - the brisket especially.  Instead of getting the rose that came with the Groupon (really, rose?) we upgraded to a nicer bottle, which the waiter packed for us in a cute little wine bag.

Overall, the restaurant wasn't too noisy and the next time we're in Vegas, I'd definitely go back!
