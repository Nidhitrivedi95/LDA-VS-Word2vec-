kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ Stopped by here for appetizers before an event. I loved the decor and the place is popular for happy hour. The service wasn't the best, which is why I had to give them 3 stars. We waited for someone to, at least, take our drink order but had to finally speak to the hostess to get some service. We didn't order drinks this time around but we did get the roasted cauliflower which was sooo good! It has cheese, nuts, and raisins (which add such a great flavor). I loved it! I wish we could've sampled more of their menu but I'll leave that for next time. It's a very lovely place with a great crowd. I will have to come back to try more food and hopefully next time the service will be better.
