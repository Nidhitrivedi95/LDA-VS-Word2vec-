mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Woohoo! As good as it gets!  is exactly right.  The fois gras amuse bouche was the best amuse my mouth has ever tasted.  It actually made me smile.  My wife had the tasting menu and I picked 7 small tastings then we split each as they arrived.  Every dish was complex, delicate and had wow factor.  Stop checking reviews and book this restaurant and have no worries.  We have eaten at most strip fine dining places, le cirque, picasso, alex, aureole, mix, nobhill, sage, etc etc.  This was one of the best meals to date.  Makes me even want to dish out double the money for Joel Robuchon.  Have no worries my friends, this is a wonderful experience.
