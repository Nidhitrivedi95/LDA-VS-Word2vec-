oPGUbqBpHNZvVu9gAFJbMQ My wife and I were visiting Montreal from the States to celebrate one of those big birthdays that seem to come around on a pretty regular basis. We chose to go to Chez Delmo as a Canadian friend(good friend) had mentioned it to us. As we were staying in old Montreal the Restaraunt was within easy walking distance from our hotel so we decided to walk and got there just as it was opening at 6pm on a Saturday night in August. We were greeted by a delightful young man who we later found out was the co-owner of the restaurant. He really set the tone for our visit- the staff was extremely attentive and attractive an catered to our needs. We started with escargot which was good but not exceptional- but what came next was out of this world. I ordered the Salmon tartar and I must say that I have had this dish in different restaraunt's around the world and Chez Delmo delivered best of class. My wife had a fresh fish Dory course which she really enjoyed. Washing  down a great meal with a refreshing Sav Blanc from France, which for the price was a steal. The piece du resistance was when my wife's creme brûlée arrived. It arrived with one lit candle celebrating my wife's birthday, thanks to Adam's thoughtfulness. We had a great evening and will be visiting Chez Delmo during our next visit to Montreal.
