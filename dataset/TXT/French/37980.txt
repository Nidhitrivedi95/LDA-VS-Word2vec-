Jbl6p9CVkfCB8fWYFd2-Qw Went there when it first opened up - fantastic - then it went downhill fast.  Finally went back to see if things have changed, and they have for the better, and hope it continues because they are not there yet.  The food is good, but not great given the prices - in the non italian category they are competing with L'albatros and Washington Inn.  The big change is in their hospitality - the original manager is gone and they finally seem like they are truly trying to accomodate their clients.

The atmosphere is great - fun bar to sit at.  Had the Tuna entree.  The tuna was actually some of the best I have had, but this side of some kind of sauteed onions had a strange flavor and did not complement the entree.  We also shared the steak frites.  I believe it was flank - well prepared, thought for being flavored with a chimichurri sauce, it seemed under-seasoned.  The fries were nice, but a bit bland.

The bartender Sarah is awesome - seems like she is doing most of the work in the place - they really need to get their teamwork together.

All in all - a good place and hopefully will continue to get better.  Worth a try.  I truly hope they make it since I live in the neighborhood, its a really cool spot and it's great having options other than Italian food.
