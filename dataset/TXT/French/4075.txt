2g7BfzamlNGPP6jMZrt8kw I was pretty disappointed with this restaurant. My group decided to meet there for a nice dinner after a long day of work. It was Formula 1 weekend so we reserved a table ahead of time. The restaurant was busy and loud (dance/club music was playing which I found strange), it didn't seem to fit with the atmosphere of the restaurant. 

I found service to be very poor. The server was slow in greeting our table, taking our drink order and drinks took around 15 minutes to come to or table. We would have ordered more drinks during our visit if the service wasn't so slow. We finally had to get up and ask for service after waiting a very long time to place our order. The server came over and stated she didn't realize we were ready to order, despite our menus being closed and our body language indicating we were ready. Food was delicious though (we ordered the linguine, beef tartar, and salmon), however my drink sat empty for a while, and another person in our party never received the wine she had ordered for her meal. The server blamed another server for not bringing the drink but did nothing else to satisfy us. For a restaurant with meals listed around $35 a plate, and drinks at $12 per cocktail, I expected a much higher level of service.
