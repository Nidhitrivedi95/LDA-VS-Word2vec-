I had been wanting to try this place for a while, but it's WAAY off the beaten path for me, so I waited until I had to pick up my equally adventurous niece (hereinafter referred to as "Rosebud") from the airport, and we decided to search it out for a late lunch. ("Search" is no exaggeration - thanks to whoever posted that handy little map!)

Once you find it, it's a pleasant little place with an absolute sweetheart (Olivier - the aforementioned Frenchman) behind the counter. Selections were on a chalkboard. I went with the curried chicken sandwich and zucchini parmesan soup. The bread was great, and the chicken was hot, juicy, and clearly freshly cooked. Rosebud went for the four-cheese special, and wound up having to scrape off some of the gorgonzola because it was too pungent. I had zero sympathy. People who order blue-veined cheeses get what they deserve.

Because dessert is mandatory, she went with a croissant stuffed with Nutella, which she would have preferred heated. (Mighty picky for a non-paying guest, don't you think?), and I had the last slice of chocolate tart, which I eyed nervously every time some potential interloper stepped anywhere near the display case. It was silky and rich, and it was mine.

Fellow Diet Coke addicts, be forewarned: Olivier fell victim to the silly internet urban legends about D.C. not being good for you, and stocks an alien brand of sugarless cola. The bottle was beautiful, and it didn't taste too bad, but it was not a reasonable substitute. I yam what I yam, and next time I'll bring my own.
