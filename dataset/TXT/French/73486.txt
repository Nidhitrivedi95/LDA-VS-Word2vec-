xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g This restaurant was recommended to us by a colleague. We came here for dinner during sunset to celebrate Father's Day. Before arriving I received text messages from the restaurant about the dress code and any special requests we had. I asked them to write #1 father on the dessert dish and they confirmed.

The service from start to finish was smooth and professional. The view from our table was incredible. If you're looking to woo a date, bring them here.

We ordered their "best dish", which was the lamb chops and it was good. It didn't have that overwhelming lamb taste.  We also ordered the queen filet mignon and the veal medallions. On the side we had asparagus and mashed potatoes (good, but they are an extra cost). 

For dessert we had the pistachio soufflé. Now this was the dish that was suppose to say #1 dad but unfortunately they forgot. That was slightly disappointing but the dessert was delicious and skillfully made. I would return.
