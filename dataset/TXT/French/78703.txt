ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug I feel that this place is meant for the gambleholics who just want a quick bite so they can return to their gambling immediately. 

All the food we ordered was horrible. I can't comprehend how food of this quality could make to Vegas. 

Service: terrible. It does not seem that they were under-staffed. The wait outside was long... MORE wait at the table after being seated... LONGER wait after we ordered. By the time the food came out, I was full stuffing too much bread (which wasn't any thing extraordinary, I was just too hungry from waiting)

Last visit was my second time (due to friends wanted to go there) it would also be the last visit.

Don't come here.
