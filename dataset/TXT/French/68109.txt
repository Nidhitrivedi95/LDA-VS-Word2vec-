vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ Went to dinner for my birthday.  We had a small group of 4 people and we all had a great experience. Our server knew the menu and details of each item. Even knew where it came from and exactly how it's prepared. She was attentive but allowed us plenty of time to enjoy the evening. Food was amazing. Would recommend to anyone for a nice dinner.
