O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg 3.5 - Been meaning to check this place out for quite some time. Service was just okay but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt cause I went for dinner later in the evening. Plus the guy who delivered my food said I had good taste in what I ordered so there's good staff my waiter was just preoccupied.
Drink prices may seem steep but once you see the wine list you might as well grab a cocktail, and the choices really complemented the season.
Food quality was excellent. I started with oysters which were briny just how I like them. Could have done a tiny tiny better job removing the grit but not at all bad. Then got the mac and cheese with andouille sausage and it was so rich and buttery. Would have liked to stay for dessert and a coffee but the vibe I was getting was to clear out.
I would definitely go back just for drinks. It wasn't a disappointing experience but I'm sure for the price there's something in the area that's downright spectacular.
