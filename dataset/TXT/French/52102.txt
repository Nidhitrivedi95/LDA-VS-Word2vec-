pmrHuQiy25xKB86tbOLBlA I'm a Matthews resident and have been going to this restaurant for the past 11 years.  I wouldn't call myself a regular, but probably go there six times in a year--for lunch and supper.  

My husband and I have never been disappointed by a meal there.  I'm a somewhat picky eater and approach the menu from the vegetable (always fresh from a local farmer's market) end of the spectrum, while he is fonder of the meats on the menu.  We're both always satisfied with what we get.

The restaurant is in a historic building in downtown Matthews--a beautiful old place and nice setting for a meal. I would call the atmosphere 'intimate.'  The tables are covered in white-tablecloths, but there is a variety of dress there....you'll see people in everything from dressy to very casual attire.

Meals are usually in the $15--$20 range and have artful presentation.

Parking is on the street or in a small lot behind the restaurant (you'd have to go around the block to reach it.)

We've never had a problem with the service, although it's a small staff. You get more of a family feel with their interactions between each other and the diners. 

Highly recommended.
