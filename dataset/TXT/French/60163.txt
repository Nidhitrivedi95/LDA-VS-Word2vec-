sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ Everything that's been said about the food is spot-on; some of the best ingredients you'll ever have, prepared with the utmost respect in an amazing fashion.  It's not a meal, its an experience.

We got to Jaleo 15 minutes before our reservation, as requested, and ended up waiting another half hour to be taken into the "restaurant".  Some other reviewers have mentioned getting a glass of champagne when they show up, we were never offered any.  No worries though, watching everything going on in Jaleo is entertaining enough.  Ended up being because someone else didn't make it; sucks for them.

Some have mentioned that pricing is rather ambiguous, however, we didn't find this to be the case at all.  While we were waiting, Patrick, our server for the evening, explained everything well, gave us the ipad drink list, explained the wine pairings, etc.  I did the Taste of Spain pairing, which was good for the most part, but I found a couple of the pairings odd.  Not sure if it was worth the $130 or not.

The only real gripe we had, and it is a pretty big one, was that the servers made a point of telling us that the Chefs were included in the automatic gratuity, and that we were welcome to leave extra "if we desired."  I'm sorry, but that's tacky.  I own a restaurant, and if I heard one of my servers doing this I'd flip.  There's no need for that in a restaurant of this caliber.

Besides that, totally worth the money, amazing experience, the room itself is beautiful, service is fantastic, and the food alone makes going here worth it.
