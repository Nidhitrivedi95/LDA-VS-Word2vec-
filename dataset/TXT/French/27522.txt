I had to add a little more soy sauce into it but that might just be my own taste preference for saltier foods. As for the pho, the portions were big (my friends ordered that) but the price was a little bit more expensive (especially the egg rolls) than we expected but maybe that's because we're from the east coast were it might be cheaper. Our waiter was nice and helpful.
