sAOgSr6suAE4axjIFSbtLQ Wow, this place is sexy!  What a fun little gem right in Lake Norman.  Not only did I feel as if I had stepped out of the Carolina's and into a little bar in NYC, but the staff was super nice and helpful (not like NY haha) 

They offer $6 wine tastings every Thursday which is perfect for a fun weeknight escape, and have plenty of comfy couches to lounge on if you get there early enough to snag one. 

My favorite thing about the Wine Cellar though, was the perfect little menu of bar nibbles. They have hummus for $2.50 -- unheard of!  They also have these really delicious sandwiches if you are a little hungrier. My favorite is the Parisien - French Ham, Butter, and Cornichons -- just like they do in France...mmm takes me back to studying abroad in Paris! 

I can't wait to go back -- its so nice to find a classy wine bar with a non pretentious atmosphere and a great staff. Vive la France!
