_eNeiqWPt1MPLFF6DEIJeA Best sushi in Lakewood! Went on a Wednesday and the staff even moved our table out of the sun to make sure the environment was perfect. Steamed bun appetizers were so delicious (Kung pao was amazing!) got several sushi items and the beer menu was extensive, manager even came out to explain rolling beer menu. A must visit location in Lakewood!!!!
