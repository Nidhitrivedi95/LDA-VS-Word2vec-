teTQU7TIPE0O_B1zN_239w I'm wary of anything that tries to pass itself off as "Nawlins" style food.  Mimi's may be a chain, but for all that, the food is quite good and reasonably priced.  If you're feeling the urge on a Sunday, let me recommend you call ahead for takeout.  They do a wonderful job and it will travel at least a good 15 minutes without becoming too cold.  Hey if you want to go spend your time waiting with all the other people in their "I just got out of church" outfits, go right ahead.  I'd rather book it to a park than stand around waiting for my name to be called.

You'll find the usual heart attacks on a plate for breakfast which is my favorite thing to order here.  Personally, I'm a dirty little whore for the Pain Perdu.  Is it the french toast? The cream cheese? The marmalade?  Taken separately, any one of these is a temptation that can be resisted.  Throw them together, and I would totally stick check your grandmother and mine if they were between me and my Pain Perdu.  Hyperbole? Perhaps, but I'm telling you -  This stuff is love on a plate.  LOVE.  Get it inside of you.  It will make you giddy.  Better looking, smarter, charming, successful.  Or at the very least fat.

I could talk about the deliciousness of the Crab Cake Benedict, The Breakfast Quiche, the fresh squeezed orange and grapefruit juice, but I won't do it.  That would only distract you from the Pain Perdu.  Lunch and dinner are acceptable.  I like the salads, and the frisco burger, but there's nothing that really gets me all hot and bothered the way the Pain Perdu does.

Say it with me, "I'll have the Pain Perdu"
