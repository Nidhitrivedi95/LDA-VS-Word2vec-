The Croque Monsouir sandwich, which is a grilled ham sandwich with cheese melted on top is great.  The mocha coffee is so tasty, I highly recommend this with the whipped cream.  The almond crossoint is made well, it's fluffy, tender yet crisp with great flavour.  Overall a faboulous place to eat lunch or just to go on a date too.
