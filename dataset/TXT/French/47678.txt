O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Thank God our server Sal tried everything in his power to make our anniversary dinner special! Unfortunately our special night that we had planned at Morels for dinner was less than satisfactory due to the fact that there was no seafood available at all! We were so looking forward to the many choices on the menu and was told that what we wanted was not available. No seafood at all! Yes it was Labor Day but that isn't an excuse just poor planning! Sal as I said did everything in his power to keep us at this restaurant. We came from a long distance to stay at the luxurious Palazzo and to have our special anniversary dinner at Morel's! So disappointed! We decided to give Morel's one last chance on our departing day and have breakfast. Sal our server wasn't there but we had a great breakfast! Crab Benedict and buttermilk pancakes, and Lox and bagels. Delicious!
