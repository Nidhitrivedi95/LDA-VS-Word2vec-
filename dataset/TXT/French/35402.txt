htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ I ordered the "Extra Butter" Coconut Shrimp as an appetizer.  The dish had beautiful presentation and the butter ginger coconut sauce was divine.  I just wish it had more than 6 pieces of shrimp as you are paying $14, so I don't see the value in ordering it again.  

For the main entrée, I got their signature INSP Burger with duck confit fries.  The burger was absolutely delicious.  It had the juiciest prime beef patty I ever had. the ground beef was well seasoned. The burger had so many dimensions of flavour, the tomato mayo slathered on a super soft brioche bun and was further enhanced by a generous slice of smoky pork belly and the creaminess of a fried egg.   For the side, I upgraded to the duck confit fries, the fries were dressed with kimchi mayo sauce, red chilies, green onions and shredded duck meat were also tasty, but the only thing that concerned me was the Yukon gold potato fries were too salty.  

I would come again next time to try Inspire's other highly recommended Udon Carbonara.  Too bad, I only have room for one entrée at a time.
