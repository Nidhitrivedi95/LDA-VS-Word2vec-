pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg We arrived about 45 minutes prior to our reservation and decided to check out the cigar lounge.  I had a snifter of Courvoisier and a "Hemingway Short Story" cigar.  As advertised, the air filtration system kept the smoke clear while we had our drinks.

A group of 4, we all chose the 5 course tasting menu with wine pairing.  The food and wine were excellent and the staff was friendly and accommodating.  It was a 5 star experience, but I'm only giving the restaurant 4 stars because I can't really pick out a single course to write about - all great courses, but nothing really blew me away.
