Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ Food was a delight, service was impeccable. In visiting Montreal, I invited a local friend who was amazed at the quality of food and wine, and surprised not to have heard about the restaurant. Enjoyed the oysters to start the evening meal. My friend had the rack of lamb and I had the lobster and veal special for the night. Best restaurant I've been to in Montreal so far, and I plan to be back to try another item on the menu. Did I say our waiter described the menu quite well and made a good recommendation for the wine?
