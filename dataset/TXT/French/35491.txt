htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ I had bookmarked Inspire Restaurant since July 2014. And it took me so long till I finally here for dinner.

Saturday Reservation: Either 6:15 or 8:15 pm. We are cool with late dinner as we can take our time without being rushed.

4 Star for what Inspire Restaurant brings to the Markham, a "Downtown" quality restaurant in the suburbs. Interesting and unique offerings compares to other in the area.

We ordered a few things to share:

Short Ribs As-Is ($10) - Meh
Wonton Au Gratin ($12) - A-OK
Chicken & Waffle ($16) - A-OK the boneless chicken was so juicy! I love ginger maple syrup too!
The INSP Burger ($15)  Duck Confit Fries (+$4) - Burger was good, Fries were soggy!
Udon Carbonara ($18)

Banana Bread Ice Cream Sandwich ($12) - Best Item of the Night! Banana Me!
Green Tea Chili Cheesecake ($10)

Food is 3 Star in general. Most of them were not too memorable aside from the Banana Bread Ice Cream Sandwich as I have this thing with those mini peanut butter cups!

Service. Service might be the biggest issue of the evening. Waitress no where to be seen when we wanted to order dessert or get our bill. Mind you, the restaurant was almost empty aside from another table. I hate doing that, but I have to yell out and wave one of them down so we can get someone to take our order. The service here is equivalent and remind me of BBT joint. On the other hand, the bus boy was really nice always making sure that our water glasses never empty.

I am happy to have Inspire Restaurant in my neighbourhood. I will probably be back and hopefully the service will be better next time.
