4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Great ambiance...great food and an excellent server. The braised lamb was delicious and the brie, honey and garlic appetizer was a great starter. Our server was absolutely awesome- extremely attentive and very knowledgeable. We asked his opinion between two wines and even though one was only available by the glass he gave us the bottle and even offered multiple tastings of like selections. Classy, lively and filling. Definitely recommend it!
