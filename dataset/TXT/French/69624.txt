WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w "Very average" is how I would describe my experience at Universel Déjeuner et Grillades. While the food is not exactly terrible, it is barely okay and definitely too pricey for what it is.

My husband and I went visited Universel on a Tuesday evening during "Happy Hour" (4-7PM), which allows for two drinks for the price of one, a very nice touch and probably the only redeeming part of the experience, alongside the waiter's mostly genuine but strained smile. I had a veggie pizza which turned out to be as unmemorable as any other cheap pizza place (except I would probably pay less for it elsewhere - heck, even pizzapizza is tastier!). He had a vegetarian souvlaki which was first served to him with chicken, until we went to the counter to point out there had been a mistake with our order. Five minutes later, the right plate was brought from the kitchen; much better, but still very "okay" taste-wise.

The sangria was good enough, and so was the house red wine, especially with the 2 for 1 promotion. The place looks nice... And that's pretty much it. Unexciting experience. I can think of many better places to spend my money at in Montreal's vibrant restaurant scene. We will not go back.
