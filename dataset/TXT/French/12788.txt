4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Finally getting around to reviewing Mon Ami Gabi. I have dined here at least  3 times -  only once inside - 

Items sampled: 
Lobster Bisque
Country Style Pâté cornichons, whole grain mustard, country toast 6.95
Steak Au Poivre brandy peppercorn sauce 23.95
Cod and frites (not included on current menu) $?
creme brûlée
Flourless chocolate cake


This is a special favorite place for me, such that of all the choices in Vegas on a 2 day visit, my x husband and I  went  2 nights in a row...

We preferred  dining outside to inside,  the view & music of the Bellagio fountain and just the general romantic  feel we had while sitting there transcended Vegas... Service was adequate, and exactly what I expected, the wait staff did not fawn over us  & we had what we needed when we needed it...Loved the outdoor heaters because  we seemed to always go to Vegas in spring and it was chilly...Loved  the crusty baguette in its protective sleeve. **( They also bring another dish with the baguette but memory fails what it was )**

I'm the kind of girl who finds the one thing at a certain restaurant that  I always order, no deviation, for my husband it was the Steak Au Poivre for me the fish (cod) and frites...Let me  just  preface  this with I am a potato kinda girl, love 'em....I "get"  the frites...   not sure why other reviewers  seem to have had such an issue... these aren't french fries people....The fish was scrumptious - in a meunière  sauce - 
Deserts -  Loved  the flourless chocolate cake  -
Je Reviens...
