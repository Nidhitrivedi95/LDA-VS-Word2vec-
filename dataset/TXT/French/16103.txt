78TC3sZSYBzBsSJ0z5pyhw We had $75 in gift cards for numerous restaurants on the strip.  We happened to be in the Paris hotel and were hungry and looked at the lunch menu, which looked appealling.  We decied to try it.  We ordered a beer and the french onion soup, which was outstanding!  The outstanding part stopped there!  We had to flag down our waiter for another drink and refills on water.  We waited at least 45 minutes for our meal, which we ordered sauteed mushrooms, which came cold, a beef dip and strip steak with bernaise.  The whole meal was cold and the steak was tough.  Our server never checked on us and our LUNCH meal was $90!!!  Luckily we had a $75 voucher!  
Pricey, terrible service and bad food!
