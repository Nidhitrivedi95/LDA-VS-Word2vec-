aSC-WLyJptVpziJpR98Ykg My first night in Montreal I spent at Chez L'epicer. The service was wonderful. It was about 10:30pm and they didn't hesitate to seat us. We decided to order the seven course meal with wine pairing. I usually don't order set meals but thought why not try something different. It offered a full tasting of almost the entire menu.
1.) Hot broth with lemongrass and tomato, kampachi fish, yuze meringue and kumquat carpaccio.
2.) Frog legs, grilled eggplant, watercress puree with butter, garlic and parsley cromesquis.
3.) Sweetbreads, glazed ginger, mushroom risotto. (The winner)
4.) Pressed foie gras from Elysee Farm, compressed apple compost, beet roll-up with cider vinegar and syrup, micro-amaranth, dill and cinamon crumble.
5.) Boileau venison cooked at 54 degrees, mini stuffed cabbage, creamy sweet potatoes, cinnamon foam.
6.) Cheese puff, apple laque
7.) Greek yogurt sphere with pistachio powder, coriander and basil lichen, pistachio crumble.

Seven different wines served with each dish.I'm not a wine expert at all but each wine seemed to enhance the taste of the food. Had a great meal. I can't tell you how pleasant the service was. Friendly and efficient to the max.
