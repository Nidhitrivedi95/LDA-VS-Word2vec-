Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Inattentive waitstaff....rotting lettuce....gross.
Food does not match the ambience. 
I love staying at the Wynn property because of the usually excellent attention to detail and really great restaurants, casual to fine dining.  We decided to try Tableau for brunch.
Very, very disappointed.  I ordered the arugula salad that was horrible.  Half of the arugula was slimy and dark green/black.  Maybe it's just me, but I think the greens should be vibrant, intact(no rotting bits), and taste like arugula should.The waitress didn't seem to think much was anything
wrong with it.  I don't think she addressed it with the chef, as no further mention was made of it and she did not take it off the bill.  I did not pursue any further complaint because I did not want to make anyone in my party uncomfortable.
Asked for bread...they didn't bring it.
They were not busy at all...maybe with good reason because I sure won't be back.
A few observations:
   Heirloom Tomato Salad ($20)-  presentation bare bones - sliced with balsamic dressing drizzled on.  Please.....
Wasabi Bloody Mary (~$14)was lacking presentation as well...the cucumber slice was wilted and dried, unappetizing.
