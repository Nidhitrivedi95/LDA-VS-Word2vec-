MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA I love Colette's baked goods - the croissants are buttery, rich, and crisp. The pain au chocolat and almond croissant are also particularly lovely. 

Both times I've been here I've ordered from the bakery. The smoked salmon croissant sandwich ($9) is delicious. It includes hard boiled eggs, arugula, and a fresh mayonnaise. 

The interior of the bakery is stunning and it's lovely sitting out on the patio. Staff are very friendly and chatty. The drinks can sometimes take a while to come out, but staff will arrange to bring them to your table if there will be a bit of a wait.
