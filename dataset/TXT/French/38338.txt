JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g The small triangle cafe is a small tucked away romantic eatery, best suited for a date night out.  The interior is not much to brag about, however they have created an ambiance of small French eatery serving up mouth watering light and heavy affair.  They have retained their specialty of crepes (this place used to be called Le Oui Oui Cafe under different management) as well as have added French influenced dinner items.  During my last visit, I was pleasantly surprised by 4 specials for dinner - something I did not expect from seemingly small early like Triangle Cafe. The crepes are as always delicious, the staff are attentive, the price ranges from $9 to $18 on average around dinner.  Most of the items I so far have tasted are excellent and the portions are just right. 

Their seating area is not kid friendly due to close proximity of tables and limited seating space.
