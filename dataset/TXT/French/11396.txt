4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw As a vegetarian, I sometimes I struggle to find a GOOD vegetarian option at a restaurant. With almost no vegetarian options I was interested in, they were so so so accommodating with my dietary restrictions and what I was craving. All day I was in the mood for a pasta, they whipped me up a delicious vegetarian pasta (they made several modifications to an existing menu item to make it for me) and I can easily say it was one of the best pastas I've ever had in my entire life! Not only that, eating it on the patio while facing the Bellagio fountains was just the icing on the cake  definitely recommend this place. And if you see any reviews saying the wait is too long ignore it because there will be a wait at any LV strip restaurant.
