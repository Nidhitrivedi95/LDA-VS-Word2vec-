ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw I came here on a Sunday afternoon and it looked like they were prepping for their dinner rush.  However, we were seated outside on their hidden patio near the very back of the restaurant. We ordered drinks and a small appy of cold cut meats with bread which was delicious.  Our server was attentive and extremely profressional...maybe even too professional because he didnt laugh at any of our jokes... 

Anyways... I will be coming  back here to try out the main entrees along with the wonderful apps.  This review is strictly based on the service and quick drinks they gave us.  Everything was awesome.
