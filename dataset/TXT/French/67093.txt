USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg Fig Tree is one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. The restaurant is in an older home and has a wonderful, inviting ambiance. The service is always attentive and friendly. 

Everything that I have ever ordered from seafood to desserts has been excellent. They have an expansive selection of wine. You will not be disappointed with the Fig Tree.
