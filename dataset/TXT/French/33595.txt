hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I wish there were more of these, and I wish one of them were in my area of Las Vegas, because Baguette Cafe is my kind of place!  While it is located in a business plaza in Southwest Las Vegas, it is the best cafe I have been to in town.  The sandwiches are what brought me here, and it is what will bring me back.  

The service was very friendly and attentive.  The owner, Olivier, is a UNLV graduate, something we both had in common.  After talking to him for a little while, I found out he has worked as manager at some of the top places on the strip (Aureole, Bouchon, Joel Robuchon).  You could tell that he knew his food, because the sandwich I had was top notch.  
One of his suggestions was the Chipotle Chicken Sandwich, so I thought that sounded great.  They brought out the sandwich on a glass plate, with a real fork.  It even came with a small side salad, which was very nice.  I think next time I may also try one of their soups.  

I will be going back to Baguette Cafe soon and often, and suggest that you go too!
