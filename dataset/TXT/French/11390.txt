4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I was staying at the Paris and I would always see people doing the al fresco dining when I'd walk pass, so I thought I'd stop in and try to grab a quick meal before flying out that afternoon.

Actually because of that flight, the waiter said he'd talk to the kitchen to expedite my meal.  My seat wasn't outside, but I had a nice sunny window seat.    

I ordered the full order of mussels which came with frites.  Moules et frites are my favorite!!  What I really liked though is they dropped off a fresh warm baguette in a bag at every table.  There's nothing I like more than being able to dip bread into the stockpot of mussels.  Well the meal came out after about 15 minutes...either it wasn't expedited or I'm scared to see how long it'd take normally.  

The mussels were really good in a nice stock that wasn't too rich.  The "handmade" frites came in a paper cone on a stand and had a nice thin and flat shape, but I thought they tasted a bit stale.  I wonder if I just had a bad batch.  I'd definitely come back for the mussels.      

In the end, I jogged out of the restaurant and left the strip an hour before my flight was to depart; barely making my flight.
