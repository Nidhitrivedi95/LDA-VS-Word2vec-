I ordered a Tom Collins to drink, and it was garnished with a cherry, slice of lime, and piece of hair. Lovely. Then came my chicken club. I had asked my server what the sandwich consisted of, and he was not too sure what came on it. Sadly, not much. Toasted bread, as little chicken as possible, and a couple pieces of bacon and a leaf or two of lettuce. Oh, and no mayonnaise on it. This thing was dry as the desert itself. And the 'pom frites' may as well be called potato chip crumbs. Yuck. I usually like to gives a restaurant I didn't enjoy another chance to redeem itself, but I will not be doing that with this place. Eat at Earl of Sandwich instead.
