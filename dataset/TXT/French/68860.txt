VSPft3RUXDE8HnX6Anvbvg Sadly disappointed.

We arrived at 7:30 for our reservation to a 1/2 full restaurant and were seated next to a children's table. We ordered a bottle of local wine and our meals which, albeit experimental, were disappointing. The veal was tough and the pork was dull. 

Worst of all, after we finished our expensive but unexciting meal, it took nearly an hour of being ignored by our server before we could leave. For what we paid (nearly $300), we expected a level of service that was sorely lacking at DNA.
