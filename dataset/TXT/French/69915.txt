WOj8nPos3R9IIf0Pyttd8g My husband and I have tried nearly every restaurant in Charlotte and Lulu ranks highest, along with neighboring Bistro Le Bon and Montford's Good Food.  If you are a "foodie," you'll love Lulu's.  The pommes frites are very large (enough for a table of 4 to share) and are accompanied by delicious sauces.  I had the Portuguese Mussels for my entree and they were perfectly steamed and included spicy chorizo and tomato broth.  

As a bonus, the restaurant is in a charming, old home.  Very quaint.  They also have their own parking lot - always a bonus.
