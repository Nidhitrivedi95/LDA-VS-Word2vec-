1aj4TG0eFq6NaPBKk6bK7Q I don't write many reviews, but I felt this was seriously underrated. Beautiful atmosphere, nice lighting and music. We had carry out of a hamburger and half a salad with chicken and a few pastry items. Delicious! I loved the blue cheese dressing. My husband's burger was cooked perfectly, juicy, and a yummy bun. We will definitely go back, maybe even for date night. The prices were reasonable and frankly with the high quality ingredients, I felt were a deal. Try this place.
