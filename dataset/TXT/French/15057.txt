63hkYvXXcZsHeCeZBQbfew The best poutine I ever had! Ordered the chicken poutine. The fries was crispy, the cheese was half-melted and the chicken was full of flavours. This is exactly the way I wanted my poutine! 
The guy made fresh fries for me and put on some spicy powder on top, made the poutine even more tasty! Love it so much!
