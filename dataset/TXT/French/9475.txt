4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw One of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. Every time I go I get the Prime burger with blue cheese, and frites on the side. I haven't been able to try anything else because I love this burger so much!! Their prices are very reasonable. $13 for the burger I get. We went last night on a saturday at 7pm and waited an hour and a half for a table on the patio. The service is great as well.
