1blpPH0_3jk2EnRz_Q_CuQ this fast food restaurant is on a very small grass hill. i felt like i was in a parallel world and i felt very small. like a small man. i had several buses to catch and thankfully this place was nearby. i caught my buses on time, i staved off a disaster in my professional life and i felt like it might be my last time in the suburbs. it's difficult to switch my accent between white and cringy black imitation white and i'm on the bus to change that.
