zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw Went to Merci on March 1st for breakfast. The Chef came out and greeted us and made us fantastic food. Coffee was great and the pastries are to die for. The location is no great shakes (in a shopping center next to a Subway) but don't let that discourage you, it's worth a visit.
