bRmb81XDG3E2SOHARBLTog Went here for the happy hour specials. There were maybe 4 people in the entire place yet we waited 20 mins for a server to take our drink order. He may or may not have been stoned or drunk. Very inattentive- he walked away as we tried to order food.
The food arrived and the portions were VERY small. One bite crab cakes for $8 and a crostini drizzled in balsamic for $7.
