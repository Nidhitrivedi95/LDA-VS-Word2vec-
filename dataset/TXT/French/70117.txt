wwgRu0TAMX8rfRhsiI0ifQ Went here for the first time before a show. We started out in the bar area for Happy Hour (HH). We ordered all 3 appetizers offered at HH prices (Calamari,  Hummus and Meatball Sliders) plus some drinks.  The food was excellent.  When our table was ready we were seated. Our server was excellent and so was the food. Huge portions too. I don't think I would make a special trip out there to eat but next time I'm at Aliante I'll probably stop by again.
