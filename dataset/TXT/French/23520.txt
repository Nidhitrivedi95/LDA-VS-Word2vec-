ChwyMZi_eZlMfL9qpXH_zw Came on Sunday for brunch. Very friendly staff and the food was beautifully presented and delicious. A good variety of Benedicts and a huge choices of crepes. 

I'm a huge smoked salmon fan so opted for the salmon Benedict. They also have a scallops Benedict with baby spinach...wish I have 2 stomachs. 

The salmon Benedict comes with asparagus and capers. The hollandaise sauce was really fresh tasting and yummy. Very lemony. The look is beautiful and tasted great too. The asparagus were a bit over cooked but still good overall in the dish. 

Breakfast comes with mini fruit salad, yogurt and the most delicious croquettes. Piping out and perfectly crispy on the outside and so creamy on the inside. 

Pretty quiet place too, not blasting lout music and the crowd is mellow. Definitely would recommend to come here for breakfast brunch and lunch!  Everything looks good from other tables too.
