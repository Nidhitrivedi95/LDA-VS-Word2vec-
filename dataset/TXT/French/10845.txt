4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Had a 6:30 reservation yesterday but were told it was first come first served for the patio, waited 1:15 before we were seated, the bar area was so small and jamb packed it was impossible even to have a drink. Table was good but very close together so you share the next tables conversation, appetizers great, main course came out cold and the pepper steak had a sauce that tasted like tomato paste. Our waitress was terrific but the front desk staff are totally disinterested. As a local why fight the crowds when there are so many other places to eat
