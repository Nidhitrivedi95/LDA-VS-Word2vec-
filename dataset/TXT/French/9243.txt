4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Stopped off in Las Vegas on our road trip to TX.  My fiance made a dinner reservation for our anniversary.  It would've been nice to sit outside in the patio which has a nice view of the Bellagio fountains.  Unfortunately, the wait for outside was like an hour or more.  I wonder if you can request an outside table while making a reservation.  Maybe we'll try that next time.

Ok, let's get to the food.  They serve a delicious crusty french baguette with butter at your table once you are seated.  We didn't order any appetizers because we wanted to fill up on the main course - STEAK!  I ordered the Steak Bearnaise and my fiance ordered the Steak Bourdelaise.  The bearnaise sauce was nice, smooth, and creamy and tasted soooo good together with the steak.  The bourdelaise was a delicious red wine sauce with caramelized onions.  Both steaks were served with their hand-cut fries.  Their fries are unique in the way they're cut.  They're flat and wide and fried nice and crispy.  This is one of our favorite restaurants and will definitely make this a place to come to every time we're in Vegas.
