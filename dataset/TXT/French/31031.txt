My GF wanted another cup of coffee so I ordered a second one but when I went to pay with my credit card they said they had a $5 minimum on card purchases.  I had just spent $18 on coffee, fries and beignets and after sending the fries back I would have thought they'd either run the card for the $3.26 or give us a complimentary cup of coffee.   We love to patronize mom and pop places but they need to differentiate themselves with customer service and empower their employees to serve their customers.    I will not be coming back here.  They need to think outside the box.
