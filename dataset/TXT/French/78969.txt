ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug I do not know why we decided to come here without looking on yelp first. The menu sounded yummy, the place is cute, but that's it.
They sat us and the bill from the previous party was sitting there until after they even brought our of coffee orders. Water came at the end of the meal. My egg sandwich was not fully cooked as the white part was still clear. In all, it took about an hour for a $50 breakfast for 2 (egg sandwich, French toast and 2 coffees-no alcohol).
