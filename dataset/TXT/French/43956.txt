m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA After looking at Yelp for top rated breakfast joints in the North Scottsdale area, we decided to finally make a stop here.  I am so glad we took all of your advice!  Chez Vous was quite a treat and now ranks among my list of top breakfast locales that are worthy a drive to visit.

Since the weather was nice, we sat outside at a cute little table and enjoyed prompt service by a young french speaking gentleman.  He gave us some wonderful recommendations for crepes and brought us bellinis with fresh peach since they ran out of mimosas.  

I ordered the Croque Madame after seeing the photo on their website - and it was everyone's favorite!  fresh ham, eggs cooked to perfection.... yum!

We also got the provencale crepes and a lorraine omelet.  Nothing disappointed and came out looking like it could be photographed.

So thank you fellow yelpers for bringing me to what is now one of my favorite breakfast spots in the valley!
