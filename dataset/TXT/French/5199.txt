3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw I usually never give a bad review BUT this really made me angry. I worked a full shift and then some on Christmas Eve, I was tired, hungry, and so was my entire family. I checked the website the hours were posted, it said closed at 11PM. So me and my entire family rushed over to the location at 830PM, went to open the door to restaurant it was LOCKED. There were no signs posted about their holiday hours, or even a sign that said they were CLOSED. Me and family waited for someone to at least open the door and say, " I'm Sorry but we are Closed " instead the workers who were wiping tables looked at us and ignored us. Would it have been so hard for anyone to just politely address myself and my entire family, but NO all we got was the cold freezing wind hitting us while waiting outside for not even a response. We often visit Mimi Cafe ALOT, just not that location and NOW for good reasons. A simple response goes a long way BUT since we didn't get one, you will not only lose me and my family as customers BUT all those we know who might now re-think about going to this restaurant.
