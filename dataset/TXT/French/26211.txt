d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q When I think The Amazing and fantastic chef Daniel Boloud I think of his restaurant Daniel and DBGB this place was nothing like it I have to say I was extremely disappointed I came into this place with high hopes today for lunch even though the room is beautiful and the lights and booths were really neat and fancy the overall mood was ruined by very minor details that could bring this place to become the top of the food chain in restaurants in Las Vegas. My complaints are that as I was sitting down I was overhearing what looked like to be a sommelier yelling at a busser telling him he is annoying with the questions that he would ask and he was stupid that's so inappropriate and unprofessional he should never speak to someone like that ever and I was seeing a lot of the managers walking around not smiling or greeting guests they looked depressed my server was amazing and the busser was fantastic I don't remember their names but one had an accent and the busser was a young looking kid I would only come back for their service
