ynYEgNimJOyb8dvyr9x0sA Went there last night 12/30/13.  They had the main dining area closed off for some reason and the place was busier than I have seen it usually.  There were 3 people working the small dining area, but it was like watching a 3 stooges movie.  They were unorganized.  It took quite some time for our waiter to get our order.  Right after that we thought we might go ahead and order an appetizer since everything was taking so long, we were afraid the food would too.  

Well the waiter brought a menu back for us to look at, but never came back until after our dinner was served by another waiter 45 minutes later.  We were out of drinks the whole time and when our food was served all of it was cold.  The only thing that wasn't was the La Potence and the only reason it wasn't cold is that it is served flambe table side.  We had made the mistake of promising our kids a dessert after dinner and ordered a sugar crepe and the Frangipane which is almond creme topped with vanilla ice cream.  After a 15 minute wait for these, the original waiter returned with the wrong dessert crepe, it was Crepe Flambe Grand Marnier.  We probably should have just sucked it up and accepted it, but we made the mistake of asking to get what we ordered.  10 minutes later it came out, the crepe was unevenly cooked.  

All in all this was very disappointing.  We had been here before a few times and service never knocked our socks off, but it was never this bad.  The meals were made incredibly average by the long time they had sat waiting to be picked up by the incompetent waitstaff.  Quite frankly, when the experience of getting a meal at a restaurant is this frustrating, it ruins the entire night.  This was the last time we will be going to Le Chalet.
