rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We visited Bouchon again for a friend's birthday. The food was amazing, as usual. There were some highlights and there were some that were OK. 

The highlights of our dinner were the following:

* Foie Gras Sauté -- Really delicious. They definitely know how to sear their foie gras to the right consistency. Highly recommend

* Escargots à la Bourguignonne  - Burgundy snails, parsley-garlic butter & Bouchon Bakery puff pastry. The escargots are heavenly. Highly recommend.

* Seared Scallops - The scallops are delicious and seasoned perfectly.

We also ordered the following. Each dishes below were good, but not great.

* Salade Maraîchère au Chèvre Chaud - watercress-endive salad, Fuji apples, Roquefort & walnuts with walnut vinaigrette
* Seared Ahi tuna - The seared ahi tuna is good but not great. I've had better seasoned ahi tuna elsewhere
* Lamb - The lamb is good, but I've had better seasoned lamb at Greek restaurants.
* Flatbread - The flatbread is also just OK

Overall, we had a solid meal and enjoyed the ambiance. The menu is good and their recipe is well tested, but wasn't quite as creative as some of the other restaurants.
