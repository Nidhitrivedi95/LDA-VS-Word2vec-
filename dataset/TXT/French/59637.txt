s1NqIkLMCFX6PuTk6wt6QA Tasty burgers and fries.  Loved mine with a root beer.   

They were accomodating to our baby, and provided a highchair. 

Decor is very retro-diner and a bit tired.... Having read reviews, I thought it was going to be diner decor but in a stylish way... but it's actually just diner decor in a leftover way.  But the food is good, and the crowd seemed to be steady, so it's still something good!
