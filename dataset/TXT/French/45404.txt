mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Let me start by saying this is a beautiful designed restaurant that is set up as an Open Kitchen/Sushi Bar. From your first glimpse of the red & black themed eatery you get a sense of something very different from everything you have grown accustomed to before. Secondly you notice that the service is very good they make you feel welcome & are on top of it all. The kitchen though being open is amazingly quiet you don't hear any of the usual noise that comes from an open kitchen.  The food is literally amazing edible art on a plate. Executive Chef Steve Benjamin is a character & very personable he is fun to watch as he orchestrates his staff in the kitchen. They have some of the best food I have had in the states without the fine dining stuffiness or dress code. Highly recommended if you have the opportunity you mush eat there.  We eat there every time we are in Vegas around a dozen times in a year.
