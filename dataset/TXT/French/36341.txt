I2LcbNXGsMb6zxh4-gmVHw this place breaks my heart every time. the service is so slow and so unattentive. they get my order wrong 8 out of 10 times.  i've gotten an incorrect order that went back to be corrected and then came out wrong again. it was hard for me to stay nice that night, mostly because they weren't even apologetic. 

but the food is so good that i have to keep coming back. get the garlic fries and the edemame. and save yourself the time and frustration by calling ahead for takout.
