pKiSzUlBBRNEdTML24piXA This place was amazing , and the staff very knowledgeable and friendly.  We ordered the mushrooms, the pancetta wrapped gnocchi (EXCELLENT), and the crab and lobster pizza.  Loved everything ..pizza is superb when you add a little heat to it and/OR the leftover amazing cheese sauce from the gnocchi.  For dessert ?  A must try..puffed pastry stuffed with mascarpone and blackberries served with a side of chocolate sriracha soup (so good I wanted to take a bath in it!!) .
Also highly recommended ..sleepy hollow old vine Pinot !
