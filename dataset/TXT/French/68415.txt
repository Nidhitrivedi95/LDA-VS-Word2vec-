vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q I went to two nice restaurants this vegas trip, Twist and the Cut, and twist won hands down. 

When you go to a nice establishment and treated like a queen when you first walk into the door it sets a great presidence for the rest of your meal. The hostess new our reservation when she saw our group size, was ready to take our coats and quickly sat us at our table facing the view of the strip. She even had a purse holder ready for the female guests. 

Once we ordered our drinks using their ipad, they gave us our menus and ample time to discuss our options. 

Our table got essentially every combination of the appetizer and meal option. Steak, lobster, pork, vegetarian and fish for the entrees and foie gras, crab, soup, cheese dish as the appetizer. all were amazing creation. They use various techniques from ice creamed blood sausage and cheese (two different dishes) to foams and gels with alcohol. Not only delicious but good conversation starters. 

Sounds like a small meal for the price, right? Well, they gave a ton of starters. We had the amuse bouche of a cucumber gel, squid ink biscuit, and three others that were all amazing spouts of flavor. And then bread. Each person received their own basket of bread. All were delicious. And they kept asking us if we wanted more. They each came out warm and wonderful. 

Through out our meal we were treated like royalty. A waiter was always watching our table to ensure we had everything we needed. Our plates cleared within a reasonable time (not too quickly, not too slowly) and cleaned our massive amounts of bread crumbs before each setting. 

It was just a fantastic experience. 

highly recommend for a date or with a group of friends.
