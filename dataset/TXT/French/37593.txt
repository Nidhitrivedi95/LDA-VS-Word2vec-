jA3xcba82t8x06H8NzG4VQ Amazing!!! We had great service and an absolutely fabulous meal! We got the brussel sprouts and the fingerling potatoes to start, both of which were delicious. For our entrées we got the fettuccine and the short ribs... The lamb in the fettuccine was wonderful and the short ribs melted in our mouths. Definitely would go back!
