bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg First time at Terrace.  We met some friends for Brunch and it was great.  Had the Chicken and Waffles with Fruit with a side of Hashbrowns.  Everything was great with the exception of the fruit.  Just disappointed in the quality.  Otherwise everything was perfect.  Will return.
