ytD9rJ-jcb8zMUCfiYCnFw I really would have missed this place had I not been trying so hard to look for it and I'm damn glad I did find it. Cafe Cherrier has a beautiful patio that wraps around the store and is nearly covered up by the abundance of plants and flowers which make it a great place to sit for brunch.

Our brunch was not too expensive (appx $10-14 / person) and the food was pretty good! I can personally attest for the smoked salmon crepe, the amount of cheese and the holandaise sauce with the salmon made it reaallly tasty. They have freshly squeezed juices which was a plus and their service was A+.
