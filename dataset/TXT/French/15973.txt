6x3zxKZ9GAu1HGH3fDbYyA Stopped in for brunch on a Sunday recently. Place looked beautifully kept and was pretty quiet this morning with only one or two other tables. The menu looked to have some really tasty brunch options. We ordered the eggs Benny and the "double bacon" hash. The Benny was about a 7/10, pretty average with good peameal served on a scone. The hash however was brutal. Way too many potatoes that were simply not cooked enough. It's like they were boiled but not finished to make them into breakfast potatoes. At least 3/4 of my dish was spuds. Otherwise it was tasty overall but there was barely a hint of the "double bacon" other than a couple of pieces of tasty peameal. To top it off my cucumber and tomato salad was swimming in the grease of the rest of my dish. Lots of potential here, just horrible execution.
