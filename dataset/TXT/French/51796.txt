I think it's an extra special touch that the (young, skinny, & talented) chef Gary La Morte came out to help serve & explain his version of  the food with our waiter, Ricardo [who's worked here 12 yrs].  We had the $16 escargot appetizer, $15 riesling, $50 filet of beef with shallots, $26 perigord truffle risotto half serving, & not on the menu $46 bouillabaisse with minimal broth.  All is a degustatory treat.  La fin is a long tray of candy petits fours.
