tCp1OkefhamXLeTnmEPUow Wow! What a great place this is. I was in town on business and was brought here for diner. Just happened to be during a record breaking week of amazing Spring weather. The place was packed! The patio bustling with happy patrons. We waited 10 minutes to be seated and started our meal with an Outremont Mojito, a twist on the classic using dark run rather than white and maple syrup instead of cane syrup. De-licious!

The menu is simple comfort food made well.... Sheapards pie, Mac and cheese, burgers, even mini pogo's for appies. They also have a clue tartares that looked amazing and some rockin salads. I landed on the lamb burger which was absolutely delectable. The fries were hand cut and cooked to perfection and came with home made mayo and ketchup for dipping. 

Although fully satisfied, I couldn't resist trying the "pudding chomeur" a childhood favorite. HEAVEN!

Go check it out. Well worth the wait if you don't have a reservation.
