KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Poor service completely ruins this restaurant. We brought a guest from out of town to Marche and we were treated so badly I won't be back. We went in for Sunday brunch, the place was almost empty, not a good first sign. We were seated at a table in the sun so we asked to move...that was our big mistake. We moved to a table on the upper patio and we were basically ignored from that point on. We had to flag down the waitress to get water and again to place our order. The drinks took a good 10-15 minutes to arrive, thats not an exaggeration. For a wine shop you would think they would know the difference between champagne and vouvray, but apparently not. So, after waiting they got the drinks incorrect. Had to flag down the waitress and correct the order, this took another 10 minutes. We were on the verge of leaving when a different person showed up at our table to be our waiter. He wasn't much better. The food was so-so, consistent with other reviews for this place. I'm not sure why they keep getting 4 star ratings. Must be the location. As a local who entertains visitors all the time, I was embarrassed by the service and food. Sad. Like I said in the beginning, I won't be back.
