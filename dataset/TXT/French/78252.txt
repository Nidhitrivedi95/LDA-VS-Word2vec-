YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Dishes were creative and flavors were spot-on. Two of our group had the scallops, which seem to be smoked before searing and are presented under a dome that helps them retain the smoky flavor. It was impressive. Linguini with clams was spicy and full of whole clams. A simpler dish but nicely done.
We didn't order appetizers, so everyone went crazy for dessert. Chocolate soufflés, brownie pops (more elegant than they sound), eclairs and beignets were flying around the table.
As a large group, we were seated in a niche to the side of the dining room and had privacy and quiet. Service was good and prices were fair. No, the portions are not gigantic but everything tasted great.
