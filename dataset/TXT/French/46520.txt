Their modern decor, laid back vibes and delectably prepared small plates has added another glowing example of Toronto's stunning food scene for me.

First off, we visited on a Thursday but wanted to share that they do $1 oysters and $1oz wine every Tuesday (amazing)... will 100% be back for that.

From a first look at the menu, it wouldn't strike me as a French resto as there are the familiar starters like oysters, kale salad and steak tartar. It's character develops a little more as you move down the menu on to the frog legs and snails. After that, mainly crowd pleasing dishes sprinkled with some French & Asian flair. Simple but kept me interested.

We decided on their appetizer special for the day which was a salmon pate (missed the actual name of this dish) BUT although nameless for me, it was really good and was bursting with creamy flavour of smoked salmon. For our main we ordered the half duck with crepes which the ensemble oddly reminded me of Chinese Peking duck. Nonetheless, the duck was really juicy and skin on the leg was perfectly crispy and well seasoned. 

Our service that night was also excellent and from the quality of food we had, I am looking forward to trying other more French inspired items on the menu next time.. All in all, really great spot for a cozy date night or a fun dinner with friends!
