kIW8IeTV3W1tS_q_WAU4wQ We went to Le Local for an early dinner when our parents came to visit. The food is really well made, fresh ingredients. Friendly and attentive staff. I am not crazy about the decor, but the place is definitely comfortable and pleasant.
After our meal we had some coffee, unfortunately their coffee is not good. Way too hot and bitter. But other than that I have no complains.
