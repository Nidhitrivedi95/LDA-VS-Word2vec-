rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Oh how I count the days until I can dine at Bouchon again. I used to have a party there while in town for NAB but alas our company wanted to try something new last year.  They have a fantastic private dining room for groups of 15 or smaller and a big one for larger groups. Their wine list is phenomenal and they make excellent pairings upon request. Although the company doesn't go, I always make sure to have at least one meal during my annual voyage to Vegas.
