Cons:  it's a little cramped & noisy.  There's also a strong chance that you'll end up sharing a table, if you're a smaller party.

Unfortunately, later that night, a group of people were celebrating a staff member's appearance on "Murdoch Mysteries".  They broadcast the show, on the main wall, cranked the volume, and cheered every time their friend appeared. 

Although, it would be an exciting thing, it was unfortunately oft-putting - for the remaining customers, finishing their meals.   However, it was obviously a one-off occasion (hopefully).
