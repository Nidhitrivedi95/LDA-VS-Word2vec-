rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Bouchon was okay.
Nothing interesting to write about...
5 oz of foie gras was a little much for 2 people.
I had the gnochi and my hubby had the croq madame.
I had high hopes and I wanted to write the best dinner ever... but it wasn't... Oh well.
Hard little place to find..... the signs are not clear.... bouchon (up sign) meaning upstairs for me.... and not one elevator only out of 2-3 elevators going up.
Complicated :) I brough  my left over  foie gras back  all the way to california :)
