4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I forgot about this pathetic place. Maybe it's just me, maybe it was just a bad Friday night...maybe it was just a terrible suggestion. but in the end, the lesson to be learned is that no one can upsell a cheapa$$ cut of cow (ie skirt steak) to a carnivore and throw in potato leftovers ( I mean LOUSY french fries)  on the dish to make it appealing. 

This establishment is why I hate trying new places out.. all the hype.. ohh the food is good, it rocks, we should try it.. yah yay yah.mmbop .. whatevers! 

NO, don't get the SKIRT STEAK, no matter WTF they called it, it's friggin carne asada! but REAL carne asada TASTES good! 
/ end PSA. 
That is all...

next time it's Del Friscos d-bags... no and's if's or but's!
