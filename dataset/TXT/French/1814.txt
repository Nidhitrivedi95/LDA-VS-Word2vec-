0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw I cannot begin to describe this place. It's located next door to Joe Beef, and has much of the same decor styles and ambiance. 

The breakfast foie gras was hands down the best dish I have EVER eaten. It was like the first time I was given food. Plated on organic maple syrup, the entire creation  of breakfast perfection has ruined me. It's all I can think about. It has single handedly set the bar so high that I cannot imagine any other restaurant or food item coming close. The yolkey envelopment over the  creamy foie gras in combination of the fresh and local bagel was also just sublime. 

We also had the lobster spaghetti which was also incredible. I will be back, that I can assure you.
