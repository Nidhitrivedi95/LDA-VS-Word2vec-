AHosGBveeXx9YjsQvdJgeg Went here on date-night, and the place was oh so romantic. I give the food 3-stars, but the ambiance deserves a star all on its own. What can I say, I like my food messy and ethnic. Bentley's food is pretty and rich. We ordered the crabcake for appetizers, I ordered the Taste of Hawaii, which was fresh sea bass that night, and my man ordered a steak. The presentation was lovely, and the service was superb. Think Anthony Hopkins in Remains of the Day. 

We had the best view in the house in my opinion, facing the city skyline. We got there at 8 p.m. and by the middle of our dinner, we saw the sun set.
