gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Had a wonderful 3 course meal and cocktail with a travel Zoo coupon in a spectacular setting and view at the top of the Palms. We came around 6 and were seated at a table with a view of the entire strip. We started out with a signature martini that was fantastic, rimmed around the edge with fine baker's sugar providing a sweet start and sour finish. The chef's appetizer was lobster bisque and braised pineapple topped with fois gras... very tasty. Our salad was the carpaccio and steak tartare with herb Salad, dijon aïoli, topped with a quail egg and caraway crackers. Really yummy and nice sized portion. I had the fish which was fantastic and tasted like butter. My husband had the steak and was very happy with the flavor and preparation. Dessert for me was almond ice cream with a lacy cookie and fruit. And btw, the wait staff was fantastic, friendly, swift and professional. A real steal with the coupon. Go at dusk.  A must do for the local and traveler alike.
