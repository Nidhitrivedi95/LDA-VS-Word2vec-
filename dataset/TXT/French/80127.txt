And it wasn't a ridiculously large portion so a friend and I could share it and still have room for a burger or two. Speaking of which, I had 2 small burgers (mini burgers) and they were delicious. I got all the toppings on it and the bread it was on was so good and you could tell it had been made fresh! There were only 3 guys working when I went and they were serving people very fast! Although this place feels like a little broom closet inside, it packs a lot of flavor!
