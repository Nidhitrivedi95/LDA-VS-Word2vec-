XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w Stopped by during my layover in Phoenix hoping for a place to enjoy a drink and charge my phone. I was seated quickly and the server came over right away. He was very gluten free aware and helped me navigate to the steak salad with the mustard champagne, instead of blue cheese dressing. 

I enjoyed a couple of 11.00 house glasses of wine while I charged my phone and ate. There are chargers all around the restaurant, pretty much at every table, which was awesome. The salad was ok, iceberg lettuce can only be so appetizing. The steak and dressing were tasty, it wasn't till I was almost done with the salad that I realized they hadn't put the crumbled blue cheese on it. Apparently they assumed if I couldn't have the dressing the cheese itself was also off limits. They brought me a little and I enjoyed it with the remainder of my salad.

Salad was a good portion and about 16.00. Overall portions were good on both wine and food. Service good and very prompt. Price expensive, but hey, it's airport food. 

Atmosphere is nice with comfortable booths, high top tables and a bar with tv. Also lovely windows overlooking the runway. I'd certainly stop in here again on another layover.
