4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I would have given them 5 stars, but then I started thinking about all my visits there and then i started taking the stars away.

I have been here quite a few times because it WAS one of my favorite steak restaurants here in town and its quite affordable.
First time I tried Mon Ami, we got seated at the patio and it was perfect day to sit outside. 
I ordered a Filet Minot merlot and it was pretty dang great.  It came with frites (almost like fries) but crunchier.  I just fell in love with the place. (Hence, I wanted to give it five stars)

Then stars started going down:
I came here with friends (group of 4-7) a couple of times and I must say the service was absolutely horrible.  
One Time: They treated us like we were there to make trouble and always forgot any requests we asked.  Also,  they kept getting our orders mixed up and when we finally got our food, one of my friends order was completely wrong.  They did not even apologize to her.   We had to keep flagging them down to refill our waters & wine.  We couldnt wait to leave the place and it took our server a long time to get the check even though we asked for it like FIVE TIMES! One of my friends even left our server a little note on the receipt how badly he treated us. 

Anyways:  
I usually order the steak classique with merlot butter (medium rare) and I always enjoy their steaks it never cease to impress me how good it is.  


Tip: I always put in a request to get a carrot salad, anyone who goes here should try the carrot salad! its really delicious! 
 Always make sure you have reservations because every single time i go to Mon Ami, it is packed & make sure youre whole party is there because they will not sit you unless everyone is present.
