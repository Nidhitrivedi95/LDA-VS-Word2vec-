xNnZ5ksBY1gwwTV2Btb4Ag I came here at the recommendation of a friend after being unable to secure a reservation at Au Pied de Cochon for my last night in Montreal, I'm pretty happy about this choice.
As I came with a large group, I had the chance to sample almost every item on the menu.  The seafood appetizer platter is a good choice, you get to sample 4 kinds raw seafood: the oysters were delightful, halibut crudo had the right amount of sweet and spicy taste, and the lobster bisque surprised me as to how good lobster bisque can be when done right (the previous one I've tried was so awful I did not take more than a bite).  Out of the main courses tried, I liked my selection of the rabbit leg: it was very tender, with a great sauce, and served with kohlrabi and snap pea salad.  BF's dish came with 2 huge fried braised beef ravioli, with side of 2 foie gras medallions, == decadent.
One mishap with the service was that the waitress had forgotten about a friend's order of steak tartare, she apologized profusely and brought the dish within 5 minutes.  Other than that, service was everything you could ask for.
Apparently celebrities like this place too.  The people in my party recognized 2 men sitting behind our table as 2 Quebec stars, I have no clue who they are.
