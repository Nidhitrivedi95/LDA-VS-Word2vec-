78TC3sZSYBzBsSJ0z5pyhw Food was good.  I mean, nothing too special.  The place was a bit fancy with their nice water glasses.  Service wasn't too slow, although we were a group of 12 people.  The atmosphere is really nice: dim lights, decorative walls, and even a small fountain.

What makes this place more special is the waiters and waitresses that sing.  Our waitress was one of the singers, and she sang with 2 other waitress.  We got to see another performance before with a waiter and a waitress.  They all had stunning voices, and performed beatifully.  I bet singing was a requirement for the job.  And I bet they get tons of tips too.
