-unEKbRspO6OuEaPdmRywg I visited Montreal with a friend last week and this place turned out to be our favorite. We spotted the beautiful Hotel Le St-James building on our way from dinner - it was impossible not to stop by to look what it is like inside. We ended up having a couple of martinis at the bar here-the drinks were superb. The restaurant is beautiful, the stuff is extremely professional and nice. XO has the sophisticated vibe of the New York City speakeasies so it is perfect for a classy night out.
