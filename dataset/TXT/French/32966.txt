Huge plates of speciality poutines seem to be a hallmark of this place. Right in the heart of Montreal's Gay Village.

I had the smoked meat poutine, which seemed like regular poutine with slices of ham. I'm not the biggest poutine fan in the world, but I like to have it every once in a while. It tasted fine. I can usually eat a lot, but the small plate I ordered was huge and I couldn't finish it all there. 

A gripe - we went on a slow day, and yet service was quite slow.
