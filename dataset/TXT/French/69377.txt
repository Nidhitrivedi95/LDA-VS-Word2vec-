WDzU-miZGQMADcWp-BZEoA Their udon noodles here are homemade, they also sell it for you to bring home to cook.

Service is excellent, it's really neat that they give you a bib to put on when you order the curry noodles so that you could be a little messy.

They also serve sashimi and sushi here, but a little pricey for me to try, but the next table ordered it and it looked pretty fresh.

The amount of curry was acceptable and it tasted delicious!
