4cWrtMvfj-tomyEPgP7KFg I dig the melting pot, i mean, its fun. Fondue=fun. This was another  "Yay my birthday is during restaurant week!" dinner for me. The cheeses, meat course and salad are good but lets be honest that dessert is where its at. Id get all 3 courses as dessert if i could.   A big pot of chocolate and then cheesecake, rise crispies, bananas, strawberries, red velvet cake and marshmallows all to dip into it. Heavenly is an understatement. 
I also dig that your in control of your own cooking times. So what if i cook my steak for 10 seconds...rare is good yo...
Going with a large group is smart. Then you can really sample a lot of the stuff on the menu. Our party had 8 peeps in it so we got 3 different cheeses, cooking styles and  chocolates. Service was aiiiiiight considering it was a large party, but it coulda been better. I normally wouldn't be able to afford more than one course here but at $30 for everything during restaurant week it's a hella great deal.
