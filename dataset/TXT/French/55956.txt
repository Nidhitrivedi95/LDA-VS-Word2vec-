rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I wish I could add more stars! So amazing my husband and I went there for brunch twice during our 5 day trip to Vegas. Beautiful restaurant in a beautiful resort. I highly recommend eating ousts with- it is worth the wait. My husband got the salmons eggs Benedict and I got the omelet of the day- both fabulous. Of course, start with the fried donuts with Nutella and jam! Service is top notch and everything was simply perfect both days!! Can't wait to go back!
