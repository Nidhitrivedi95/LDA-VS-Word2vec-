You can sit wherever you like, or wait until one of their hosts escorts you, whichever you prefer. One of the reasons why I love Toronto's Nespresso boutique in Yorkville is because it has such a high ceiling! Personally, I love high ceilings because they can really change up a room's atmosphere and style. It makes me more relaxed.

The waiter or waitress brings some ice water with lemon for you to drink while you look at the menu. 

If you're familiar with Nespresso's coffee lines, they offer all of their types available which differ based on the intensity, key aromatic note, and size of cup. There is also a decaffeinated version for those who prefer decaf. 

According to my husband, the coffee tastes amazing. Since we don't like acidic tasting coffee, Nespresso is a good fit for us. The price of the drinks at Nespresso are more expensive than those at independent or local cafes, but we tend to still go  to Nespresso for a variety of reasons. 

As for me, the dulce le leche coffee was great. I usually get their hazelnut hot chocolate coffee, which is equally good, but sometimes I prefer something with caramel instead of chocolate. This dulce le leche coffee was perfect. For serious coffee drinkers, it wouldn't suffice. As my husband always says, "too sweet!"
