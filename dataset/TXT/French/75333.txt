y8Y8l5MVX58gIUCgJLm2jQ As many of those who've reviewed, I too arrived here by accident. Next door had a line around the corner. So my party of 5 decided we didn't want to eat brunch by dinner time lol it was around 11 am and only had a few tables available. Immediately we're seated and given a cold jug of water while our husbands parallel parked the car.  We ordered mimosas all the way around the table (even though I truly ordered a Bellini, a mimosa was close enough since she made them strong). We noticed this restaurant was slowly but surely getting more and more customers and worried this smaller restaurant would  become slower with service-as there was only 2 waitresses. The menu was all in French- if you're a local this isn't a surprise to you. But the waitress was happy to translate all of it. Not very elaborate with the menu choices. There were 4 different choices on the menu. A granola and yogurt option, waffle and fruit option, a standard what I'd call an American breakfast with choice of; meat, egg, bread, potato, fruit/salad, and coffee, and lastly what seemed to be their showcase item, bennies! 4/5 opted for the bennies. I chose the in house smoked salmon benny. My friends opted for the sausage. Each came with salad, fruit, and what we'd call home fries. I think we all agreed later that the potatoes were way too salty. Besides the salty potatoes everyone loved their brunch and felt like prices were very much reasonable ($13-$17CA). Our waitress even gave us some tips on what to do later that day, she was super attentive and kept up with our frequent refills. All in all I'm glad we went with this establishment.
