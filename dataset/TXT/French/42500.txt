lFva3eDk1GRvJAWKknQKig Have been coming here for years even before it was a French restaurant.  The same cute, cozy, inviting family vibe is present.  Super friendly and accommodating.  The food is very good for the price.  Everything seasoned perfectly and cooked just right.  I came back mainly because of the tempura ice cream (currently a secret menu item from when they were a Japanese restaurant).  Decor is nothing new but I like it as it is nostalgic to me.  Some may call it dated and I can see why, but I think it's perfect.  Great to see this little gem is still alive and well :) been coming here on and off for over 25years!

Side note: just had the tempura ice cream.  Still no other attempt from any other place even comes close to the tempura ice cream here.  Yes, ACTUAL deep fried ice cream.  Look at the pics.  Remember in a Ratatouille when Anton Ego eats the ratatouille and gets transported to his childhood?  The tempura ice cream here is my ratatouille.  :)
