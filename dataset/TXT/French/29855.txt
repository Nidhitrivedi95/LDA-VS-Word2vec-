FJMMPL3pxAPYGEPB0Hwlhw I've been here on two occasions and in between they had changed the menus. First time around my experience was excellent. They had at the time a butternut squash ravioli which was amazing. That is now gone and replaced with a standard cheese ravioli. Still tasty because of the cheese and sauce used, but not quite as good. The serving size was terribly unsatisfying, which is unreasonable given the price charged.  But that's what happens when you're located in a Ritz. Decor and ambience are nice, so I guess that's what you pay for.  Service is courteous and professional, but the second time around it was strangely slow.

Bottom line is that the food is pretty good, just doesn't do the price justice. Doesn't matter that it's in the Ritz. All in all, personally, I'd rather head up to King Street and find something there.
