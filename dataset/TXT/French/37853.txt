jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA This hidden gem is my new favorite!  I have tried brunch, lunch and happy hour. 

Service is wonderful and  every item I've ordered has been, well.......Devine

From the fresh hot bread served to the table to decadent desserts, it is a winner!

Daily happy hour and lunch specials let everyone have a treat if a meal here, no matter the size of you wallet.  

Patio seating available too
