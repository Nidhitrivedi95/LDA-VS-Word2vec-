aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I was in line at Carlo's Bakery for about 15 minutes and had moved about five feet. "Is this really happening?! How could a system possibly be this inefficient?!" Having more than 70 feet to go, I left outside to find a map of where I could find another bakery. NFL Sports bookings were going badly yesterday, and my buddies were going to need an emotional pick me up. Lo and behold, Bouchon was 20 feet away!

What I like about this place is that the treats are very affordable and not horrific Vegas prices. The strawberry and smores cupcakes were massive and comforted sorrows of a bad start for the NFL season. ($4) The chocolate chip cookies were chewy and delicious. ($3) 

Macarons, like anywhere, are expensive. Some of them are bland and don't have flavors that shine (raspberry and pistachio), but some are perfect and deliciously rich, like chocolate, caramel, and vanilla. I highly recommend those three.

This place makes a nice midday treat if you are at the Venetian!
