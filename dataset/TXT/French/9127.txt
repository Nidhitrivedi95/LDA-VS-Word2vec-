4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We found this restaurant while looking for a place near Planet Hollywood as we had tickets for a show there. With rather modest expectations, this place was a find! 
We sat inside as it was cool and windy outside and U am glad we did. Decorated as a local French neighborhood restaurant, with no views of the casino, you feel like you are really there.
Billy our server, was fun and helpful with the menu options. We started with drinks, me a Manhattan and Lisa, a martini. Both were perfect.
I ordered the Ahi tuna and unlike many places that overlook it, they seared it, with a rare center. Perfect. Billy, suggested a Bordeaux wine by the glass that finished the meal.
We liked it so much, we are going back in Sunday for the Beef Wellington special!
