4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw As a New Yorker who loves food,  I am sad to say this place fell short. I went based on a friend's recommendation:  
1. Steak Bernaise was cold and not tender
2. Escargot and Brie were decent, a bit too much pesto for the first
3. At least our waitress was nice ! 

Perhaps its the location near the fountains that makes it popular but I would save your $$$ for something less touristy and better quality!!! I hear Roy's fusion is good and zagat rated so we may try that next!
