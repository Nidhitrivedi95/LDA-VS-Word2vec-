EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g This restaurant is fantastic overall! 

I have been looking for the restaurant like this in Toronto...finally found one!
The only thing is that we had to wait a couple months to finally visit this restaurant after making a reservation. 

The service is great and the food is excellent with creativity that you don't see much in Toronto. 

I would love to visit again sometimes in the spring, summer and fall when the menu changes?
