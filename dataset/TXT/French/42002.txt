Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w The wife & I hit this place up for lunch twice on our most recent Montreal visit.  We were staying Vieux Montreal for the first time as opposed to just walking through as we had in the past and we excited to find this place.  It really encapsulated what I love about the city, you feel like you got away to Europe with the obscene airfare.

The food was very good and the service was excellent, the gentleman waiter was very personable and entertaining.  It took my 4th trip to Montreal to get here, but it's now a regular stop.
