JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g Was looking forward to eating here, got there and they were busy and waited 10 minutes for a table which was fine. Ordered coffee which was great and our breakfast, it took over an hour to get our food. I don't mind waiting but over an hour for breakfast food is not good. The food when we got it was very good and I would have given 5 stars but that's just too long to wait for an order.
