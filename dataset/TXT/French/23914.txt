cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Before dinner at PDC, I did not believe the term " too much foie gras" 

Our 1st dish was Foie Gras with bacon and fig (a special that night which I thought was only a small appetizer, but it was actually an entry size dish). The foie gras were perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth, but the fig was a little too strong and made the entire dish a bit too sweet.  By the end of the 1st dish, I was already pretty satisfied. And then our main course came:

Mine was Cured Foie Gras & Boudin Tart (how big can a tart be? right? wrong!! this is not your regular tart,  it is meant to be shared by 4 very hungry people!!).  This dish was probably, by far,  the richest food I have ever had in my entire life!! With tons of Foie Gras AND blood sausages on a huge tart.  Although the dish tasted really great, I could only finish 1/6 of the "pie" and I felt... defeated.. by FOIE GRAS?! 

My husband ordered duck in the can which comes in a regular can, but I was surprised how much duck and foie gras were packed in that can.  Unfortunately, he was defeated too, left half of the foie gras and duck untouched. The duck, in my opinion, was bland. I did not try his foie gras though (obviously)...

We also ordered the duck fat fries, they tasted just like the regular fries. 

For dessert, we ordered the Lemon Meringue Pie and Panna Cotta, the panna cotta was outstanding, pie was just all right. 

We will definitely return, and next time PDC, we  - will- be - prepared!
