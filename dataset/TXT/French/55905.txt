rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Thomas Keller, you are fantastic; and I can say the same about Bouchon. Came for brunch. Bouchon is located on the second floor of the Venetian. Beautiful, bright atmosphere. A great way to end a weekend in Vegas. Please note that they do not take reservations for brunch.

- Bouchon French Toast/   Layers of brioche, custard and apples. Light, moist bread pudding consistency. Indulgent and sweet.

- Escargot a la Bourguignonne/   Topped with a fluffy puff pastry which was a nice compliment to the buttery escargot.

- Pastry Basket/  Choose 4 pastries. I recommend the cheese danish and raspberry beignets. Heaven.

Recommended for brunch!
