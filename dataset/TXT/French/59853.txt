sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ Dining at e' is a life changing experience.
It took me months to get a reservation that would accommodate everyone I wanted to share this dinner with. 

It's not just the food that's amazing it's the atmosphere, and being able to openly communicate with the staff about what's happening. The dining room is small and intimate with seating for only 8 guests. Walls are lined with unique art and card catalog drawers which are actually functional for the staff. 

There were more courses than I can remember. Each dish is elegantly prepared in front of you as if you are watching a foodie cirque show!

If dining as a couple or even as friends I suggest getting one of each: the alcohol and non alcohol paring to compliment your dinner. The non alcohol beverages were incredible! 

Take the time to make a reservation, spend the money and ENJOY!
