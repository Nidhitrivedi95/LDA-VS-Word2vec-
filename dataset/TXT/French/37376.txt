j0baDQfMAGDm_QGdFMmb-Q Don't order the low end wine...awful. We have never been in a restaurant that did not offer to replace the wine with another if it didn't taste right. It was inferred we should have ordered something better, and "here is a small taste of another wine you can order next time"  Moules were good, French onion soup so-so, but overall we were disappointed and probably won't go back
