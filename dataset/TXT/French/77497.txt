YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g The Spanish prepared chicken was some of the best  chicken I've had anywhere.  Very very good.  We also had the duck, as the reviews were good.  The duck was tasty, but the chicken was outstanding.  Also ordered the chocolate lavender cake and it was chocolate, but not overpowering, with nice soft lavender molten middle.  Chef Alex came to visit with us, as well as our waiter, Manfred from Austria.  Manfred was an ex chef from New York, but is enjoying waiting and visiting with customers--while he can golf in Las Vegas instead of be in the kitchen.  Overall, a very nice dinner in a contemporary setting.  The wines looked marvelous, but I was not able to partake this night.
