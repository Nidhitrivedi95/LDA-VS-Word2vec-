rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We were staying at the Venetian and came downstairs to Bouchon for breakfast at 11:00 since it's convenient. Only to our disappointment, breakfast is over at 10:30. BOO! This is Vegas people! 11:00 is early for us, especially from partying the night before... Sigh...

They showed us their lunch menu and there were very limited items: 3 desserts, salads, and sandwiches. I got the chicken salad and my boyfriend got some sandwich with a crazy name. 

His sandwich was okay, but my salad wasn't great. It tasted dirty and the bread was stale. 

3 stars because the service was really good, my boyfriend liked his sandwich, the interior is nice, and you get a view of the pool. I guess seeing the pool could be a pro or a con. Luckily no gross looking people were outside waddling around while we were eating. :) lol So mean..I know...
