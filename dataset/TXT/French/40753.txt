kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ Excellent place for foodies. Everything is extremely well carried out. The grilled artichoke appetizer is a must. Great smoky flavor and just the right amount of seasoning. Extremely flavorful. The menu ranges from lower priced burgers/sandwiches to higher end steak/fish entrees. If you're looking for great seafood, don't expect it in Phoenix. It's going to be frozen. Service was over the top excellent. We'll definitely be back to celebrate with friends in the near future.
