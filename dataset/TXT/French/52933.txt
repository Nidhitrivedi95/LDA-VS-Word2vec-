QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Came here on our second to last day in Montreal, after having been here for a week and not having one exciting meal.

The food was amazing!! Started with fresh calamari, followed by the rack of lamb with goat cheese and it didn't disappoint. Ended the night off with some warm homemade apple pie that was the cherry on top for a great evening in a beautiful restaurant. 

I will definitely be back on my next visit during the summer!
