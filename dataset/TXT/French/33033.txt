H9pG0BNhqID2MTj8KnY3jQ I've been here twice now, every time I've tried different meals and appetizers. Omu rice has been the best (life changing!), and I always get the Kara-age (fried chicken). This time they had a French onion soup special, best I've had. The chefs at Coo know how to prepare beautiful and delicious food.

It's still not crazy well known yet, so go treat your tastebuds before the lineups start happening.
