JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g This place is a decent Cleveland interpretation of a French cafe. The menu is populated with a number of traditional French dishes that you would expect (escargot, cassoulet, croque madame/monsieur, pate, french cheeses, etc) along with some interesting crepes. The prices are low and the service is adequate. The building is sort of a hole in the wall in Ohio City, nothing to write home about. the food didn't blow me out of the water but I'd probably go back if I were in the neighborhood.
