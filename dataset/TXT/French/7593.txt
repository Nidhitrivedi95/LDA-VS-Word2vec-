4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I wanted to LOVE Mon Ami Gabi, I really did. They seemed very gluten free-friendly with a huge gf menu online. At the restaurant, not so much. The gluten free bread they served was two pieces of Udi's Gluten Free Bread that I buy every week at the store grilled with butter, NOT impressed. Ordered the Steak Classique which was cooked as ordered, the butter sauce was flavorful but would have liked it on the side better. Frittes were okay, a little overdone and very hard to eat. Husband had the Char special with pureed asparagus which he liked. I was most disappointed in the service. Server had NO personality, was not light with us when we tried to have conversation and seemed to care less we were there. He refused to take empty plates off the table, the bread plate didn't get cleared until the end of the meal (pet peeve). Felt like we were rushed in and out and were stuck at a tiny table in a dark corner (dark enough you couldn't read the menu or SEE your food).
