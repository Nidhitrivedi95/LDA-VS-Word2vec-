COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw My absolute favorite restaurant! Pamplemousse is for lovers, it's classic romantic ambiance is unlike anywhere else. It is small, cozy, dimly lit, intimate, and the food and service is pristine without being stuffy. No paper menus-- the menu is recited by the staff tableside. The crudite, perfectly done duck confit, and profiteroles are all amazing, and the classic hard boiled eggs served in giant French country baskets in the shape of roosters are slightly paradoxical (as is the eclectic gay icon decor), which all add to its whimsical vibe. Substantial wine selection and knowledgeable sommeliers. Veg or fish option available (usually pasta or halibut). Parking is limited for Vegas, but there is abundant street parking. Ditch the strip and take someone you love here immediately!
