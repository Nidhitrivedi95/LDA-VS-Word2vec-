SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ The Blue Door is hands down some of the best food in the greater Cleveland/Akron area. Yes,  they serve primarily brunch with an unmatched level of care for not only preparation but for sourcing the best ingredients the Great Lakes region has to off. For example, their seemly simple strawberry lemonade was crafted with local strawberries and hand juices organic lemons; you could just feel how proud the owner was when he told me this. I am proud to patronize the Blue Door and will continue to give them 100% of my support.
