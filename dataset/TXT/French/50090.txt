OVrNItYaf-AWNGgeJA1Tsw Cafe Cancan is the Perfect Example of the Trendy, Instagram Worthy Restaurant with is Pastel Colours and Amazing Patio at the back, all the signs for theses new restaurant all about style and no substance. But thank GodRamsay, i was wrong. CanCan delivered an amazing modern french classic Brunch with a succulent Croque-Madame that brought me right back to Quebec City in a Second. The Bread Pudding French Toast is also quite creative and delicious.

Average customer service in an amazing Romantic Pastel Ambiance. Perfect for a first date or meeting your new in-law. Set to impress with a humble side to it.
