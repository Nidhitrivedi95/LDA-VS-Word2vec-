My brother and I went small and ordered the French Onion Soup and it was really good, but needing a hint of salt. French fries were good with black pepper aioli. We also shared the bone marrow with oxtail jam and it was like meat candy on a crostini.

The cocktails were also very good and so was the service. Would definitely come back if I ever come back to Vegas.
