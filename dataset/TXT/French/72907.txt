XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q GO HERE! Seriously, that gambling budget you have, spend it at these tables instead. 

Service: What you expect from a place like this. Different bread and dessert combination for our table of 4, server remembered exactly what we each wanted. Only delay was the main entree because we ordered the hen (whole hen) that takes a while to cook. 

Food: Yes, yes, and yes. Forget whatever food you had tasted before. From the butter to the foie gras, better versions than any other place I've ever been to. The bread was just medium to transport more butter to my mouth =D. 

Price: I don't drink so that affects the bill a lot. Expect at least $300 per person, this place can easily run into the thousands of dollars if you want. 

Overall: Most expensive meal of my life, BEST meal of my life. Totally worth it.
