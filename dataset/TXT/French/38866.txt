Bad customer service, will not be returning due to service. Over priced. We ended up spending $40 on small brkfst and coffee; not even worth it. 
Also the people behind the counter should be wearing hair nets. One man had long hair and a big nasty looking beard and he was not wearing any hair nets, yet he was handling our food.
