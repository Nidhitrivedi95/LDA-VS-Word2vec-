HL6ZzGF7V-KDaU0zziHyEA Beautiful ambiance. Service was excellent, our waiter was extremely friendly. We ordered the pan fried foie gras- melt in your mouth magic. Our entrees; bass, venison and squab. Everything was cooked to perfection, squab was my favorite. And then came desserts, the Madeleines were soooo good, the praline mousse... Mmm mmm good. Keep in mind this place is pricey but you are paying for Daniel Boulud "experience" so ambiance, service and high end French cuisine. Good spot for an anniversary dinner or a special occasion.
