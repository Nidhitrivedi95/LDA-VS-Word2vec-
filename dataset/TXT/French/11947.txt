4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Horrible customer service. Do not bring a large group. The salesperson that "helped" me in advance did nothing at all for me but cause frustration. The management doesn't care if you want to give them business, so my advice is don't. I arrange group dinners and meetings for my company and I know where I'll never bring them again when we're meeting in Vegas.

Food was eh, nothing amazing that would make me change my mind about the poor customer service.
