_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ Fabulous food, presentation & service, lovely view, superb winelist....what more can I say? My boyfriend took me there on my birthday.  The lobster appetizer had sold out but that was no problem because everythig on the menu was appealing.   I decided on 2 appetizers instead of a main.  We enjoyed a wonderful 2005 burgundy which is not easy  to come by!   The dessert menu is fun to read...and I am sure all their desserts are devine.....but i don't eat dessert!
