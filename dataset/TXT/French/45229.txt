mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q The Atelier concept is a casual-ish dining experience next door to the regular Robuchon restaurant at the MGM. Most diners sit at the bar in this very intimate and smallish restaurant, to be spectators in the preparation of their food. Lots of activity in this fully open kitchen that does a nice job immersing the guests. It was even awarded a Michelin Star. I believe its big brother next door has two stars. Sadly this is where the good news ends.

Laughably mediocre food that makes one wonder if Michelin reviewers are on the take, or just blinded by Robuchon's celebrity. I left wondering how I had just paid a bundle for food that wasn't even very good. Of particular note are the mussels which failed to even register as decent. This restaurant may be owned by one of the most lauded chefs in the world, but the food sends a clear message that he is a world away from this kitchen.

To be avoided. Plenty of better food options in Vegas at all price points.
