O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q Really wanted to love this place as it is close to my house. But it was really disappointing!   We ordered their rock shrimp, salmon and tuna chips, ny strip steak, and a few other items.  Main entrees were not brought out together.  There was 3-4 minutes between the the three items.  Very disappointing.  Will not go their again.
