aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I am surprised I only visited this place once when the elevator to our room was directly in front of this bakery stand! Of course, on our first trip there, I ordered a bunch of sweets to last me the weekend.

I was happy with everything I ordered - the strawberry rhubarb pie/tart, the strawberry croissant, and the carrot cake cream cheese sandwich cookies. I took a bite of the valrhona chocolate cupcake and it was very delicious. I wanted to buy a ton of the carrot cake sandwiches on the way back home but I kind of knew I'd eat them all at the airport so opted not to.
