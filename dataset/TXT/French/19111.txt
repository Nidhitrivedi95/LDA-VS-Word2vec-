AQ-H-lvkoB8DOFYdRmkceA Went to Sababa Grille when they were closing and they directed me to Village Steakhouse. It was an awesome experience. The staff were fine the atmosphere nice the food was incredible. I may keep a dairy kitchen but I'm not a vegetarian and I don't often have chances to dine as I did that evening in Las Vegas. I wish the SF Bay Area had something like this. Its expensive but it was worth it and I felt compelled to give a generous tip. Roger was very helpful. I had the 20 oz rib-eye. I was concerned that it was going to be too big. It was HUGE but it was so good and so choice that the next day i found myself dwelling on the 26 oz. Next time, B"H. I wanted to try the buffalo but I figured the ribeye was a sure bet. I was correct and it was prepared to order and to perfection. My friend had the duck breast and she was quite pleased with it. The place is GREAT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! None of the desserts that they offered called out to me though. Always room for improvement but I highly recommend the Village Steakhouse.   Supervised glatt kosher.  Go and enjoy you will not be disappointed.
