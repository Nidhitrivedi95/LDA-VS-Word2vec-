We take all of our houseguests here for the almond croissants, and it is typically one of the highlights of their visits (and we eat well around these parts--I don't starve them). 

If you're thinking of trying a regular croissant or a chocolate croissant, don't. Get the almond croissant instead. You won't be disappointed.
