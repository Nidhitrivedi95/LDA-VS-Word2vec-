4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Got the Steak Classique which didnt seem like anything special. The quality of the steak was average and felt like I could make it at home, but the maitre d'hotel butter that was on top was pretty good. I think I was deciding between this and my usual choice of steak which is the Filet, but it was lunch time so it seemed more proper to get this dish. Should've been safe and went with the filet. Their fries were interesting but not amazing, got kind of oily near the end.

The item I remember most would probably be the french onion soup, or the 
Onion Soup Au Gratin which was baked with gruyere cheese. That was full of cheesy deliciousness, one of the best french onion soups I've had in awhile.

I also tried my friend's Steak Au Poivre (brandy peppercorn) and Steak Bordelaise (caramelized onion & red wine sauce), and ultimately their sauces were satisfying, but I just didnt enjoy the steak itself.

Also, the two guys I was with were both wearing tanks and had to wear a huge white t over because apparently a tall t is so much better.

Overall, not bad but maybe I should give it another shot before jumping to conclusions. If you do come here definitely try the French Onion Soup because that was what made a lasting impression.
