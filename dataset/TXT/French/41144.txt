kFsWang2-Svujg3ldi7BiQ Great patio, good food.  My interest was piqued by the unique cuisine--Alastian--which is, as you'd expect, a melange of German and French. 

We ordered two flambees--smoked salmon and zucchini--and the cheese plate.  Everything was good, although I would echo other reviews that the cheese and meat boards don't come quite as stocked as you'd hope.  The service was good and the overall Eurocharm-atmosphere makes the patio a nice date spot.  

I'm eager to try some of their more German-influenced dishes to get a sense of how those two cuisines interact.  Spaetzle is on the menu, sacre blau!
