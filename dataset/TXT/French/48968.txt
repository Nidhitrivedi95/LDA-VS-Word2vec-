OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ Another great experience here. Delicious Brie and I also enjoyed the salad that I got. We have found our yearly Valentine's day spot!  I also love that they don't rush you. For a small restaurant, they don't mind if you linger and sip on your glass of wine for an additional hour.
