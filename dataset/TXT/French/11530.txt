4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My wife and I had dinner here.  Make sure you have reservations.  It gets rather packed.  The interior is really nice.  It's incredibly dark inside though.  The noise level is rather high.  We both had the hanger steaks and frites.  The plating was awful (compared to what they show on their pictures).  I must say they were very delicious though.  I ordered medium-well and it was spot on.
