Online reservation was an ease, left a note asking for a table by the window for our wedding anniversary celebration.  When we arrived we were greeted warmly and brought to our requested table, followed by complimentary champagne and congratulation, what a nice gesture!  We ordered Crispy-fried Calamari, Shrimp Bon Bon, Steak Frites, and Chef's Daily Fish (Sea Bass) from the simple one-page menu.  The food was delightful, my husband enjoyed the Shrimp Bon Bon and Steak Frites especially.  The restaurant got packed quite quickly on a Saturday night, I was glad we had made reservation.  We enjoyed our delicious and relaxing meal, would love to come back to try other dishes soon.
