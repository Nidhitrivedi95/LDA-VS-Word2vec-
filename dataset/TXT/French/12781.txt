4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I was impressed that they had a gluten free menu but there was not one gluten free vegan option so I just asked them to make me quinoa with vegetables.  Somehow what I got was a bowl of broth so I had to try to fish out my meal which now was soaked and had no flavor.  I can't imagine what the chef was thinking when he poured broth over my meal and turned it into soup.
