xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g This is an ultra-swanky - if not necessarily "classy" - upscale restaurant at the heart of the Strip.  I mean, how can a restaurant located on the landing of a fake Eiffel Tower in an amusement park hotel on the Strip in Las Vegas truly ever be considered classy? It couldn't. Anyhow, my dad, stepsister, her friend and I came here for dad's birthday a few weeks ago because he had always wanted to try it. You ride up an elevator to the restaurant and anti-climactically emerge into what amounts to the kitchen.  The layout of the restaurant is in tiers with booths facing out to the windows and a spectacular panoramic view of the Bellagio and its fountains.  The service is quite attentive, however the head waiter was just a tad bit creepy in his mannerisms and tone.  Now, the food is where this restaurant loses two stars because, although obviously quality ingredients, it just wasn't what you'd expect when you're laying out this kind of cash.  Appetizers were fair: Cynthia is right, the carpaccio is excellent, however, being a fan of fast food, it struck me as glorified Arby's meat.  I dunno. The scallop appie only came with two (for 20 bucks). The surf n' turf consisted of a very good fillet, but topped only with a small amount of baked crab meat, not the lobster tail that one would typically expect.  The sauces were just fair.  My stepsister's friend had the whole lobster, the presentation of which was odd: it was upside down and laid open on the plate, with spinach leaves and mushrooms tucked under the meat. Weird. Everything is a la carte, so you lay out more shells for the side dishes.  The potatoes au gratin were quite good, but the sauteed mushrooms a bit flavorless and gummy.  So all in all, have dinner here if its a super special occasion and someone else (such as dad) is footing the bill.
