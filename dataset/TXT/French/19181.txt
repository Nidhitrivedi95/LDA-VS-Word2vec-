aSC-WLyJptVpziJpR98Ykg We were very disappointed.  
The sea bass was brought to the table uncooked. When this was pointed out to the wait person, it was replaced. But it took more than fifteen minutes, by which time, my wife had finished her meal. We were charged in full with no adjustment.
Our server was very good.
