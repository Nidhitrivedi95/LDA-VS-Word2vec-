9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg I came here for a dinner last weekend. I was expecting this place to be really fancy and pretensious and all but it turned out to be a casual hip place with modern ambiance. Walls are dominated by odd paintings a la Andy Warhol, which I liked at first but eventually gave me headaches -_- Menu was so confusing. There were 4 different sections. French, fusion, veggie and another section I don't remember. Foods were cheaper than normal hotel restaurant prices.

I had rabbit porschetta and halibut for main. My friend had lobster salad and then lamb loins. The tastes were average. I did like halibut but it is the same thing you could have tasted at other restaurants. The rabbit appetizer had weird aftertaste. Friend liked her lobster salad and lamb loins although she said lamb loins were tough and bland. 

Total bill was $230 with tips after dinners, desserts and a bottle of wine. Not worth it imo as I thought the foods were generic.
