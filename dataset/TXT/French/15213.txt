63qPRnFAjxtchnSTWBxwbw Such yummy poutine. It's such big portion-- I wish I could have shared it with someone. I think I ate half of it and was done. The drawback was that they charged extra for me to box up the food, but I guess you have to make sacrifices for future promises of yumminess I guess.
