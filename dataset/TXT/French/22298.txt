BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag We won't be back. Sat on outside patio & were then soaked by the musters. When we told the waiter we were getting drenched, we had NO response. 20 minutes later, as we were finishing up, the wait staff comes by to say someone complained  about the misters & they were turning them off. Really?
