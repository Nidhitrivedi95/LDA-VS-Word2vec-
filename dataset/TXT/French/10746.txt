4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Came here for breakfast and I left very happy with my overall experience.

Frankly you can give this place 4 stars simply for its amazing location right on the strip across from the Bellagio fountains.  The view here is great and the fact they keep even the outdoor area cool with huge blasts of AC is an accomplishment in of itself.

The breakfast chow was pretty decent.  I had a simple ham and cheese omelet and it was good.  A nice side of potatoes helped round out the meal.  But the real attraction for me was being able to simply sit right on the Vegas strip and take in the nice street view across from the Bellagio.  Nothing is more relaxing than sipping my morning coffee while soaking in the surroundings.

If you want something classy and somewhat refined as opposed to the usual craziness of the Vegas strip, definitely pay a visit here.  The food isn't cheap but the experience is worth the price.
