I attended a private function before they opened where I sampled all sorts of meats and pate. Amazing. I have come for cocktails. Also amazing. Get the sticky pig - bourbon and some other amazing things - probably some bacon infused goodness in there. They also , oddly enough, have really good fries. I also came for dessert - apple bread pudding and some chocolate mousse thing. OMFreakingGawd. The dessert is incredible! 

The inside is really very nice. DragonFly, who previously occupied this space, could never figure out what they were - was it a club? A restaurant? A bar? Who knows! The space seemed awkward and dark. The owner here has certainly figured out how to make the space work. Very cool. Also worth noting - the bartender Juan is an incredibly cool dude... he creates a really fun environment at the bar entertaining customers with conversation. I'm a fan of this place.
