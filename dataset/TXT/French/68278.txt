vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ I have been to Legume a few times in recent weeks for work, and I have not been disappointed. Not all the dishes are 5-star, and a few wines by the glass are mediocre, but more often than not the food was delicious (their rustic lamb steak was amazing - a very interesting cut), and the service is as it should be (helpful, not overbearing)
