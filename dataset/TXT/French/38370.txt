JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g Went for dinner.  Good drinks, decent service, bland dinner.  My meal consisted of dry chicken in a crepe with a garnish of dry bland roasted potatoes.  My friend's meals were similar.  I definitely expected more based on the other reviews, but in their defense, they were all brunch reviews.  I would not go back for dinner but the smoked trout app was good.
