SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ Simply fantastic.

No other words are necessary but I'll toss some in to meet the guidelines.

This place is remarkable for being where it is here in the state of Ohio.  All of the breakfast food is prepared absolutely perfectly and all of the pastries are the best I've ever had in my life.

If you go here you MUST get a pastry, any one of them is fine.

My wife and I are pumped to go here for one of the dinner experiences.
