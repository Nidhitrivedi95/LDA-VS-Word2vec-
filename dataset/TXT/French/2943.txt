0Xr0kte9ADAfZ-GBO-wimg I ate here solo while on business.  I ordered the steak and frittes along with a few glasses of wine.  The service was fair and the food was not good.  There was a guy out front offering coupons for a free appetizer or dessert...that should have been a clue.  The food was tasteless, the steak was fatty and tough.  Try other places and don't waste your money here.
