C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA We met some friends for a reunion. What a disappointment this place was. The atmosphere is okay buIt a bit noisy. The server was friendly but the food took forever to arrive. The food was pretty disappointing. The menu offers some creative descriptions but the actual food is pretty bland. We had the "scrolls", Pizza Four and one of the pasta dishes. Bland and disappointing. I could never get the attention of the server to get some salt or something to get the dish to taste better. It was pretty tight and squeezed in there so it felt awkward.  We had friends with a child so that may have been why it felt so tight.  I wish we had gone to Sotto Voce instead.
