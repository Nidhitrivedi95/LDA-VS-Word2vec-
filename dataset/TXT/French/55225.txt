rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I love this place! It might be one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. Great food, reasonable prices (for a fancy dinner), and excellent service. 

TIP: It's a little hard to find, as it isn't in restaurant row, the elevator is located off the hotel registration area. 

Again like all other Vegas places, the portions are HUGE. The mussels were some of the best I've had. I love it when mussels have a nice brothy, soupy thing going on. But seriously, three of us tried to chow this thing down and barely got to the bottom.
