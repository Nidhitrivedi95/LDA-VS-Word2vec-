3OCooCzHgsS2xHdN-dNVXg I went for the Summerlious Lunch 2013 and I was completely disappointed with the resturant and service. The Waiter was rude and we waited over an hour before we got our entrees. It's really pathetic that the resturant is only making 4 different dishes(from summerlicious menu), and it still takes so much time?? I ordered the Grill Scallop on rice, the scallop was over cooked, and the rice was undercooked. I expect a French resturant to do better than that??  I will not recommend anyone to go to this resturant. Let's just wait to see if this place will get taken over soon.
