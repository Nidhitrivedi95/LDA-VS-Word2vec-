lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA I dragged my entire shopping entourage with me to this place because I passed by so many times and was always curious about its interiors. So we finally made it in and while I liked the space/decor, it pretty much stopped there. The service is friendly but they appear out ofbplave, slow, confused. The place was practically empty at lunch, but we hardly got any attention. Lunch that was served was just OK. I had the club sandwich and others ordered the burger. The fries that came with our meals were quite greasy and unappealing. So much promise for this  place but I fear without an inventive/creative menu and some strong management discliple, this place may not last long.
