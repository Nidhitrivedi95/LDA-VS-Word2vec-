dDKhRQlw_OVsPLQAGAeNyA Quaint little spot in Old Montreal that I found myself at dining along on business a few months back.  This place had definitely more of an intimate, romantic date kind of feel, so maybe I wasn't able to appreciate the full ambiance of Le Beourlingueur, but I still had a fine dinner!  

I started with the Carrot soup, which I loved, for obvious reasons for those who know me.  I then tried their special for the night, which was a pot of Sauerkraut and different kinds of homemade sausage.  The food definitely had a much more German feel than French, but it made sense after the waiter explained the part of France that their food represented, which has a heavy German influence.  I enjoyed my meal, however I found myself wishing that I would have ordered something more classically "French".  

Beyond the food, the service here was fantastic, very attentive and knowledgeable!
