K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ Razz will fall into the category of restaurants that I tried because of a Groupon ( and hence didnt feel the pinch on the wallet) , had a good time, enjoyed the food, service and ambience ..and yet will not become a regular anytime  soon. I had the lamb chops and my friend had the duck. While the duck was quite good, the lamb was the star. However, the menu is certainly very limited .i dont  remember what i had for dessert which probably tells you how I felt about it ;) Certainly go try it once so you can check ' new place tried' to do for the month.
