xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g This Was one of, if not THE, best dining experiences I've had. 

Our table was at the window facing the Bellagio, which could see the fountains going off 4-5 times during our dinner. It was an amazing view. The service was also well above average. Our waiter was great. 

As for the food, we got a complimentary flan+braised duck appetizer which was interestingly good. I ordered the roasted pear salad and my wide got the creamy lentil soup. Both were very very good. For our main course we got braised short ribs and beef Wellington. Also some potatoes gratin and their asperigus dish. Each of these were AMAZING. The asparigus was so crisp and fresh, and the potatoes were so creamy and good. The beef dishes were cooked perfectly. We also had some really good wine and champagne.  

At the end, we got a complementary shot glass sized chocolate moose and cream dessert. We also ordered an apple strudel and cinnamon ice cream dessert which was really good. 

I have to say, this place was amazing. I'd go back in a heartbeat....though it also might have been one of the most expensive meals i've has too. It was worth it though.
