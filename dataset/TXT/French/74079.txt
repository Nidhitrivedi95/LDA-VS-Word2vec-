To my brothers, first things first work overtime, deal drugs, win the lotto, do what you have to do to get a lot of paper son cause you'll be needing it if you want to impress your date. 2 dinners, one side, dessert and a drink will cost yo ass a bill if not more. No joke! 

The food is great though. Since we took the leap of coming to this boojee ass restaurant I decided to splurge and get myself a $50 steak. What does a $50 steak taste like? Fucking delicious, atleast that's what I keep telling myself for ordering a $50 steak that came with no sides. But really though it was great even though I only have cheaper restaurant steaks to compare it to. The French waiter was cool at first, he was attentive but then he seemed to care more for a couple of girls and ignored our asses for the rest of the night. That is until it was time to pick up the check and get his tip then he was circling our table like a vulture.

All and all, I try to say "fuck it" every once in a while and go all out. Chances are I could get a ticket for making an illegal u-turn or some dumb shit and waste my money on that instead. Now atleast I can say I had a $50 steak and it was de-fucking-licious.

P.S. Dress up if you don't want to get dirty looks from the staff and invest in a soufflé (sue-flay), ladies love soufflés.
