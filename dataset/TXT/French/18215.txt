A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g macaroon here are very nice but small. Only $1.25 each so the portion is smaller but taste very good. Not too sweet.

Cappuccino is strong and creamy too. However the cashier at the inner counter was not nice and she didn't ask if the order was Togo or dine in. When we asked for the to go up she just ignored. The guy at the dessert counter was nice enough to give us a to go cup. Should train all the staff to have a nicer customer services.

This is very far away, about 20 mins drive on local street.
