rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Another Thomas Keller great at the Venetian (which I think is fab-love fake towns).  

Retro Parisian bistro, rich & yummy!  Takes you back in time.  We sure didn't need 4 apps and 4 entrees for 4 people - TOO much food-talk about gorging!  Best lobster bisque in puff pastry and profiteroles. Very friendly & pro service.
