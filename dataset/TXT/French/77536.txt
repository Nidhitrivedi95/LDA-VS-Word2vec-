YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Good but not great and oh how I wanted it to be great. I have a "secret" love for the grey pony-tailed man who owns this place and cannot lie that it was a big reasoning behind my wanting to visit Fleur de Lys (on top of it being in my hotel). My friend ordered the full tasting menu with wine pairings. I, not feeling 100%, decided I didn't need four courses and four glasses of wine (don't judge me). The friend loved the food and was particularly pleased with the pairings prepared by the house sommelier. In particular, he absolutely loved the citrus glazed halibut, the stout braised short ribs and the fleur de lys souffle. I also have to say the first dish, the tuna tartar, was full out awesome but he said the pairing wasn't as well thought out and so fell by the wayside in the ranking. I also had the stout braised short rib and although a bit overly heavy (again, not feeling 100% so that might have something to do with it) it was beautiful. The meat flaked off the bone the way it should and the purees of carrot and parsnip were phenomenal. However, the hands down highlight was obviously the fleur de lys souffle. It was HUGE and so perfectly fluffy without being too eggy and the fleur de lys ice cream that came alongside was divine. I probably will not revisit Fleur de Lys but that's less about the food and more about the abundance of options and the less than stellar overall experience of the place. No doubt this is a wonderful restaurant, I had just hoped for something a bit more...
