4O8fzz9F-XEsQ-gTMgkiyQ Friendly, lively staff combined with a menu that blends traditional and inventive cuisines from the lands where France and Spain meet.  

The quality of the dishes we ordered  ranged from good to exceptional. The scallops served in a Spanish choriso butter cream sauce with slivers of roasted vegetables landed at the upper end of exceptional. I'd go back just for that. 

Bottom line: Good eats, good service, a little loud and a bit more expensive than I'd like makes it 4 stars.
