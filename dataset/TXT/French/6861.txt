4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My GF had Mon Ami Gabi bookmarked; so, during this stop over in LV, we decided to give it a try.  We were looking forward to trying the Beef Wellington, but upon sitting down we soon found out that it is their Sunday special, and since it was Thursday we were SOL on that front.  Ok, no problem.  Surely there is a lot of other good stuff here to eat.  We started looking over the rather brief menu.  We decided to go with a Shrimp Cocktail, the Summer Tomato Salad, and the fish special of the day - Sea Bass.  The Shrimp Cocktail was nothing special and very over-priced: $15 for 5 shrimp on a bed of ice with a very small cocktail sauce container.  The summer tomato salad was even more disappointing: a few slices of tomatoes spread over a plate with a basil leave or two, a few very small pieces of grilled zucchini, and an almost non-existent marinade.  I can make a more impressive looking and tasting tomato salad.  I understand this is a French restaurant, and smaller portions are the nom in Europe.  I have no problem with that provided the quality of the dish makes up for it.  Mon Ami Gabi's did not.  But the real icing on this cake, and the reason for two stars instead of three, was the incredibly lousy service we received from our server, Gabriel.  From the moment we sat down, it was a lot of attitude, and a lot of waiting.  We were planning on trying a desert, but we got tired of waiting for our waiter after we finished eating, and decided to not give Mon Ami Gabi any more of our business.
