xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Really enjoyed the Sunday brunch today! My friend and I got there about 5 minutes before they opened and joined the line of people waiting outside.We were promptly seated with water waiting for us! It certainly was chilly inside with the door being opened for a while, but it wasn't too bad.

Our brunch entrees were delicious! I enjoyed a cup of the maple polenta and chocolate waffle with fruit on the side. My friend liked her crab cakes egg Benedict. We shared the fries, which were crisp and hot! We both of course had a mimosa! Overall, service was great but the food was scrumptious! Will definitely return!
