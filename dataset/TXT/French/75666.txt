yGg7O0ATbMzoxrLvByzp2g Going out for dinner isn't always just about the food, it's also about the experience. My gf and I had a pleasant experience eating here. The food was great and the service was delightful! If you like salads then you really should try the salmon salad. The portion is very satisfying and the salad was just great! Trust me you won't be hungry after eating this salad. My gf had the tuna salad and she claims it was delicious and the tuna was perfectly prepared. For desert we ordered the Lindt chocolate cheese cake and it was good but I've had better which is why I'm giving 1 star less than perfect. The whipped cream was frozen and the cheese cake was missing flavor. All in all a good experience and we'll definitely be going back for that salad.
