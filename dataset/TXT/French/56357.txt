rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I have to admit that I checked out this place because of Anthony Bourdain, but it was totally worth the money.  

I had the mussels which came in a pot which was separated into two parts, one with mussels and a small one without so that you could dip into the amazing white wine sauce without sifting through shells.  The mussels also came with the fries which Anthony Bourdain mentioned which are definitely amazing.  I'm not sure if I'd go with best ever, but they were definitely hot, crispy and delicious.  

My mom had the trout, which came as a whole fish split in half and covered with veggies which were cooked perfectly, soft but not mushy.  There was some sauce over it and the combination of all of it was magically delicious.

My dad had the special of the night, scallops.  The portion was a little bit small, but the quality was fantastic.  The scallops were cooked absolutely perfectly, seared on one side but not rubbery at all.  

The best part of the meal was the appetizer special, some kind of puff pastry with veal something or other on top with foie gras sauce.  This was the best few bites of food I've ever had in Vegas.  Period.  

The appetizer alone would have been enough to give Bouchon 5 stars, but unfortunately, I can't give all 5 because the waiter wasn't that friendly or helpful and they screwed up my reservation and made it an hour earlier even though I had received a confirmation from Opentable for the correct time.  They still seated us right away because it wasn't busy, but I shudder to think of the wait if we had walked in 30 minutes later because the restaurant was packed.

I will be coming back the next time I go to Vegas and hopefully I can give 5 stars, assuming that my reservation goes through and the waiter is a bit friendlier.
