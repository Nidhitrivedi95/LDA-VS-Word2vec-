uTCOEqjuVAXUOzti5TWj2Q I've gone to The Crepe Club once when I was on the hunt for yummy french macarons. This is conveniently located in The Biltmore with lots of shops and restaurants. All the flavors I got were great, though they are pricy (as one would expect in this area). I have not tried the famous crepes but I definitely plan to come back for them. I'll update my review then.
