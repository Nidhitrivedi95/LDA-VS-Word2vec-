XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A I've tried some fabulous restaurants in Montreal, but Lemeac is the one that has motivated me to go online to write a review.  The service from the start and throughout was fantastic.  The ambiance was wonderful with a diverse clientele; it sounded noisy but not so loud that I couldn't hold a conversation across the table.  The food was delicious.  I had the escargot with pesto and pasta for a starter and it was rich, tasty, and satisfying.  My friend loved the squash soup.  My main course I had the steak frites which in my opinion is the most simple and basic dish a French bistro can offer, which on the flip side can also be the most difficult as it can be easily the most disappointing if it doesn't meet expectations.  This one was delicious.  My friend had the most amazing dish in the salmon pot de feu, which I had to sample and was rustic and tongue tantalizingly satisfying.  The salmon went very well in the broth.  The evening was not without issues, but like a good business the staff handled it with aplomb.  Upon checking in they initially couldn't find our reservations, but the hostess dug deeper and seated us.  The original bottle of wine we ordered, a 2009 Piedmont nebbiolo turned out to be cooked with the beginnings of oxidation, but we sent it back no problem and went with a 2012 Oregon pinot noir with no further issue.  The waitress who's name I didn't catch was amazingly attentive.  I love that we were able to sit and linger for a bit to finish our conversation.  When we were ready to leave we asked for the bill, which is as it should be.  I also learned that there is a $25 prix fixe menu that offers almost everything available on the main menu starting at 10:00 pm every night.  Definitely I will drop by again and maybe it will be a late night supper next time.  I recommend others come here too if the goal is a wonderful dining experience with great food.  Don't miss out!
