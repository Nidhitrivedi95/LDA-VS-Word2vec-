ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw As I said previously, I'll return to Union when next I return to Toronto. And I made good on my word. 

My wife and I shared the stewed chickpeas with fresh fiddleheads, the elk sliders (of course) and fresh morels with crusts of bread. And the delicious ribs with frites and house made mayonnaise. 

The chef believes in his menu and it shows in every bite.
