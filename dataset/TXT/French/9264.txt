The most memorable part of the meal to me was the fois gras.  I've never had it before, but I've been told that if not prepared correctly, it can be a very negative experience.  I really enjoyed it and would definitely try it again if it's prepared as well as this.  

The only mark down I give is for the price.  It's definitely not a cheap place to eat, but considering all you get ambiance and food wise, it's defintely worth it!
