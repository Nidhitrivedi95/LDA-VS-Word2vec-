AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw It was a really great meal, but like most places in Vegas, pricey for 4 people for breakfast ($ 112)  2 Ham croquet's, Sour dough French toast with berries, and poached eggs, with coffee.  Delicious, but not necessarily $ 112 delicious.  Make reservations, it is the best way to get in without waiting forever!!  :)  The atmosphere was very nice.  I would go again!
