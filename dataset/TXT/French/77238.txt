YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ Last Saturday night we went there for dinner. There were only 5 or 6 tables taken, but the hostess said that there would be a 15 minute wait. When I looked at all the empty tables, she said that a cook walked out and the kitchen was backed up. There was already a party waiting. 

As we were waiting a customer came out of the dining room and asked to speak to the manager. A woman came out of the kitchen and the customer complained that the food took a long time and wasn't good. She told him that she was the only one cooking and really didn't know how to cook.

Needless to say, we, and the other party left.
