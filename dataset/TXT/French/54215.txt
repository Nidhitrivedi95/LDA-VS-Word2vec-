rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw As Virginia Woolf said, "One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well." At Bardot, you will dine well. We found it to be a very solid and mostly authentic French bistro. We had the steak tartare, the escargot, and foie gras and the fish. All were very good. The escargot critters were not in the shell but stuffed into puffed pastry. First time we had them this way but still good. We loved the Mille Feuille with delicious cream. Well done, Michael Mina.
