We had a French waitress and really did feel like we were in a café in France but the menu definitely had some American choices which was great for us. On my husband had a lox eggs Benedict which he says was incredible. I had eggs and the most delicious fresh toast with homemade jam! It comes with fresh vegetables and fruit Yum! The coffee was to die for! We will definitely go back here again!
