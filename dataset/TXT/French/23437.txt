c8j5MQqlb0RhgS_bpxMDuA Absolutely Terrible service, and this highly effected my review because my friend and i didnt even want to order a real meal. 

 I cant explain how bad it was. we basically stood around confused if we should sit ourselves, then finally a hostess came  by and sat us.Waitress took forever to bring us water, didnt bring plates or utensils, and took almost an hour to bring over a soup, app, and i think a salad. Also, once seated we had to wait about 15 mins to even get menus. i get it, im from NY and im impatient, but it seemed really poorly organized here...everyone was basically sitting around for awhile. the tomatoe soup felt like it wasnt a soup and was actually marinara. Delicous marinara but it wasnt a soup. The froie gras was delicious, but barely came with bread to put it on. Trying to get even a glass of water here was difficult, and what felt more impossible was asking for some bread. It was just so slow, un organized, and our server seemed like she didnt know what she was doing. There were plenty of waitors, some empty tables, so i have no idea why this place has people running around like theyre not sure what theyre doing.
