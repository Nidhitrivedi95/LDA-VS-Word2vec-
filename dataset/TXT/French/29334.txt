We had high hopes because Concession Road is owned by the same people who own the terrific neighbouring Indian restaurant, Pukka, which has quickly become a favourite.  Pukka's window says "Not Your Mother's Indian".  Concession Road is described as "Global French cuisine with modern flair".  We all wanted to see if their take on French Bistro cuisine would be as exciting as their take on Indian.   It's not.  Unfortunately we were all VERY disappointed.   Starters and mains were all disappointments.  Two of us had their sweetbreads as starters.  They were described by the server as being "lightly floured and pan fried" .  Alas they were tough, chewy and tasteless.  Badly overcooked.  The Kohlrabi salad was also tasteless.  I had Steak Tartare as my main.  It was beautifully presented.  But again, it was tasteless.  My friend's steak and frites looked lovely.  Again, tasteless.  And tough.  Fish of the day.  Again tasteless.  The duck breast had flavour.  But it was chewy.  On the positive side, service was attentive and the room is comfortable and inviting. Their prices are reasonable.  But the food is a problem.  There are so many excellent French Bistros to choose from in Toronto.  Alas Concession Road isn't one of them.  Maybe it was an off night.  The restaurant was only half full so it couldn't have been because they were crazy busy.  Whatever the problem, unless they improve the food I can't see Concession Road surviving.
