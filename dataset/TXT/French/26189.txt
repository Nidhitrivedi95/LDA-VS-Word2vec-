We had the foie gras app. This is the cold version not the grilled. You get a nice piece of foie gras a couple of small pieces of toast, frieze salad and white radishes. The radishes were a wonderful touch that I used to clean my palate between bites of foie gras. The foie gras is rich and buttery.

We then had their take on a Cesar Salad. Simply put one of the best Casers ever. They did not drown it in dressing. The dressing had a wonderful anchovies' flavor (not over powering) and it was made with super fresh crispy greens. The shaved carrot and pine nuts added color and crunchiness. I like the pine nuts instead of the typical bread bites. 

Dinner was the spendy $62 steak. Grilled perfectly with sautéed oyster mushrooms on top and the creamed spinach that was came with the dish was not what I expected. Normally, I hate creamed veggies. The cream is usually too powerful and it's a soupy mess. This spinach was awesome. Even the wifey had some and she was very reluctant at first.
