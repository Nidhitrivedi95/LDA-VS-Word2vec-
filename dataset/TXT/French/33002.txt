H9pG0BNhqID2MTj8KnY3jQ Nice, quaint family run place - my wife (who's Japanese) especially loves it here. Toronto has an abundance of Japanese restaurants (probably more than any other ethnic cuisine) - mostly Sushi, Izikaya, Ramen, Teppanyaki or Yakitori places. Coo is nothing like any of them - very original - it's almost like you're in Japan and have someone cooking for you in their home. Authentic, yet, original would be the best way to describe it. Mostly Japanese influence, but each dish has some Western type ingredients or twists.
