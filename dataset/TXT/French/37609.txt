jA3xcba82t8x06H8NzG4VQ Haven't been to the new location yet, however I remember the old location on 25th being amazing. Always loved that they had more game on the menu than your average restaurant (can never pass up rabbit on the menu). 

With that being said, last
time I dined here I had the short ribs and they were phenomenal. It was a really dynamic atmosphere as well as, cozy but came across as formal or informal. I loved their rooftop patio as well.

Can't wait to get over and try this place again at the new location, looking forward to the fact that it's off the beaten path from 25th...especially on a weekend night.
