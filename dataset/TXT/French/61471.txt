SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ Any well-regarded restaurant in the Cleveland area inevitably has someone from a far away city who says "this place is terrible, if only local people knew what food should be like". This is not one of those reviews. 

I come here every time I'm in town, there's an attention to detail in the food that's uncommon and in a place outside the city center like the Falls difficult to find. I always find the staff charming. The owner/chef Michael Bruno is friendly and personable, chatting us up while we waited during the Sunday brunch rush and telling us about the work he put into improving the pastry over the years.

I haven't read all the reviews here, I imagine not every review is perfect, but this establishment is focused on a great product with great service and I wish there were more places like it.
