xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g This place was great change of scenery and food that you should expect  from a Vegas high end restaurant. With so many steak house options in Vegas, why not opt for delicious French food with a great view.

Pros:

Service: my waitress was very professional and had a great attitude. She kept checking up on my table to make sure I had everything I needed and that I was satisfied with my food. 

Food: starting from the foie gras to the desserts, all the items were decadent. 

Plating: the presentation was beautiful and lived up the standards

View: even though I made reservations ahead of time, I was disappointed that I did not get the window seats as I requested in advance. I wasn't too disappointed since every seat in the restaurant still gives you a beautiful view of the Bellagio Hotel and the Bellagio fountains especially if you're dining at night.
