nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ My husband and I went here for Valentine's Day.  They called to confirm our reservation, which would have been fine if the guy on the phone was intelligble.  The service was really great.  I enjoyed the pork belly and my husbands duck was good.  I didn't care much for my scallops or the risotto.  I would go back to try other meals on their menu.
