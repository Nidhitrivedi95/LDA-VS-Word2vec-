Although this brunch costed as much as a good dinner for 2 ($55 per person before tax and tip), I'd recommend it for a special occasion or a treat as it is worth trying. You could order omelettes and crepes with the forms at your table and freshly squeezed juices, coffee and tea are included with the price! Make sure you make reservations online as I noticed they turned down many walk-ins.
