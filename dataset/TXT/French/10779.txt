4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw One of my favorite places to dine when I'm in las vegas and las vegas is like a second home to me since I'm here so often...

The food is excellent but its the charm of the outdoor seating area with the awesome view of the bellagio water show at night that makes it so special...

Defintiely worth a try...bon apetit!
