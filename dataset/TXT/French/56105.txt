rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This is a review for a breakfast from March 2013. While the food (with the exception of the burnt beignets) was excellent, the service was horrible. Don't know (or care) if my waitress was having a bad day, but she was nasty! She was argumentative, wouldn't refill my coffee (although I was able to ask other servers to do so), and wouldn't clear empty plates from the table. Incredibly disappointing for a Thomas Keller restaurant. Won't be back.
