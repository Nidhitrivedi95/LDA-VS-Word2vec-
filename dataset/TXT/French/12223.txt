4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Solid restaurant.  I came here while on a girls' getaway.  I had the Steak au Poivre, which was excellent.  My friend's filet mignon with merlot butter looked really good too.  The absolute tastiest was the potatoes au gratin. It was expensive, but we ate at this restaurant knowing we'd be dropping some bills.  All in all, a great experience.  However, with so many great places to eat in Vegas, I might not be back for a little while.  I gotta spread the love, ya know?
