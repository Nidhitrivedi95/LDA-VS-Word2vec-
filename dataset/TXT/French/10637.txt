4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Holey Moley!  Went back a year later.  Thank Mandy for great service (a fifteen year veteran - doesn't look it).  Can't believe I had the same meal again - just felt it - even to the wine and it was wonderful!  Okay - I had a martini this time as well.  I'm afraid to try the one in Reston because I loved my two experiences in Vegas so much.
