UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw I was looking forward to trying this restaurant and was really hoping it would be great.  As it is still pretty new I will probably give it another chance in a month or two.  Went for lunch on Saturday but they only offered the brunch menu which is pretty limited in choices.  The portions were quite small for the price.  Some dishes were pretty good and some were very bland and boring.  The oysters were very good.  The tuna tartare and croque madame were just okay.  French onion soup was good but small for the price.

The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated.  Our server was very friendly but was constantly coming by wanting to take our plates away when we were nowhere near finished.  Surprising because the restaurant was 75% empty.  Hopefully in time they will improve and we will give it another try at dinner time.
