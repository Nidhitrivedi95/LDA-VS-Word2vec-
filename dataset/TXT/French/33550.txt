hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA My daughter had an early school release today, so we decided to check out this cafe I had been wanting to try for some time. It's a small cafe located right off of the 215 on the gateway. It was lunch hour so it was pretty busy. While we were looking at the menu up at the front, Oliver the owner, greeted us warmly and asked if we had been there before. We said we were newcomers, so he introduced himself and explained the menu. It's a small cafe, but they have so many options to choose from. We got the Curry Chicken sandwich with a Chai Latte, an Egg & turkey Baguette with a White chocolate Latte, and an order of lentil soup. At first we thought the portions looked rather small, but don't let that fool you...it is really filling, very tasty, and reasonably priced. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the soup and the small salads that came with the sandwiches. They were a little on the plain side. 

I would definitely come back and try the quiches and the croissants, as that's what I believe they're known for. I can't wait until it starts to warm up outside because they have a spacious patio area outside too. As an added bonus, the owner really enjoys his business. He is proud of it and it shows. Thanks Oliver! Good stuff!
