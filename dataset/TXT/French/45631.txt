Not enough foie for you? Get "le burger" as an appetizer. Probably the most decadent burger I've ever had. The fries that came with it were flawless. The beef ribeye with roasted shallots was savory and soft although there are definitely better options on the vegas strip for steak. Not the best meal I have had, but a special experience nonetheless. Being that this is French dining, portions are expectedly small so order extra. Sit at the chef bar to watch the chefs prepare your food!
