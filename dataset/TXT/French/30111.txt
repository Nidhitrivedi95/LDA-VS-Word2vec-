fRu_POqPowUo6nHSRMjOPw I went there with my gf for a week day after work dinner*

Its not easy to find however it may be a good comfortable reason why its not jam packed* 

We tried their curry soup which we both couldn't finish a shared portion because the taste was too strong and spicy* my gf had a pasta which was average and i had the seared scallop that did not wow me*
