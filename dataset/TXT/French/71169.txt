xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w I have somewhat mixed feelings writing this review. On one hand, this restaurant definitely deserves the attention. On the other hand, it will mean I have wait even longer to get seated.

The place is tiny, so either get there very early or at odd hours. They also don't take reservations, so getting seated seems to be rather hit or miss. The entrees here are quite good, and reasonably priced. I would score them as a solid B+/A-. However, the real reason this place is a gem is, as everyone else has said, the mussels.

$17 gets you a heaping bowl of plump, tender mussels cooked in a rich astoundingly flavorful red curry, with a side of frites. Simply amazing... and I don't even LIKE mussels. They're actually among my least favorite seafoods, and I cleaned the plate in under 20 minutes.

Just go and get the mussels. Simple as that.

P.S. They have a pretty comprehensive beer list, and the wine list is very reasonably priced as well.
