-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA Absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale, their gnocchi & chicken meatballs, lobster gnocchi, baked robiola cheese, Cold creekstone steak tartare and smoked burrata are some of the best starters of any place I know. My favorite dish is probably the Atlantic Halibut, but the Creekstone Filet is always a hit, as is the Lamb Bolognese. Too much flavor!
