QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg We had a delicious meal here on our last night in Montreal.  As a family of 6 we tried the French onion soup and charcuterie board as ten starters and several different main courses - tuna Niçoise, filet steak, risotto with duck and lamb chops.  The children had pasta and the meatballs were really big.  Desserts were tarts tartin and crewmen brûlée both great.  Our waitress was wonderful.  Always present but not too much, gave great advice on the menu.  There was enough jazz and blues music without being too much.  Overall it was a great night and I highly recommend booking here.  The female manager came by at the end of the night to check on our experience which was much appreciated.
