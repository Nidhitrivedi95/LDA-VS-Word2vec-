4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw One of my favs in Las Vegas.  Divinely french with delicious food and if you are lucky enough to snag a patio table you get the added bonus of great people watching.  

The escargot are very nice and garlicky and the steak is always cooked to perfection.  We had a vegetarian with us one visit and they were so amazing and accommodating, it was unbelievable considering how busy this restaurant always is.  Never had a bad meal or experience here.

Do yourself a favor and reserve a table - a walk up may be over an hour wait at certain times.
