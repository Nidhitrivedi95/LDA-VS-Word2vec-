Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ It's only right that I finally give Tableau a review. Having spent several holidays in Vegas with my girl and her mum, Tableau was always included as one of the restaurants we would have on the must do list while there. After many breakfasts and a couple of lunches, I have concluded that this establishment deserves the five stars I have rated it. Not once have we ever been disappointed. While playing at Wynn, it was always my job to find somewhere to get the girls a great meal. And with the help of Yelp, we were led here to be treated to exquisite service and truly awesome dining. From the fabulous breakfasts, to the creative weekend brunches, every meal left us wanting more. Our last time here had us enjoying the brunch. Girl had a great French toast with fresh fruit and succulent sausage.  The French toast were thick slices of custardy delight, golden brown and topped with fresh seasonal mixed fruit, house made juicy sausage made the dish savory and delish. I enjoyed an eggs Benedict special made with beef tenderloin and blue crab. Omg, mouth watering and presented with perfection. It was to much to behold until I took my first bite. Juicy and cooked perfectly, over poached eggs, and a decadent hollandaise sauce. Again awesome. We enjoyed a couple of the mixed drink specials suggested to us and again were wowed. They completed our meals greatly to our delight. After lunch we sat with hot delicious cups of coffee to settle us before we returned to game. I can't say more to conclude this review except to suggest you try Tableau if your in Vegas and at the fabulous Wynn. Their menu will leave you lost for choice. Bon appetite .
