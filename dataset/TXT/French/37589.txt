jA3xcba82t8x06H8NzG4VQ Stopped here early on a Thursday night.  The place was quiet. Service was excellent. All the food was fabulous. The appetizer with chicken livers was amazingly good. The muscles came with a fabulous bread for dipping in the sauce. One in our party had swordfish for his entrée and said it was the best he'd ever had.  Another companion have the burger which was excellent. It is a beef burger, not pork. The french fries with the burger were sampled by all and were excellent. I had the mushroom ravioli which was wonderful. We all consumed every bite of our meals. The food descriptions seem adventurous to conservatives, but trust them, the food is wonderful.
