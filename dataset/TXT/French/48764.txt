oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw Visiting from LA, only had one day to spend in LV and this was our favorite bar on the strip. Perfect atmosphere. We're in the music business and the piano player, Larry, was superb. He could play ALL our requests. I'm totally flying him out for my bday party next year. We will be back!
