FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Holder is a wonderful place with simply delicious food and great service. The space is a bit loud, but not unbearably so. The decor is a nice blend of old world style and sharp modern lines.

In giving the place five stars, I must admit that I had recently eaten meals featuring duck hearts, sea snails, and bone marrow, so I was ready for a hearty, more classic bistro meal.

First, I ordered the Country Seasonal Vegetable soup (around 8$). It was the best vegetable soup I have ever eaten at a restaurant- perfectly balanced flavour that was not too salty, spicy, or bland.

For my main course I had the steak and frites (around 21$). The steak was perfectly cooked and flavourful. The frites were blessedly not overcooked or oversalted.

Dessert featured several options. I chose a butterscotch dessert (around 9$) that had ice cream and an individually cooked cream filled butterscotch cake. It was pure deliciousness.

The service here was great. Food came in a timely manner, and my group never waited for water refills or plates to be cleared. 

I would return to eat at Holder's tomorrow. It is great particularly for those looking for a straightforward French bistro meal.
