qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw I didn't know this restaurant earned michelin star after I was about to review it.  We had a table right next to the water (basically having a high roller friend who gets her VIP access makes your experience better).

The service was decent but I wouldn't give it excellent.

We had seafood platter, which was good.  The steak that I had was OK, nothing remarkable.  I just feel everything is pretty average here.  For a Michelin star restaurant, they should've done better.

Steak...pretty average. I find better steaks in my neighborhood joint.
 
Other than the view...I dont' know what keeping me from coming back.
