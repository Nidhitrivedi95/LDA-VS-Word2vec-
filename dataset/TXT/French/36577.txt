i5vxtyiHKYnRcJ0p9N7mLw Always looking for a yummy lunch, saw the stellar reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try. 

When I got to the parking lot, I remembered seeing the sign before, but nothing about the sign or curbside appearance made me go inside back then. (Thank goodness for Yelp!)

Was immediately impressed by the welcoming staff, the giant list of menu items (for a small-ish deli) and the beautiful array of meats, cheeses and other delectables in the cooler-display!

The fantastic reviews -- TRUE!! 

Hubby had the special... a nice big sandwich with fresh-shaved pork and all the fixings and I enjoyed the smoked turkey & Asiago cheese sandwich. 

I know it's a good deli when I even enjoyed the pickle that came with my sandwich! (NOT a pickle lover, but at a true deli like this, they taste fresh and delicious! 

Had to share a tiramissu to give Carlo & Emilie's the final test, and even THAT tasted like someone's Grandmother made it! 

This is our new stop for a delicious sandwich and delightful owners that sincerely wish for you to enjoy your meal! 

We've already picked our next menu items to try - hubby's got his eye on the meatball sandwich and I'm thinking that the marinated shrimp salad will be delish on an upcoming warm day! 

Carlo mentioned tomorrow's special... short ribs!! Is it too soon to go back?
