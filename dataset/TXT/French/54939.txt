rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My favorite breakfast/brunch place in Las Vegas. Creative dishes using fresh ingredients. The drinks are not pricey but if you try any of the champagne cocktails and you won't be disappointed. They do not take reservations so be prepared to wait on the weekend (it's well worth it) .
