D87tFO-R6U8f4-e0r4Zq_g I am so pleased to say the new management are incredible, the first time I came here for dessert the old owner was incredibly rude and pompous. The new owners are so kind and helpful. 

I was pleased to see some new additions to the menu. My boyfriend and I opted to split the St Germaine for a light lunch. It was delicious! The portion was huge and perfect to share. I will definitely be returning soon to try out one of the new dessert crepes! My new favourite spot in Yorkville!
