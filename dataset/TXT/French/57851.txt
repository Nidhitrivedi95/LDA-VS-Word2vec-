rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My last day in Vegas before catching a flight out of town I came to Bouchon for a decent meal before getting shafted by the airport.  I ordered the Jardiniere breakfast that came with two eggs any style, brioche, fruit salad, spinach, potatoes, a choice of pastry and a glass of OJ.  The scrambled eggs I ordered were perfectly cooked, still had that creamy custard texture that perfect scrambled eggs should be and they were well seasoned.  The spinach in my opinion was a bit over salted and the potatoes were fine.  The chocolate croissant was awesome, unlike so many places they actually had more than a meager line of chocolate, it was nice and flakey to boot.  

The service here was awesome, we told the waiter we were in a hurry to get going and the kitchen was able to quickly knock out our meals.  We were able to get in and out of the restaurant in about half an hour, so a huge thumbs up to both the front of the house and back of the house.  Wish I could have come here for dinner, but I guess that'll have to wait till the next SHOT show.
