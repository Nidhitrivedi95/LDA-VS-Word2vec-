aervNtqzrKf0CGrFo4xfKw This is a hidden gem.  How wonderful to stay on the patio on a breezy day and just enjoy delicious brunch specials with wicked cocktails.  My bestie and I had brunch cocktails: Mimosa and Bacon Caesar.  They were both textbook delicious and refreshing.  The Caesar was a meal on its own with a double smoked bacon and cheese in it.  

I enjoyed my prime rib Benedict on a croissant.  So decadent and meaty, an easy cure for my hangover!  My dearest had the Poutine Matin, which had the same flourishes as in Quebec, sausages and bacon!  It is a true and tasty classic.

But the piece de resistance was the warm pudding dessert with maple cream and homemade vanilla ice cream.  This is the bomb diggity and our awesome server, Kara, did not even give me a choice.  She told me that this was the only dessert to have.  Thank you Kara!

Great service, food and ambiance.  It is worth the trip to East end!
