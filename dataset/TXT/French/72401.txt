XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q I honestly have no words to describe the amazing creations we tasted ...  my husband and I splurged on the 16 course meal to celebrate our 1 year anniversary.  

I will just keep it simple.... as we said to Chef Robuchon himself, "The best meal we have ever had!"  (and the most attentive service too!)

Will definitely come back.... maybe 5 year anniversary?  :)
