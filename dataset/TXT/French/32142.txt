gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Exceptional view and exceptional food!!!  However service was less than mediocre. We were greated by a server who offered us a drinks' menu and never came back. Next thing we know he is helping other customers ( I guess those customers were more important).Another server showed up a while later asking what we were going to have for dinner, and he mentioned if we wanted souffle for dessert we have to order at the time we order dinner. We said yes we want to try the souffle. When our dinner was served we asked the server to take our picture, he said "I am serving food when I am done I will take it, guess what "he never came back." To top their mediocre service they forgot about our souffle. The manager told us there was an accident with souffles when everyone else was enjoying theirs.
  I don't know if any other reviewer had this experience but I and my husband noticed that this place is playing favorites in a very obvious way. It was our first wedding anniversary, I and my husband wanted everything perfect. However, even if you are willing to pay for such high priced restaurant to have the best experience, it can be ruined very easily by unprofessional service.
