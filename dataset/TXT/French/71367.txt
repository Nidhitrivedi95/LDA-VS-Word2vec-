xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w The other reviews for this place speak for themselves but I couldn't resist adding my own 2 cents, because I loved it here!

The frites are authentic and amazing. I know, i know... they're just french fries, right? Well anyone that has had frites in Brugge knows these are as close as you'll get to that superior deliciousness in the States. 

The beer list is solid and had a lot of Belgian favorites. I looked longingly at the cheeseboard option, but with no one willing to share it with me... I had to pass. Sadly, the table next to ours had it delivered and I was quite jealous... it looked amazing. As for our meals, everyone was happy but we did notice a few things missing (eggs from the salad, a topping on a sandwich, etc). We wrote it off to the influx of people who cramed into the small space 20 minutes after we took our seat. 

One thing the menu is severely lacking... a truly belgian dessert. Sugar crusted waffles? Chocolate fudge with gran marnier? A plate of pralines? Something other than a mouse cake, please!!!!

Next trip to Pittsburgh I want to return for just the cheese and beer... mark my words.
