rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This was a fabulous meal with very good service.  James was our waiter and he really loves his work, talking about food and helping people love their meals.

I was a bit shocked that Vegas prices were so high. I assumed that since it was relatively cheap to get a room there and it was outside of the Bay Area that it would be less than the Bay Area. I thought wrong.

I had the best gnocchi of my life here. My husband got pork loin, which was amazing, too.  It isn't really healthy food. It was all very full of fat, but it was decadent and wonderful.  The serving sizes were huge, which is another thing that is surprising for a California-French style restaurant. We saw many plates go by that were piled high with French Fries. They did a good job of catering to a typical American appetite while maintaining the integrity and creativity of the food. Definitely thumbs up.
