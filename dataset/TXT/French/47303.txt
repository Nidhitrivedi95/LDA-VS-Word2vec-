O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q We haven't often done the high end Steakhouse in Vegas, in part because we have so many great steak places at home. But an accident of timing and cuisine led us to eat at Morels, which bills itself as a French steakhouse but which was in actuality a lot more Steakhouse than it was French. 

The environment is spacious and light. The menu is large and diverse, with a great cheese selection as a lot of normal steakhouse fare. Service was attentive and flexible. Great overall environment.

Our food was prepared well, tasted delicious and met our expectations. It was pricey, but not ridiculous. Nothing at the restaurant stood out as amazing, This definitely fits with other great steak places we've been to, but not in our favourites.

Recommended.
