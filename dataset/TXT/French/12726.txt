4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I am a Vegas regular and I always make sure to include a stop at Mon Ami's every trip. My favorite is for their brunch - mmmmm so good! Their frangria (the french take on sangria, I guess) is my personal favorite for morning after aches. I've had the quiche lorraine, their grilled cheese and short rib sandwich, waffles, gabi salad and all have been absolutely delicious. Oh, and don't get me started on the fresh baguette they bring to your table. Man, that stuff is good! 

The service is always wonderfully attentive and they sit you promptly for a Saturday/Sunday brunch. I've also been here for dinner and the steaks are amazing, especially with the sauces they offer. Ooohh and don't forget, whatever you order, make sure to try their pomme frites - some of the best I've ever had!
