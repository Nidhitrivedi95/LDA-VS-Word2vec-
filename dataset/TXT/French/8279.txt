4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This was one of my two favorite meals in my 10 day stay in vegas.  The service was awesome, very attentive, but not imposing.  The food was very good.  Right amount of time.  We sat outside so we were able to watch the bellagio fountains.  We had the french toast and the chicken and brie sandwich.  I really like the french toast.  It wasn't too sweet or too bland.  It wasn't too soft or too hard.  It just melted in my mouth.  Just right.
