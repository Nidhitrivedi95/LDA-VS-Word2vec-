A few weeks ago eleven of us went for a three course meal with several bottles of wine, for about £500 at The Shore.  A few days later five of us came to the grain store and two courses with one bottle of wine was somewhere in the £300 range.  

The restaurant itself is great.  It's a bit funky and has a really great old feel to it.  The staff were lovely, though for the quality of the restaurant I felt they should have been trained to a higher level.  Our waitress became confused about how and when we wanted our wine, and forgot some of our coffee orders at the end of the meal.

The food itself was gorgeous, though admittedly not as hot as I would have liked it.  Serving sizes were small, but every bite was so rich that we were satisfied.   
I think that the desserts were really the highlight of the meal, they were rich and luscious (though the ice cream that mine came with had something inedible in it... I think it may have actually been vanilla pod?).  I was fortunate enough to try everyone's desserts which were all of the same quality (minus the pod).

The coffees were fine, though again for the quality of the restaurant they need to learn how to froth milk correctly... my dad's cappuccino was really just a milky coffee topped with dry foam.  

So... looking back I actually had a pretty "meh" experience here.  If it had been more reasonably priced I would have overlooked the coffee, food temperature and vanilla pod but when you pay that much you expect to not just get fine food, you expect to have a complete fine dining experience.

I wouldn't come back.  Not due to being put off by the inconsistencies but simply because I feel there are other restaurants in Edinburgh which offer food of similar quality (minus service inconsistencies) for a much more reasonable price.
