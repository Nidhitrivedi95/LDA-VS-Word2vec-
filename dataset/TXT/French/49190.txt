OpYcHzNmEcsQ8vvk-ojDPw My sister and I had an excellent dinner here on our recent trip to Montreal.  The owner is a super nice guy--he even went to the trouble to go through the entire menu (which was in French) in English for us, without us having to ask. He and his wife are the servers, and their daughter is the chef. Very charming.

We had a very difficult time choosing what to order because everything sounded so amazing.  After some deliberation, we ended up ordering the beet salad and duck breast to start, and then we shared the lobster with risotto for our entree.  All were fresh, light, flavorful, and beautifully presented. Our favorite of the night (and perhaps the entire trip) was the lobster. I will dream about that dish from now on!  An entire lobster tail and huge claw with roasted vegetables atop a mound of perfectly-cooked risotto.  At the owner's recommendation, we had a bottle of Marselan, which paired very well with our meal and did not break the bank. We also ordered the nougat with biscotti for dessert--a light and fluffy end to our meal.

The ambience of the restaurant is calm, with dim lights and quiet music. It would be perfect for an intimate dinner. We had a glass of sparkling wine inside before moving outside to eat. It was fun to sit on the sidewalk patio and enjoy our food as well as the "living room" summer weather!

I would recommend Chez Chose to anyone who appreciates good quality food and attentive, personalized service. I will definitely stop here on my next trip to Montreal!
