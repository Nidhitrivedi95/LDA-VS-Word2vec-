ehRigNzlkRQlvhzKr7PLCQ I've been going to this restaurant since it was CB Legacy. The owner had past away a few years ago and since then the restaurant workers and friends have worked hard to keep this place alive. They now bring you Kits Kitchen serving some of the CB's finest recipes!

DRINK: Alcohol is always a great option, but I highly recommend the Virgin Sangria to those who don't drink. The drink is fresh crafted and is super delicious. They have a wide variety of basic beverages as well.

FOOD: First look at the menu, many believe that this place doesn't have anything for them to eat. My advice, be adventurous and try their original recipes! I have been here so many times over the years and have not had a single bad dish. I highly recommend the Escargot Belle Epoque! I am not a fan of snails, but I will order it here every time. It has a delicious sauce and it pairs perfectly with their garlic bread. For breakfast, their Quiche is amazing and fresh made, either one is good depending on what you want in it. For lunch and dinner, their entrees are all great. I highly recommend their steak or fish dishes:)

ATMOSPHERE: Love the workers, they are all super friendly. If you get the chance, talk to them about the history of the place. It's actually really interesting! The setting of the place changes everytime I go, but it's nice how everything is set up.

Wish this restaurant the best because I absolutely love it here!
