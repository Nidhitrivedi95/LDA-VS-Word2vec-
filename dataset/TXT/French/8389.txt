4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Love Mon Ami Gabi. The food is unique, ambiance is one of the best on the strip and for a local it's easy to get into (if you park at valet).

My favorite thing on their menu is the skinny pancakes. I usually only go for breakfast or weekend brunch. I've been there maybe 20 times, usually 2 or 3 times a month. A cup of their great coffee, with those great pancakes (I prefer the simple cinnamon) and a couple slices of their flavorful coated bacon is heaven. And you can enjoy the great views and beautifully decorated restaurant. 

I tend to only repeat at restaurants on the strip if they are memorable. Good food and good ambiance is great but memorable food and something you can't find just anywhere is gets you 5 stars in my book.
