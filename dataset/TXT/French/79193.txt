ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw The steak frites was amazing!  My husband had the sticky ribs, and they too were delicious.  Ended it with the banana bread pudding.... YUM!

We went with a group of 5, and my only beef was that the sides are served family-style.  So with 5 different people and 5 different appetites, it was a bit difficult to get your fair share of the sides that you liked best.  Who wants to get confrontational when one of their co-diners takes too much of the best side?  

But the food was delish, and great concept - all fresh and local food from the chef's family farm.  They make whatever they can with what is fresh that week.  And all the meat comes from one animal.  I didn't love being told that before I cut into my steak (I don't like being reminded where my meat comes from).  But a good bit of news to know nonetheless.

About $65 each including drinks.
