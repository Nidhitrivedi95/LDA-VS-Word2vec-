ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig I dropped into Bink's late one morning in between business meetings in Carefree.  Having no idea what to expect but recognizing it as a fairly new restaurant I was more than willing to give them a try.
The greeting was friendly and the service was great the entire time.  I opted to sit outside on the patio, which is beautifully designed for Arizona with multiple large shade sails.  I looked over the menu and was instantly impressed with the options.  This is high cuisine in a comfortable setting.
For lunch I decided to try the Salmon BLT sandwich with a spring greens salad.  I would never have expected Salmon and Bacon to work so beautifully together.  It's obvious to me why the owner  is an award winning chef.  On the servers recommendation I tried their flavored tea.  I don't remember exactly what was in it but it was unique and refreshing.
Bink's is a little on the spendy side for a quick lunch but it's not too expensive to keep me away.  I was very pleased with the food and service here and look forward to returning.
