4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I gave Mon Gabi 5stars bc the escargots are perfect!
They were baked perfectly and the butter garlic parsley was on pint..just like my
Mom used to make.
The cocktails were also delicious.
Our server was Mike..a sweet man who made great recommendations.
We enjoyed our experience
