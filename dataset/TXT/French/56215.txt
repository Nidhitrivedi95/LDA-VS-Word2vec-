rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Thomas Keller is a genius!  And I love that he does breakfast- my favorite meal of the day.  It was tough getting up early enough to make the 10:30 am cut off but it was worth the effort!  Midweek bfast is served until 10:30 on the weekends they serve brunch until 2:30pm.  Going for breakfast is a great way to taste the high level of cooking without the price tag of dinner.  A fan of Bellini's I was excited to see them on the list- and happy to say it was well made just like they do on the coast of Italy.  I would almost consider staying at the Venetian just to eat there as often as possible- except that the Venetian is just such a zoo I can't bare it!  Seriously the gondola singing gets old really fast.
