5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g I give this French bistro three stars only because there has to be room for other French restaurants that need more. There is a better restaurant actually in the Venetian, but if you don't want to go upstairs to eat or you can't get in at the other French, and your dying for some fancy treats, sit in the bar area here and order up some fun appetizers and a glass of wine. The bar is nice and dark, and cozy. 
This isn't my first choice in this hotel, but decent for a small bite.
