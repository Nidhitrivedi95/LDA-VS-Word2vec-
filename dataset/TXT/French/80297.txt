zw4Legbcu018p5WcZ74iWA Patati Patata is along St. Laurent, next to an open park. It features open windows and views of the busy street. A tiny location, what it lacks in counter space it makes up for in quality, flavor, and service.

I came to Montreal with a mission of finding poutine, and this place delivered. My last day in Montreal, I rolled in on a Saturday around 10 a.m. and was able to get a seat right away at the bar. I ordered the hamburger with poutine and salad and a Saint Justin mineral water. The hamburger is cooked well and about the size of a regular McDonald's kid's meal hamburger. A little bigger than a slider, but not much (you add toppings by selecting them from a checklist, but it's all in French). It was really the perfect size, though, as the salad is ample and fresh with onion, cabbage, carrot, greek olive and tomato, and the poutine takes up a third or more of the plate.

And let's talk about the poutine. The fresh french fries are smothered in squeaky white cheese curds and smothered with brown gravy and topped with a single kalamata olive. It's delicious and wholly satisfying, especially after a long night drinking and before a long flight home. The staff were friendly and accommodating and the price was less than I thought it was going to be. A really great place, and I would definitely come here again. Magnifique!
