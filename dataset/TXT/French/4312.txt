2gUbgbdJ7IFSbicBXlSchw Have been coming here since the 80's.  It has not changed much at all since then.  It is classic and I have never been disappointed.  On this occasion we came for lunch and I had a really lovely shrimp risotto and my other half had the croque monsieur which was prepared in a simple and authentic fashion with awesome frites..

A lot of folks feel this place is maybe not what it used to be.  That has not been my experience at all.  However I would say that times have changed and the overall culinary scene in Montreal has elevated such that there are a lot of great choices and L'Express does not stand out the way it once did.  It does, however, remain on our short list of Montreal dining venues.
