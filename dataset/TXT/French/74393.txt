xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g The boyfriend and I made reservations the day of and it was fine. The time they had for us was a bit late, but we had a show to catch, so we did not mind. When we arrived, we were seated immediately and our table faced the Bellagio and its fountain show directly. It was absolutely amazing and beautiful and very romantic. We probably saw the show like 5-10 times during our dinner.   

He order the fillet mignon with potato croquettes and I got their black cod. He loved his fillet mignon and I really like the black cod too, but towards the end, it got a bit too salty for me. The potato croquette were so good; very crispy and tasty.   

For dessert, we ordered their strawberry souffle and it was amazing!!!!! It was sweet, tart, and very light. I absolutely loved it.
