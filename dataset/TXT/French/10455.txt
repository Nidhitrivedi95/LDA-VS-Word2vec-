4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My friend and I made this our first stop when coming to vegas last weekend. We arrived at 11pm, an hour after our reservation but hostess seated us outside right away. We loved the view of the bellagio fountains outside on the patio. 

We ordered light and went with the parsnip curry soup and the escargot. The soup was rich and very delicious, though small portion. The escargot was chewy, but equally as good with lots of garlic and butter. The leftover sauce from the escargot goes awesome with their fresh bread. 

Even if it's cold outside, they still have the heat lamps so you can still be comfortable and enjoy the people watching and fountains at night.
