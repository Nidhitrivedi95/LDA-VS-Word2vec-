rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My wife and I went to Bouchon for brunch with high expectations.  Unfortunately we got a late start and got there about 5 minutes before brunch was over and were told that they were now serving "Express Lunch" and had a menu thrust at us to review .  We were disappointed but our lateness was our own fault, so we figured we'd give lunch a try anyway. We were seated near a window and not far from the server station.  The restaurant was about 1/2 full and 2-3 servers were frequently standing at the server station chatting away.  The problem was that no one ever came by to serve us.  We waited 15-20 minutes and not even a glass of water was poured.

During the 20 minutes we waited, no one else came into the restaurant.  As we walked out the host told us to have a nice day and had no clue that we were the last people he seated.  When I commented to him why we were leaving, he asked if I would like to speak to someone.  Apparently he was not a someone, just a somebody in an over sized jacket. I would have thought that he would have not even asked the question, but instead insist on bringing over a manager.

The good thing about this is that as we walked back through the shops, we stopped at a little bistro that was serving both breakfast and lunch that had excellent service and very good food.  In the end it was a much better experience than I think we would have had at Bouchon, had we ever been served.

Now I'm sure this review comes off as being a bit snooty.  However when you decide to dine at the restaurants in Vegas that are rated among the best, there are certain minimum expectations that you come with. To me customer service and food quality were big ones, and I experienced them every where else but Bouchon.
