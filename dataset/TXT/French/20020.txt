aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I am not a huge macaroon fan but the macaroons here are amazing.  Seriously.. these will make you change your mind.  the cookie is soft and chewy but the outside is still slightly crispy..  I only bought one but I wanted to go back for more... just thinking about it is making me salivate.  These macaroons are so worth the 3 something.      

I also go the TK cookie.. I thought it was a dry and really too sweet for my taste really nothing compared to the macaroon.  

How good is this cookie.. I was staying at the Excalibur and I WALKED all the way to the Venetian to get one... it's THAT good!
