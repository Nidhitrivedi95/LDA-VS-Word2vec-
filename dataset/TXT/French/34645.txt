HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ This was one of the most disappointing dining experiences I have had in some time.  The room, the view, the service -- all very nice.  Even the food itself was nicely prepared but the portions were so meager that I literally left hungry. I ordered the scallops entree and got 3 little scallops with two tablespoons of sauce.  No seasonal vegetables, no starch or interesting accompaniment.  It would have been a delightful appetizer.  My co-worker ordered a fish dish that looked the same; the entree lamb was a 6 oz portion.  For $40 an entree, I expect something else on the plate other than 3 scallops. (the apps were also small but at least they were appetizers...)  I was not expecting a steak place with a pile of meat or red sauce joint that provides a portion for two but I do expect a nicely balanced plate that offers color and texture.  I actually prefer a smaller portion but this was just so disappointing that I didn't even want to order dessert. I have eaten at hundreds of fine restaurants, I think I have appropriate expectations -- I'm not comparing it to a trip to Cheesecake Factory. I had a long day and was looking forward to a nice dinner...this was far from satisfying.
