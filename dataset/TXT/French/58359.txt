rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Fantastic! What a nice place to brunch when in Vegas....the presentation is so pretty, you hesitate to even take a bite.   If you see my pictures, you'll see the croque madame entree.  The egg oozing out of the toast was perfectly cooked and the combinations of ham, fresh bread and the egg really makes this a must try.  I ordered the crab omelette which was the special for the day...that, I hate to admit, was a disappointment. There wasn't much crab meat at all and the only flavor was the sea salt and pepper they sprinkled delicately on top.   Maybe it was meant to be a light meal, but I expected more from it.   But the ambiance, service, and the croque madame made up for my choice of entree...we will come back for sure!
