HOev_2CifUcfIm9xDL_uaw We were visiting from Atlanta and found this hidden treasure a few miles from our resort. I  had a lovely breakfast of Crepes and eggs and my wife the  omelette with croissant.  One of our favorite things to do when traveling is to eat  local...never chain restaurants. This place did not disappoint. Quiet...friendly...and excellent food. You must go.
