4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Took my family to lunch today, I have been here several times and have enjoyed the experience, unfortunately not today.  We arrived about 2:30 and we were escorted to the dining area facing the strip- this is where I usually sit as you can watch the water show at Bellagio from the dining room.  The staff member walked us to a table, there was five of us and then proceeded to take us to another room.  I asked her why we were not seated at the first table and she said she made a mistake. There were several available tables.  I asked for the manager who quickly resolved the issue.  Our server and person filling the water glasses were excellent.  We ordered steamed mussels for an appetizer and they were luke warm. My son ordered steak frites medium rare, and received a well done steak.  For a restaurant that calls itself a steakhouse, they should be embarrassed.  Mon Ami should be a bench mark for French Bistro cuisine but today they failed.  I should be able to give them five stars at anytime but today they are lucky to receive two.
