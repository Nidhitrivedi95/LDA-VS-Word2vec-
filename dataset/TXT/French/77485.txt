YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Foie gras so good, i had it twice!

On our most recent trip to Vegas, my girlfriends and I decided it would be a good idea to have an upscale dining experience in our itinerary. A friend found Fleur (because of her insane love for Hubert Keller and our dire need to have Foie Gras as its banned in Cali now) and made our reservations. 

- Seared foie gras: soo good we ordered it twice
- Steak Tartar: amazingly tender and flavorful
- Oysters: Smooth and fresh.
- Scallops: What? I was obsessed with the cabbage that came on this plate. The cabbage was to die for. (I know, who raves this much about cabbage... but it was just that good!)
- Sangria: Second to Tagine!
- Mac and Cheese: a bit on the heavy side. pass on this one.
- Duck confit: came in eggroll form. a bit on the greasy side. pass on this one too.
- Panna Cotta: yum! but, being filipino... i was more concerned with the calamansi sorbet that came with it. so good!
