vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q Excellent place for gathering. The bar area has the view of the strip, 90%.
Beautiful decor and comfort, as well as dining room area. The service is incredible. Everyone is polite and knowledgeable and known what they are doing and their duties. My wife and me taking 6 course tasting menu with wine paring for her birthday. Perfect match, wine and food for every course, except the main course, sea bass, a little bit over cook.
Anyway it is worth a try.
