rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A It was worth the hype. Came here for dinner last week and the service was great and food delicious.  We ordered the mussels, pork loin special, chicken dish, and the halibut.  Of these theses, the mussels were the best in my opnion with the saffron white wine sauce.  We also ordered the beet salad, wilted spinach salad and a salmon pate-type dish.  The spinach salad was their special that night and it was very good.. mainly due to their sauce. It came with quail egg, some type of citrus zest, nuts... For dessert we had the signature Bouchon cake with the 3 flavors of ice cream/sorbet. 

All in all, the food was clean and had a lot of complex flavors for being so simple.  We had the frites that came with the mussels and they were good although not sure if it was the "best" as anthony bourdain once described it as... 

can't wait to go back for their brunch..
