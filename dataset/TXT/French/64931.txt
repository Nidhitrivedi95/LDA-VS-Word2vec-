TI8BCPSStuOgnqBHyTtG9Q Great location -- walk to all the sites -- with friendly, helpful, and welcoming staff. I was traveling with my 4 kids (ages 7-16), wife, and near-80 year old in-laws (party of 8) and we stayed at the Sheraton for 2 superb nights.  The rooms we stayed in on the Club floor are ultra modern with heavenly beds, beautiful 6 foot long tubs and showers in the washrooms, and the club lounge on the 7th floor is perhaps the best club lounge I've experienced as a Platinum member of Starwood anywhere in the world.  The lounge provides a full breakfast as well as evening appetizers and drinks (beer, wine, mixed drinks), is spacious, and even has staff in the evening to refill your drinks for you -- we were all delighted at the great food, drinks, and service.  The fitness room / spa is exceptional.  Our time at the hotel was made special by the concierge desk, especially Lukasz, who spent nearly 30 minutes with my wife and I helping to map out activities and dinner reservations for our large party.  Every one of his recommendations were spot-on, and he also helped us arrange transportation as needed.
