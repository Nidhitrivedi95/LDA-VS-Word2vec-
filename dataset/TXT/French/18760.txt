AHosGBveeXx9YjsQvdJgeg So Bentley's does hold a special place in my heart, but nevertheless the food and staff are amazing!  My husband and I had our wedding reception there in September, and our guests are STILL raving about how amazing the service and food were.  We had a seated dinner with a choice of filet, chicken, or halibut--all of which were rated "SO GOOD!" by our guests.  The staff was so attentive that wine glasses were never empty.  The only complaint I heard was that the Bentley's martini ran out shortly into cocktail hour.  We should have ordered a larger batch!

You don't need to go to a wedding at Bentley's to enjoy it though.  I've been there several times, and the food and service have always been amazing!  The Bentley's ribeye is very yummy--especially with the jumbo asparagus and bacon cheddar mashed potatoes on the side!  The Chateaubriand, filet, king crab legs...all to die for!  

This is definitely not an every day type of place because of the price (not unreasonable for the quality), but it's a wonderful location for a special date night or nice dinner.  Or if you're considering having a party or wedding reception there, I'd definitely recommend it!
