OL_dFyhAt3CVtbbS-DpgUw Excellent atmosphere in this old charming building. The server was great, she immediately greeted us at the door and sat us by the fireplace. The food was not that great. We ordered the fettuccine Tartufo (beef and truffle sauce) it tasted exactly how it sounds. We also ordered an antipasto plate for two. Cheese and meat you would find at your local grocery store. What really annoyed me was everything on the plate was cold! A nice antipasto plate should be at room temperature and the meat should be sweating just a touch. The dessert was a pecan pie (which had more of a pecan cake filling) and apple strudel that was mushy! It should be flaky! The best part was the vanilla icecream. It's a very cute place but the food was so bleh. I'm sure it's popular for ambiance and clients keep returning for their favourite mushy dishes.
