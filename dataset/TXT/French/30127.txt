FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg My experience here was fantastic from top to bottom. I was thirty minutes late to my reservation because my plane got delayed. They were so kind and accommodating--even stored my suitcase for me while I dined. I was seated right away at a cute window table. Once my water glass was filled the first time, they never let it get empty and brought out breads and butter for me. I started with the warm goat cheese tart. It was the perfect balance of textures and flavors. The pastry was crisp and the goat cheese was creamy and lush and thy were paired with a basil emulsion, olive tapenade, and tomatoes which were a nice bit of acid to break up the richness. Then I had the duck confit which was sinfully delicious. The skin was crisped to absolute, melt in your mouth perfection. Not a single bite was over salted or under seasoned. It was served with a few roasted potatoes and a bed of greens (arugula I think) lightly dressed in something slightly acidic which again balanced the richness perfectly. To top off the meal, I had the butterscotch mi cuit. It was served with butterscotch ice cream and an almond twill. The mi-cuit was perfect with the bit of salt on top to balance the sweetness. The ice cream was delicious, though It may have benefitted from a hint of salt as well. There was a deep  caramel sauce on the plate as well that helped balance the sweetness of the ice cream. Everything was so well balanced and the Service was fantastic!
