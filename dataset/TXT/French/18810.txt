ajjFfYbNbij-msLfX8KgLA So we've been going there off and on hoping for a table, always full and always a long wait.  Finally, the night of the snow storm we went there and scored a table.  Very full despite weather.  This is definitely tucked away in a basement!!  They didn't do a lot of renovations to make it a restaurant.  But it's quaint.  The staff is all over 30.  They seem genuinely interested in the place and the customers.  My teenager was being a typical teenager and refused to eat and try anything.  But then the bread came.... They say he was eating something and kept the bread coming!  The food was really good.  Friendly, good, and great service.  What else can one want for dinner.  Please don't go there though, because when we go, we'll never get a table, cuz the line is too long!!!  (-:
