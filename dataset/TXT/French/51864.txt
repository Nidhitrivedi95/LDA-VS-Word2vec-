This small French eatery is splashed in muted ocean tones; it boasts sea-foam blues and notes of sandy earth.  Lovely chandeliers hang overhead with skirts of crystal beads while relaxed instrumentals serenade the room in a hushed manner, much like the decor.


We had a very nice head waiter and his supporting crew were great too.  The service was attentive and efficient without being uncomfortable.  

The Ipads they use for cocktails and wine are utterly pointless, and seem to be there for the sake of show.  You cannot order from them, so they are nothing more than a gimmicky way to ornament the dining experience.  This contrasts the decor and overall vibe of Andre's, and is more of a distraction than a functional addition to dinner.  

While everything we ordered was delicious, I found only one exceptional dish:  

Braised Veal Cheeks - Done in a very classic manner, these delicate pieces of protein were braised in a rich red wine reduction, and served with polenta. The texture and flavor of the veal were both immaculate, and well balanced with the reduction.   I felt like I was biting into the essence of satin, a calm breeze, an afternoon nap, and meat.  It doesn't get any better than these veal cheeks

The lowest point was the amuse-bouche:

Vicchissoise w/ truffle cream - This little shot glass of disappointment tasted like chicken stock with a cream.  I tried very hard to appreciate the subtlety of this small bite, but just couldn't find anything of substance to embrace.

The cocktails are fantastic and there are tons of creative concoctions to choose from (Foie Gras in your drink anyone?)

While very good, I don't intend on returning to Andre's for anything besides the veal cheeks.  Those alone are worth the visit.
