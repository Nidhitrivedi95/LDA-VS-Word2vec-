SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Yep this place really does deserve five stars, Don't hesitate just go.  Everything from ambience to wait staff to bar staff to quality to service is amazing.  My wife and I were with another couple and one of my buddies recommended the hanger steak and all three of them ordered it and all three of them were very impressed. I personally had the pan fried walleye with Green beans and it truly was off the charts amazing. Our waiter was fantastic as he was very generous with his time and not pushy in anyway shape or form, the rest of the staff and he were quick to fill water glasses, bread and olive oil, and refresh drinks from the bar at the appropriate times.  We had to rush out for a show so we didn't stay for dessert but an item that caught my eye was the cheese platter as I walked by the prep area and saw stacks and stacks of beautiful artesian cheese ready for slicing.  We plan to go back for another visit when we have more time to truly enjoy the full experience as we were a bit rushed to head out to our show downtown.  The prices were amazingly reasonable considering the level of quality service and ingredients, Main dishes were between 18 and $25 and I forgot to mention we had salads to start which were also off the hook amazing and what was nice is they allowed my wife and I to share a salad which made the portion just perfect
