gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Beautiful view + awesome view! Came here during Las Vegas restaurant week and they had a great deal going on. 3 choose for $50...great price! My filet mignon  melted in my mouth with its juiciness. Paired it with a glass of white wine. Ambience was goodalong with the  phenomenal service. Highly recommended!
