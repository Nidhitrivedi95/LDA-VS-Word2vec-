Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA My family and I went to this restaurant to celebrate my 30th birthday. My family all flew in to meet in Vegas from various parts of the States. When we first arrived the view was very nice and I was excited about the ambiance -- HOWEVER that quickly changed with a smug waiter and manager. When we tried to order from the tasting menu (7PM on Saturday night) they told us that they wouldn't be serving it because they were expecting a busy night. We complained telling them we would leave if we did't get the tasting menu so they did make an exception. The service was slow throughout dinner, the prices all said and done were pretty ridiculous and the food was not that impressive for the price. Additionally, they don't honor "China Grill" (Management Company) gift cards here. Overall I would give it an A for Ambiance but an F for the food experience and service. If you read this review - Please take my advice - Maybe go to MIX for a cocktail before dinner and then move onto one of the many great restaurants in Vegas to eat. (Trump Towers has a Great ONE and the price, food, and service is excellent!!)
