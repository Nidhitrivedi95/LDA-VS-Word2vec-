-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA We stopped by House Brasserie for dinner during my sister's bachelorette in Scottsdale. The restaurant decor is absolutely beautiful. The staff is friendly and the service was great. Everything on the menu looked great - we asked our waiter for advice on what to order - and he raved about absolutely everything. We ended up trying: the brussel sprouts, the chicken meatballs and gnocchi, the lamb bolognese, the tomahawk pork chop, the skirt steak, and the filet. The food was delicious - well seasoned and flavored. Would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're in the Scottsdale area!
