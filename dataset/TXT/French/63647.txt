t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA Big disappointment. We went for summerlicious, excited to finally try this place and feel ripped off . 48/ person for bland , salty greasy food  ... Maybe it would be different with regular menu, but everything seemed very mass produced and like it had been sitting for a while . My appy actually came with ingredients that weren't advertised. The tent we were in , well nicely decorated was cramped and really hot . It was an uncomfortable experience . Staff also very aloof and didn't seem like they cared if we were there or not . Won't be back
