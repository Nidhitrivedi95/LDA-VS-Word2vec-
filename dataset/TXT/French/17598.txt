9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ I had a 2016 Winterlcious lunch here ($28 for 3 courses) with my hubby. We had a good experience.
I love the ambiance here, so intimate which makes it a perfect place for a romantic date. 
Complimentary bread was warm, very standard, nothing to rave about. 

1. Appetizer: we both had  Pâté de Campagne (pork pâté). This was quite good and nicely presented. 

2. Main course: we both had Boeuf Bourguignon (braised beef cheeks). This was delicious and flavourful. Portion seems small but its quite rich and filing. We both enjoyed the beef cheeks very much. I would strongly recommend it. 

3. Desserts:
Vacherin aux Grenade: home made ice cream served with meringue and pomegranate pearls. It was good but it didn't wow me. The ice cream was good but the pom pearls were a bit "stale" 
Gâteaux aux Amandes (almond cake), this was better opinion IMO. I would recommend this dessert. 

Service was attentive, typically fine dining. 

Overall, excellent service, very good food; price is typically on the high side which makes Winterlcious am excellent deal. I would recommend it for a special event or a romantic date
