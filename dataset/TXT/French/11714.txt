4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I ate here for breakfast, lunch and dinner throughout my week in Vegas.  Each meal was great.  Sat on patio at night for view of fountains and ate sea bass (so delicious).  For breakfast: had quiche, very creamy and delicious, great fresh squeezed orange juice, above average coffee.  Had crab salad for lunch also very good.  Overall I recommend this restaurant for any meal.  Service was consistently good, food was always above average and the ambiance is nice especially at night on the patio.
