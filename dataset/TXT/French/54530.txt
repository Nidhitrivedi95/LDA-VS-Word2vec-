rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw We came here for dinner over the Fourth of July. It's a beautiful bistro, very elegant, with marble top tables, black furniture with gold highlights. Unfortunately when my boyfriend tried to order a salad with bacon added, they charged him an extra five dollars just to scatter bacon over it.  
It took a long time to just get bread and butter. How long should it take to get bread and butter?? I'm mystified that a sophisticated hotel like the Aria has such spotty service.  
The rest of the food was great but the first experiences with the restaurant simply marred the rest of the meal.
