MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA I came here with a friend for Sunday brunch. I made reservations a week in advance and there was only a 10 am spot left (which was perfect for me).

The first thing I noticed about the restaurant was the atmosphere. It was so bright, sunny and cheerful. I love the blue and white colours they used at the front of the restaurant.

The server told us that grapefruit juice, orange juice, coffee and tea were all included in the brunch price ($54). I didn't really like the grapefruit juice because it wasn't sweet enough. The orange juice tasted really good and I swear it tasted kind of like pineapple juice.

The presentation of the spread was gorgeous. I usually don't take pictures of buffets but it was too pretty not to. I wouldn't say that there was a lot of options. However, everything they have to offer is delicious and right up my alley. In other words, they gave us quality over quantity. 

My only complaint is their dessert. I felt like there weren't that many options and nothing really stood out.

I can't wait to treat myself for brunch here sometime soon!
