I was pleasantly surprised with Celestin's lunch menu. I had chilled tomato and red pepper soup, which was simple and refreshing. Perfect for a hot summer day. For my main, I had Salad Nicoise. The tuna was perfectly done, just seared on the outside and very raw on the inside. Very good quality tuna as well, complimented with citrus dressing, green beans, tomatoes and boiled egg. The whole dish was nicely composed fresh, and very tasty. For desert I had chosen bread pudding with caramel ice cream. The bread pudding was laced with cacao and vanilla infused cream. Delicious finish to a lovely lunch. We will visit again!
