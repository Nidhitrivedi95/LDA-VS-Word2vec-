iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg Woah! That's one serving of ceviche!?! And did you say that it only costs $7!?! No wonder the line up was huge!

The seafood was perfectly seasoned and the fried corn tortillas tasted so fresh. Loved the honeydew agua fresca. I think I need to take some home next time and turn them into freezies! Also tried the octopus taco (pulpo), delicious! And the chorizo and scallop taco (take a pass).

I will definitely be back...with friends...or just order for them and eat it all...
