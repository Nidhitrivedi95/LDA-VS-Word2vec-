CpUfCSFoTNlZRzzz5U9V0w Some of the best Mexican food I've ever had in the Cleveland area. Give you some really nice size portions as well, but the taste was really great.
Service isn't the best in the world however, but if you can put up with that, the food is really worth it, just don't expect much from their wait staff.
