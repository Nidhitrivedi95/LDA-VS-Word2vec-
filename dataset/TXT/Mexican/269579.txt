woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ I think the quality and the presentation of the food is amazing. My Bistec tacos was lacking flavor. I even put extra Valentina on it. I'm no chef and I am an extremely picky eater lol but I think if they cut the meat more thin it could help the shishito, salsa etc come through more. I also had the Thai Coconut Margarita and that was really tasty.
