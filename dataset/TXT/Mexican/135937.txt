iob-hWxzVOsZxC5sh0EdHA I ordered out here on election night and got the nachos. Walking in the takeout section of the restaurant, there were 3 workers, Not working who casually dispersed once they realized we were there to pick up orders. So I guess the back room is the getaway from work spot. The nachos were HUGE for $11. It looked to be something for a catered event, in a large metal pan and everything. I"m not complaining. They served them with all ingredients put on the nachos, which I thought was odd for takeout. They should put each topping in a separate container to avoid things getting mess, with the exception of cheese which has to melt. I forgot to tell them to hold the refried beans, which I don't like. So I ended up having only a few bites. Not their fault. What I did taste wasn't impressive. I liked my chips and salsa better than my nachos. I'd give them a second chance, but be sure to request toppings be put in containers.
