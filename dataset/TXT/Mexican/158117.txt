knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw I try to avoid writing negative reviews, but after trying this place three different times over a two-year period, I must.

The food is bland. The only part with seasoning is the meat, which can vary from under-seasoned to way, way, over-seasoned.  After a few years in business, you'd think they'd figure-out how to get a happy medium.

Lunch - c'mon guys, $15.00 for three (small) tacos, approx. 1/2 cup of beans & 1/2 cup of rice?  I know this isn't one of the typical lots-o-food-for-little-money Mexican restaurants found in the suburbs, but your food has to be much better at this price point.

Service - the most consistent part of all three trips. Slow. Always. Have to flag-down another server to refill your drink, because your server doesn't seem to be around.

In short, I don't know how this place stays in business.  I wish something on the order of Momocho or MiPueblo was downtown instead.
