w761Gs5wswaiKRNq0IpA7w Love the service here.  I've been to a few of the other locations and this one meets and exceeds all customer service needs. Friendly, patient, funny...do I need to continue singing the staffs praises...I think you get the picture. 

They have 3 sizes of burritos; Lil, big and huge!! 
I ordered the shrimp burrito, a big!! Cause I got a BIG appetite. 

As usual it was delicious, they even added some more noodles..oh they have noodles btw. Yumm! Where was I? They added noodles cause I didn't want some of the toppings. Wohoo! Other fat bastard locations would never do that! 

Alright back to enjoying the remainder of my yelpin' long weekend. 

Cheers
