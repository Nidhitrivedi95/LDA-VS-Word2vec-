_HVZ1V8IDa49MWdejx9BbA My Girlfriend and i went here for a quick dinner, as I was taking off from the airport and we wanted to eat.  My review is based more on the food, than the service.  The customer service was good, they were a little quiet, but polite and courteous.  The food, in my opinion, could have been a little better prepared.

My girlfriend had chicken tacos and I had tacos Al Pastor, both were serviced with beans.  A side of chips also came with the orders.  My Girlfriend said her tacos's were good.  My Taco's Al Pastor seemed more of a breaded fry than a Al Pastor marinade.  They were very tough.

The beans were unusually white and creamy.  Not sure if they were instant or maybe to much oil/lard in the mix?

The salsa's weren't bad.

We also ordered two medium Horchata drinks.  Both drinks were very chalky, way to chalky to be refreshing like other establishments I have tasted.

My overall opinion, airport food isn't cheap by any means, therefore the eateries should be working harder to make each order wonderful.  As a side note, by the time my plane got to it's destination both my girlfriend and I had real bad stomach aches...
