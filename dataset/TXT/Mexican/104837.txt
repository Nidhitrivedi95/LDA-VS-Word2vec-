Fho2P7OP80-yChCRxkK7Hw I've never had an experience short of excellent at this Del Taco location.  The night shift drive thru employees are always super friendly and accommodating!  I'm literally always surprised by how good the service is, especially since it's just a fast food restaurant.  I hardly ever write reviews but i just had to for this place.  If I owned a restaurant these would be the employees i would hire.  Thanks again for being so awesome!
