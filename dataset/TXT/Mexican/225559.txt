RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg Damn I really hate hate long lines and was not looking forward to this line this past Saturday.. but dang these tacos and mulas are worth every second in line. Wow .. wish we had one back home. The handmade tortillas and meat and cheeses are delicious. These are truly authentic. Highly recommended ! I don't know of a better taco spot now!
