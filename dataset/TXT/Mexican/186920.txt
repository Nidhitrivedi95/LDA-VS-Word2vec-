O_UC_izJXcAmkm6HlEyGSA A totally enjoyable meal. We started with the gauc and chips. Yum. For my main I had the chorizo burrito with pinto beans. It was delicious and the serving was large enough that I have leftovers for tomorrow's dinner. Our server was attentive and pleasant and our food came out promptly. As we were leaving, four separate employees thanked us for coming. iI would come back!
