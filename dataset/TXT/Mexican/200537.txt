pEH8XwiyGOe1t7GlboAgGw Had Winterlicious lunch here and was impressed. The servers were pleasant and knowledgeable, the food was super tasty. Black bean soup - lots of texture with tortilla strips and some heat from macha oil; chilaquiles with chicken, mashed avocados, corn chips and two fried eggs on top; churros for dessert. 

So good, I'm definitely coming back soon!
