3GfJStOagIxhx1jbqCpt_A Very very rude employee  ... will never ever go to this restaurant again !!
I placed a large order over $50.00 from the Long John Silver's menu, when I got it I was missing an item, when I asked about it, the young man who prepared my order told me I was wrong ...and in a very defensive tone that I did not order two and he had made what I ordered.  I said I wasn't arguing I just want to get my order correct ... he became defensive again & told me I had only ordered one.  I asked for a manager (who told me they were just very very busy) ... I guess that excuses rudeness.  I left very unhappy.
I will be taking my business elsewhere ... the Long John Silver's at 19th Ave & Bell has a better selection & nice professional employees !!!
