I also ordered the seafood chimichanga, which was unique to me. Had bell peppers, onion, crab, and shrimp inside. So delicious. The fried tortilla was perfectly crisp but easy to eat. The food also came out quick .. probably because we were one of three other tables there. This is a great alternative to Ian's pizza post bars, although this is more sit-down than line up for food.
