GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog This looked like and interesting restaurant in the cosmopolitan hotel. We tried this restaurant due to the appearance of a " full crowd". That was a big mistake, we should have looked on the Yelp reviews before eating here. The reviews were pretty spot on the food tasted like they forgot to season any of it. 

The Mongolian beef tasted like a few pieces of beef soaked in watered down soy sauce. The dish had a ton of old lettuce and really should have been called a salad.

The Twenty-vegetables fried rice was simply not good. Like some of the other reviews said it did not taste like fried rice. Adding chicken for the extra $5 was a mistake as it certainly did not make the meal taste better. 

Lastly the handmade tacos looked great being made. We just tried the standard chicken tacos and it tasted like plain chicken with no seasoning. 

The staff was nice here and pretty fast

Might be a good idea to keep walking past this one.
