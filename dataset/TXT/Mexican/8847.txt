_u1Bq7QsgMUXSMex8QHqLQ People at work keep talking about this place saying they have the best burritos in town. Finally had it about a week ago, ordered a Steak Burrito, it was pretty good. Unlike other cheesy burrito place that gives you ground beef, You get chunks and chunks of real steak here. It was good but it wasn't mind-blowing good. 

Decided to give this place another try today. I ordered the Halibut Burrito, OMG.... It blew my mind!! The fish was crunchy and flaky. The ingredients are so fresh and the XXXtra Hot Sauce is awesome! I would definitely come back for more!!
