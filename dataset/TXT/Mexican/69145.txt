bQ2uuNkOxgUQRM7Y7RJDXQ We tried Isabel's Amor when I was visiting family. My family that lives in Chandler had never been but I had Yelped and it looked like a good place to try. SERVICE: Called ahead for a reservation but were told that they were not taking any. We were a party of 9 so we were concerned that we would have to wait to be seated but to our amazement we were seated right away! Our waitress immediately came to our table and took our drink orders. We didn't order alcoholic beverages but they looked delicious. We ordered horchata and tea. They were served in cute mason jars and the busboy kept refilling, very attentive. My cousin noticed our waitress' name was Isabel and he asked her if she was any relation to the name of the place and she said "yes Isabel is my Grandmother and the restaurant uses all of her homemade recipes." That nice to hear. FOOD: had the street corn as an appetizer, took me back to my days of eating elote on a stick, it was heavenly! My only wish was that it was bigger. My entree was a green enchilada, rice and frijoles borrachos also great. Noticed that there is also a choice of black beans, will try those next time. Many of my family members had the chile verde platter so I tasted it. It was so full of flavor and spices. It has spoiled me now, I will compare all chile verde to it, loved it! Another family member had the trio tacos and said the shrimp tacos were amazing. The horchata was a little too sweet for our taste but overall loved every bit of our food. ATMOSPHERE: cute, eclectic style, modern tables but more traditional cushy chairs. Nice green plants throughout. Very clean feel. Patio seating is also available. Chiclet gum came with the check, this was a nice final touch. We were very impressed with this place and hope to return whenever we're back in Chandler.
