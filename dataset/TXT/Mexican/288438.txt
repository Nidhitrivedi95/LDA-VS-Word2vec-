yG9SpxEQVIhk6e1o3jbSKg Surprisingly good Mexican place in Cracker Park (that's right, I SAID IT). Some friends and I went in the afternoon -- it was pretty empty, and the service was quick. We all ordered a bunch of different items and shared. The chimichanga was fine, but the real treats were the fish tacos and, most shockingly, the wings, which were straight-up some of the best I've ever had. Not your normal type of BBQ-slathered wings, but deep-fried with a very complex flavor. I would have ordered more drinks, but it was, like, one in the afternoon, and my mother raised me classy and not to get wasted until at least 4.
