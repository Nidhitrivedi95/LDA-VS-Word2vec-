_HboH55t0MnGVaDxzuogdQ Saw they had some new stuff on their menu and figured I'd give it a shot. The Alaskan Salmon burrito was surprisingly amazing. The salmon was done very well with the sauce. My only knock was the dude taking the order looked about as happy as a Marine waiting in line for yoga class (which I'd assume wouldn't be thrilled). He seemed more interested in joining his family  (I would be lead to believe) sitting over in a booth than actually being cordial. Now, I don't exactly blame him. Who really wants to be with strangers when friends &/or family is around. Who knows. Either way the place was very clean and the food was awesome. My only recommendation is next time crack a bit of a smile, it helps customers feel less of an annoyance. ;)
