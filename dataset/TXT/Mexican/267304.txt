wjf1uZNr6E4LQ0nUNHX5AA Please keep in mind that I made my delivery through UberEats, meaning other factors should be taken into consideration before discrediting how reputable this restaurant is. The delivery was very quick, it only took about 20/25 minutes from when I placed my order. I ordered al pastor nachos and a steak torta with no guacamole, I left a note in all capital letters that clearly specified my boyfriend was allergic to avocados. Instead, I received steak nachos and steak tacos with guacamole. I wouldn't have even complained about the nachos because I'm not very picky, and the steak and food overall was actually very good. HOWEVER, not only was my boyfriend's food a completely different menu item from what we ordered, it included ingredients that I very much emphasized he was allergic too!!! I wouldn't have complained if my boyfriend's order wasn't capable of poisoning him! I contacted UberEats, they refunded my initial ordered and I reordered the torta at a discounted price which was very helpful. The meat and the food was really good and I appreciate their cooperation with the revision of our order, but I'll have to try dining at the restaurant rather than ordering delivery if I ever decide to give them another chance! The quality of the meat and the bright green color of the herbs indicating freshness of definitely redeeming! I recommend checking your order before leaving if you are also ordering delivery or to-go! I give the food two thumbs up, but overlooking specifications regarding an allergy is a very serious and possibly fatal mistake!
