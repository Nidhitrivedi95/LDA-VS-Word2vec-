XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg I absolutely love Mesa Grill! Thank you Bobby Flay!

Full of stunning textures and flavors! Outstanding food! Outstanding service! Outstanding place! A must try!

I have tried quite a few items on the menu, and I have not tasted a bad thing! Must try the goat cheese queso fundido! And DO NOT skip the bread basket- lots of scrumptious goodies to try!
