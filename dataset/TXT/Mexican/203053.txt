pomGBqfbxcqPv14c3XH-ZQ Great place! Order the molcajete. You can't go wrong with it. It's this amazing bowl of cheese with shrimp and spices that just send your taste buds on a trip! Around this amazing sizzling bowl is cactus and thin steak cooked to perfection. The cactus is my favorite. To this day, I've yet to find a Mexican place that makes cactus like the one in this dish. It comes with corn or flour tortillas and rice, beans, guac, and veggies for fajitas. Ive also have the tacos before, the prime rib ones are to die for. The service can be iffy depending on who your waiter is. Margaritas are pretty good and I'm not a margarita person. If you want a strong one, order a Cadillac one.

Update: I came here for a business lunch meeting and I seized on the opportunity to suggest this dish to my colleague. Needless to say, that's his new favorite dish here. I did learn something new! A dollar or two more gets you BACON WRAPPED SHRIMP! How can you ever resist bacon wrapped anything?
