zy6Hzao6lTmuJMZo4BemIg By far the worse rolled tacos ive ever had. The rolled tacos taste like hamster food and fish covered in what's supposed to be guacamole...but the guacamole tastes like gasoline. I feel sick after eating at this location. Save your money and go to taco bell. This place is NO BUENO.
