es3Fq9KNp6Ry994x4T4ZYg This place is sooooo fantastic!  Awesome food and baked goods at very affordable prices!  I like going early in the morning when they first open!  Their empanadas are fresh and fantastic!  A huge machada and potato burrito with cheese is only $3.75.  You would pay $10 for a burrito like that in Scottsdale!  Just one of those many great little places that we're blessed with out here in The Valley of the Sun!
