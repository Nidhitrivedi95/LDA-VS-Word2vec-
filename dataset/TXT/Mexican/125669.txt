HTlsBAd9j1wlWDHxnYczBw So the hubs and I moved here three weeks ago and on our first weekend here we wandered by La Fonda but the wait on a Friday night was just something we weren't in the mood for (45 minutes -1 hour)...we learned quickly this was the norm as it wasn't the first place we tried but the second with the same wait time....

Sooooo, we decided to give it a shot on a random Sunday around 5ish and hopefully find our go to Mexican joint in the neighborhood. 

The chips are fresh and crisp and PERFECT, the salsa was on point as well. I appreciate they brought out a spicy and mild. I found the perfect combo to be 1 part spicy to 3 parts mild .

The queso dip isn't something we will order again. It tasted like straight velveeta but it came with what I think we're fried flour tortillas and those were the best part of the app.

My husband and I both ordered the la Fonda special chimichanga (chicken, cream cheese, jalapeño cheese) don't get me wrong, it was ok, just not something I'll order again. However, the defried beans ... Yes please! Wow wow wow.

All in all I'm not impressed but since it's less than 5 minutes away i know I'll give it another try.
