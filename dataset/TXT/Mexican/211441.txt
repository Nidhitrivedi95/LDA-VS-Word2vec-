qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A DW is my neighborhood go to & a place I'm typically recommending for brunch. Its all around good energy that offers an endless amount of menu options. Service is always perfect, making sure everyone has a full glass of the endless mimosas they offer. 

This was the first time that I ever experienced a dish I wasn't so impressed with. I always contemplate is a BLT suppose to be warm or cold? Ill go with warm especially when I add a fried egg on it. This time, that was not the case. The bread itself they used, brioche was soggy, my fried egg was fully cooked through and definitely did not classify as the over medium egg I ordered. This sandwich does come with shredded lettuce which I don't really care for. I find that majority of it ends up on the plate. 

Maybe it was a one off situation. I won't knock them off my list just yet.
