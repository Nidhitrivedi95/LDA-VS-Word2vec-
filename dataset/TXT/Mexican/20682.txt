2aiaryk7kgUBhXhVu-9vHg I have visit alot of mexican restaurants especially in US in N.Y and SF. im very picky when it comes to food, because i only want to have the best.

Decor: very nice, both interior and exterior
Staff: attentive, but without any smile
Food: now the most important of a mexican concept, everything was ok, nacho plate was very good, Faijtas was also ok. The Guacalole was not good, it was really bad actually.
The marguritas was very good.

Probably one of the better mexican places in Edinburgh.
