_QvGAqMmrUIlxpby2Ul5Dg We have been coming to Tamales for many, many years and we eat here so much (1-3x per week) we feel like family!!  We know all the wait and host staff quite well and they are all AMAZING!!  LOVE their food!  Whatever they marinate the fajitas in makes them so delicious.  The tamales are the most moist I have ever had!  Love the chile Rellenos.  Love their hot, chipotle salsa and pico!  The fruit margaritas are excellent, the best I've ever had!  

Suggestions:  Would love to see table side guacamole and chili con queso dip offered.  Would also love to see some new items added occasionally or maybe a chef's special.  You rarely can hear the music, latin music will add to the atmosphere.  Also, let the wait staff where polo shirts!
