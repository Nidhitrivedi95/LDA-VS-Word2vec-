Chicken and potato wedges were great, as well as the grilled onions. The huge chunks of romaine were undesirable, and the ranch was probably the worst ranch I've ever had. The chipotle ranch was a bit better, but not impressed. I would classify the food as average, and I would eat here again during the happy hour specials that they have, because it's not worth paying full price. The apps were the best part, check out my pictures of the Mexican sweet corn and chorizo dip... Though the chip to dip ratio is wayyyy off. We thought the frozen margaritas could be a bit more "frozen", but they were pretty tasty anyway.
Tips: 
1) There are few places in Pittsburgh that have nailed  authentic Mexican cuisine, but the ones trying for spin-off food aren't quite there either... And this is one of them. 
2)Go to Mad-Mex for flavor, quality, and delicious wannabe Mexican food. After 11 it's half off in Oakland. 
3) If Taco Bell sold margaritas, it would put Steel Cactus out of business. 
4) Try El Burro Comedor in north side if you want the real stuff. 
5) Read Yelp reviews on everything! I don't take my own advice, but I'll learn eventually!
