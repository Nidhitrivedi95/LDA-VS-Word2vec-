zwNC-Ow4eIMan2__bS9-rg We came here after a wedding reception that took place in the same shopping complex and was not impressed at all. The guy who made the tacos was rude and I'm sorry but the price for their tacos are ridiculous. My boyfriend got the Vampiro and the miniature tostadas were burn and not worth the $4. I had a taco de lengua and i had a nasty after taste left in my mouth from it and I've had many of these tacos before and never had a bad after taste from it. Also, another customer came in and one of the guys was rude to her because they were getting ready to close and he didn't want to make her To Go order. Maybe next time, turn off your OPEN sign and lock the door if it's that big of deal. I've worked in food service and I get it, it's annoying but you still need to maintain good customer service regardless. And there's no need to be throwing a fit and slamming pots and pans when you have customers sitting down eating there food!!!!!! Will never eat here again!
