KMxOoHyRKP74PgosuRkkdg One of my favorite places! Once you try the ribeye tacos, though, it may be hard to try anything else. Every dish I've had has been delicious, even the daily soups. The ice cream is served in very generous portions and the pastries are a treat as well. I get full off the tacos but if you have a large appetite (like my boyfriend), you may want to order something with it.
