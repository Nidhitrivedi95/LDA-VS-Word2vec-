NgYQvMLzs2lbvQGX4cMWIg Yo Rita is exciting, with its Kevin Sousa menu and decent prices. The best things, in my experience, have been the simple, fresh flavor combinations. The jicama chopped salad is crave-worthy, as are the avacado tacos. It's best to check the online menu, however, as it will be changing (seasonally, I believe). 

Overall, though, it's pretty much a can't-miss place that everyone should check out.
