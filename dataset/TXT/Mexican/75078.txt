cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A I was introduced to Chino Bandido several years ago at the Chandler location and I remember liking the concept. I was hiking around this area and found this Chino Bandido. You wouldn't come for the decor, atmosphere or even the service, but you come for the inexpensive food. You can make your own combo such as a jade red chicken burrito or quesadilla with your choice of beans and fried rice. This time I ordered jade red chicken with a chili relleno and black beans with jerk chicken fried rice. The portions are generous but the chicken lacked flavor. The chili relleno was spicy, a little too spicy to me. My party enjoyed the food and for 3 entrees, we spent around $30 that fed 4 people. Not bad.
