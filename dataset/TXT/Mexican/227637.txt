S3qs5ZAZgqDvM88jj17hbQ This place wasn't bad. But it wasn't great. Very status quo. The menu is very extensive, they have a good selection of Tex-Mex dishes and drinks. The service was friendly. Other than that there was nothing that really stuck out about this place. If you are looking for average Tex-Mex this place is for you.
