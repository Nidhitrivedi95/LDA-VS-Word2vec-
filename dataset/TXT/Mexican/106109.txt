fK1oj0dk9Bc6KsBk5mMDxg $120 for two ppl. We got:
- one taco each (pork and fish- both only ok 3/5), total of two tacos. 
- halibut ceviche (terrible, the fish was mealy, small tiny itty pieces of fish, there's cucumbers and peppers in the ceviche, and it wasnt flavourful; Wouldn't recommend or order again).
- Guac and chips were smallish portions and the chips were greasy. 
We had like 6 drinks total 

Overrated. 

Service: total hipster complete  w the pretentious hipster attitude even though we were one of the only two tables in the joint at lunch.
