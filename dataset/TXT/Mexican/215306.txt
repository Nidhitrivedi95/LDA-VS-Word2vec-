QYuojrlW94mpEwnp0uUIWA We decided to check out La Parilla The Lab on a Wednesday night. Instantly we were greeted and told about all of the great choices on the menu. Breakfast, wings...etc. We decided on the Guac Burger and the Bulgogi Beef Burger. Both took time to prepare but worth the wait. When they came out I could not believe the portion size! This is a restaurant style BIG burger. I took a bite and instantly felt very secure about my choice. The Guac Burger was moist and flavorful. There was a tv on showing the nightly news. The place felt like a great place to relax and enjoy a meal after work. We left feeling full and happy! I'll have to come back and try the wings and possibly breakfast one day. Only thing I wish they had was fountain drinks.
