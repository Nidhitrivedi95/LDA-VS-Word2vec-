1tq2OxLMv-yxhdKLa2f8QQ Food was okay....I've tasted much better. The lady in front was very Standoffish...tried asking questions and she seemed bothered by them. She kept looking at me and my husband (who is gringo) like we were not welcome.  My husband had the enchilada burro which was just a tortilla with carne asada in a burrito and las palms enchilada sauce pored over it...he said it was ok ...not great. I had the sopes and they were okay but they had too much stuff on top which made it hard to eat.  I spoke to the one worker who spoke english so that he could pass it on to owner and he said "Oh she's always like that" well I believe in treating customers with a smile and with respect.
