We love Mexican food and this place is just amazing.  As Authentic as it gets.

We had the Tamales and Fajitas (beef) just as good as any 5 star restaurant in Toronto.
My wife got 3 Margaritas and I had to stop her.
Staff very friendly.  Chef came out and say HI, classy.

Tres leches cake best cake ever...

We are glad we found this Mexican place. coming back this weekend for sure
