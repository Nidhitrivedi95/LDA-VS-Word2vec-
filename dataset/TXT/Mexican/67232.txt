Food was tasty but I would not recommend.  

Restaurant is clearly popular with the local crowd, and they do not claim to be veg-friendly, so I cannot judge them too harshly.  However, I was disappointed that our server had little menu knowledge and had to inquire with the cooks about meat stock (she was very friendly and did her best, but it was clear that they don't get this question often, just not that sort of clientele).  Was more disappointed that pretty much everything we wanted to order contained pork, including both the red and green sauces.  Guac was ok but not overly flavorful.  

Overall, I've been to other Mex/New Mex restaurants where the servers are quick to warn you about ingredients and are overall more veg-friendly.
