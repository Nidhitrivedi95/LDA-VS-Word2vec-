qWi9dNGo9D9I4F9RANc-6g Stopped into this new restaurant last night for happy hour and I was really impressed. Definitely a more laid back 'bar' vibe than it's sister restaurant Momocho, which I totally didn't mind. I had the $5 sangria and everyone else tried the $5 margarita. The red sangria was good, not overly sweet which I appreciate. We also got the wild boar nachos which was the only happy hour special but just $5. They were the standout here, a huge portion and so much flavor. I would love to come back for dinner but happy hour is so tempting.
