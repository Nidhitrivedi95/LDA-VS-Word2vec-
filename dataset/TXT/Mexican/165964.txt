lOQPeguczAueJnLmDUTfGg I totally forgot to take a pic of my food! UGHH 

I love Lindo Michoacán and this is their sister restaurant. The atmosphere here is so fun they have live music is a very authentic Mexican restaurant. 

The service was a bit slow that day, but I guess it was because of the fact that they had a large party there.

I got a complimentary margarita when I checked in on Yelp! I LOVE LOVE the guacamole at this place its hand made and they prepare it in front of you! Love it! You also get a complimentary soup with every entree ordered a vegetarian enchilada it was amazing!

Price is affordable.
