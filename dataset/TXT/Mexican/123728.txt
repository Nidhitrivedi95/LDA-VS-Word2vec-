hkpP3kY_x_zVpVz8gQ0ErA I had no expectations what so ever for this place but my husband insisted and I am so glad he did. WOW is what I have to say, some of the tastiest tacos and burritos we have ordered in a great while. They have their own twists and uniqueness and the flavors are incredibly satisfying. The only item I would stay away from is their Sweet potato fries, they were kind of chewy and did not coordinate well with the rest of their yummy items.
