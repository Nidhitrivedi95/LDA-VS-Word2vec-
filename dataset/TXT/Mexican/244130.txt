thLX_k20SPJ0KyusGTBIHw Is there any Mexican food in Scottsdale that isn't out of this world? that's what I was asking myself after lunching at Diego Pops, one of numerous impressive eateries I visited while on a work trip. 

(I should preface my review of the food itself with a disclaimer of sorts: This isn't truly authentic Mexican food. In fact, I've found very, very few places north of the border that could qualify as such. Diego Pops definitely appeals to a more touristy demographic and the local college scene.) However, that makes them no less delicious. The braised green chili chicken taco includes an incredibly flavorful mixture of crema, cotija and house slaw. I highly recommend getting it on the crispy tortilla for that perfect combination of taste and texture. The grilled shrimp was equally tasty, served atop corn salsa, red onion, queso oaxaca and salsa verde. 

I could see this place becoming sort of a madhouse at peak hours, but thankfully we ate a late lunch and avoided any real rush. The outdoor patio, with big tables and a slatted overhang to keep you semi-protected from the sun, is a great place to eat and drink. If I could suggest changing anything, it would be to recommend just a plain iced tea to serve. I don't need the fancy stuff.
