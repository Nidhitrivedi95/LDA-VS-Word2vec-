zCmwErM82hdKl4L2UixDJw I used to think this place was decent enough, but with each subsequent visit, I've been increasingly disappointed! I love the atmosphere/decor and service is always fine. The tacos themselves are what is lacking! The ingredients are always room temperature at best (often cold, cheese not melted at all) and soggy. Initially I blamed myself for my filling choices, maybe I put too much sauce or things that drip, but it seems like no matter what I order, I have this same issue. The taco shell with the guacamole in it (green goddess? Sorry I can't remember the name) was their saving grace but last night when I got it, there was literally a square inch of the shell that was what I ordered- the rest was a regular flour tortilla. It also had barely any meat in it. I'm sure I'll be back for just margaritas and the guacamole (love the ones with goat cheese in them!) but that is it. Normally I wouldn't complain about such inexpensive tacos but everyone hypes it up so much, I had to bring it down a notch!
