NkcT0GT7Xt2mtvIgHSxOcw I really want to give this place a four stars because they are trying really hard to do a good job and do something different in the area, so I say 3.5 stars!

First off, everyone is saying that this Mexican is not as good as Tacos El Asador, but Tacos El Asador is El Salvador cooking, not Mexican and the food here definitely is different.  

The guacamole and chips are amazing and everything is pretty authentic.  You can always get a seat and I am happy this place is here.
