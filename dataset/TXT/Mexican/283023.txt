XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Can't say I was overly impressed.  The service was excellent-- prompt, friendly and knowledgeable but not too pushy or imposing.  The best thing I tried the whole night was the fried squash blossom appetizer-- fresh, tasty and savory with a light batter on the outside and a wonderfully smooth ricotta filling.  The other dishes, however, were too over-seasoned for my palette.  I'm the kind of guy who thinks spices and sauces should compliment the flavor of the meat, not mask it.  I'm fairly sure my pork tenderloin (apparently the "signature" dish) was brined before it was cooked, which was totally unnecessary.   The result was an extremely salty cut of meat that was too soft with little texture.  Any hint of pork flavor that may have been left after the brining was heavily masked by a trio of overpowering sauces and a crust of spices (and possibly more salt?).  Needless to say, I think I would slaughter Bobby Flay in a pork tendrloin throw-down.

Also, don't come here wearing a hat, as they will make you take it off.  Don't you know it is disrespectful to cover your head in the presence of the almighty Flay?! (rolls eyes)
