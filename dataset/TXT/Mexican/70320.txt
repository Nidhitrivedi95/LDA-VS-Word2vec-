BWsCjBVMR289vtojIz-gWw Like others have stated, the service is very bad. One employee that puts lettuce and tomato on the food is always really careless and rushed even when there is not many people in line. He barely gives you any lettuce, and when you ask for more he looks very annoyed and gives you a tiny bit more on ONE of your tacos, then throws it quickly to the side to work on the next. This is a repeated occurrence with the same employee that we have noticed several times. Because he is rushing so fast, the orders get backed up at the salsa and end up getting mixed up, and you get somebody else's toppings on your tacos. I have also had the problem of getting cold/uncooked rice that is crunchy and had to just throw it out. They also have problems with the drink machines - the horchata is never consistent and is usually watery. Sometimes the soda fountain is not maintained so you just get a weird soda water heavy cup of coke. I understand having a bad experience occasionally, but the service and quality has been bad most times I have visited.
