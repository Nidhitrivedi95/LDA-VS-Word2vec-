DUAKXNEh7c2v8mu8nWKYOg This little hole in the wall taqueria is great!! 
The menu was nice and varied. 
I had a carne asada torta with beans no rice. The bread was toasted perfectly! It was loaded up with meat, beans, lettuce, onion, pickled jalapeño, mayo, and guacamole (I left the tomato off). The torta was full of flavor and good bread really makes all the difference and that was good bread. 
The beans were good old plain refried beans with cheese on the top. 
I opted out on the Spanish rice but my husband got it and he said his was just ok. It was his least favorite of his meal (he also got a crane asada torta. It was a little mushy for him. 
I am a bit of a water snob so I chose to get a orange Fanta out of the bottle because I was doubtful the water would taste decent. My husband got some though and he said it was pretty good for city water so I tasted it and wished I would have just got water too (just not a soda drinker).
I would recommend this place for sure and will probably return when I'm on that side of town and want good Mexican food. 
One thing to keep in mind, it is outdoor seating only so during the day it will be hot. There are no fans to circulate the air. 
4 stars only because of the mushy rice - everything else was fantastic!
