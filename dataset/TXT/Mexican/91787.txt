dZh_YnKaX41cPHg1nTOx-g I have been going to this location for 2 years now and it seems as though there are some changes that have been made recently...unfortunately for the worse I feel like. Most of the people who are working here now are robots when they are making your bowl/burrito. If you order a veggie bowl, that doesn't mean give a teaspoon of cheese and a teaspoon of sour cream... It means I don't want the damn meat but the rest of it I want and all I ask is my bowl to be all the way full! Not a half filled bowl when it's all said and done! They have gotten so robotic that if you ask for more of something it's literally another teaspoon of it! If I wanted a teaspoon worth of food I would go to Taco Bell and ask for the 3 beans in my burrito! Not sure what's going on with the change or if maybe the robots are all malfunctioning but I'll be changing the location I go to for my next visit. Even if that means driving out of my way.
