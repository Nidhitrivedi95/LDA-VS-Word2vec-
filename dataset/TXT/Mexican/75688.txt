CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q Probably the best tacos I've ever had. I'd like to explain exactly everything I ate but I can't. My cousin ordered us a huge tray of food and I couldn't stop shoveling tacos and quesadillas in my mouth.  The tacos were a pork and the quesadilla was straight cheese.  Very flavorful.  Place was packed, seating was limited. Sat under the bull and waited for my cousin to come back With the food. She lives in the area and thought I'd like this place...she was right.  Eat here, it's good and worth the wait.
