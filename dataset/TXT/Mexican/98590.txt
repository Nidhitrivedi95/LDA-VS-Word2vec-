EP1do6l8hLyIGEru0gN3EQ I went here with a friend of mine for their $1 Taco Tuesday night. We ordered their margaritas which was uberly divine. I had their mango and my friend had their cucumber one. Both tasted great and as far as the tacos goes, we ordered their beef with tomatoes and guacamole. The meat was moist but it wasn't really tasteful to me so I had to add in some hot sauce. So a better job could be done here. 

As far as the place goes, it's small and it's got a full bar area upfront and a few tables. It's festive with some really bright colors which makes it a wonder for the place to light up. Their roof is like looking at some stars at night. Located by Ohio City, the place was fairly easy to find. The only other thing which is kind of a downer is that the place is pretty cramped so you may be sitting close to others so it may seem claustrophobic for some. As far as their menu, they have tacos but you can also order some pad thai and fried rice. I like how it has a twist of some Asian dishes but not sure if it should go together though. Service was great and we were paid attention for all the appropriate times. 

I'd come again with some group of friends but be careful during the nighttime because the place can get a bit sketchy.
