GOezrHQC2R_ML48EEpKJ5Q I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately my first take out did not leave me with the desire to return. So I won't be. 

I love Mexican food, the food I had here (Two shredded beef tacos) were really bland. The meat was very tough and difficult to chew. I'm almost certain it had been reheated once or twice. The beans tasted burnt. 

I didn't go inside so I can't speak to the atmosphere or cleanliness. I saw a woman mopping so that's good. I also liked their rice. 

I wish it was better, but first time experiences matter.
