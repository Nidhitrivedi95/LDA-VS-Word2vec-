wKA2y-F_fPcBDOkpzDB9eQ I'm always looking for a good mole. I decided to switch the standards enchilada sauce for the home made mole (extra $2.00 charge) but was disappointed. The vegetarian enchiladas were not something to write home about. Normally the sauce, tortilla and the filling (steamed vegetables) come together over all I would not order this dish again. I've had much better vegetarian enchiladas in other restaurant. This plate was not cheap I was disappointed. The beans had a good home made taste but the Spanish rice was not properly cooked hard texture. The staff was really kind in celebrating in singing at my daughters birthday dinner. Thank you.
