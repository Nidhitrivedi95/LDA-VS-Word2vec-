FtLibezRe7HsT13BLpR-Dg I am a very constant Susie's customer I get posole from them almost every Sunday ordered to go. Lately though the customer service has been so bad. I call my order in 15 -20mins ahead of time and when I arrive to pick it up it takes 5 mins to even be acknowledged by someone and then another 20 mins to get my food that I already called in 20 minutes prior. It's just soup it's not hard to ladel soup into a to go container. I think because of these very annoying experiences of bad service they may have lost me as a consistent customer. There food is good but service HORRIBLE!
