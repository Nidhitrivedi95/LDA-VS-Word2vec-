sEvsx89wie9oSU5AlvCBGg Stumbled across this place by accident.
The wave on the sign & large garage door on the front caused me to I initially think that it was a car wash.
Similar to a Qudoba or Chipotle but much more fresh.
They have daily lunch specials that include a drink.
Very impressed!
I will definitely be back!
