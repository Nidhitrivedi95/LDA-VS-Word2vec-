I got the supreme nachos with tofu and black beans for only $6.95. SO MUCH FOOD! And it was very tasty. It had a lot of flavor and toppings. I would definitely order it again!

Also, if you check in on yelp, you get a free basket of chips on your next visit.

They also have a great canned beer selection!
