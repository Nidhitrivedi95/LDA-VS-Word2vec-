rp1TgQObnIIRZw3fHWSwJA I wish I lived closer to Luchita's - well, I guess I live close to A luchita's but not this one. The hudson location is much better than the cleveland one. And, it's probably a good thing I don't live closer, or I'd be about 50 lbs heavier!! I've been to this location multiple times in the past few months and I have to say, it's one of my favorite mex restaurants in NEO. Love their chips and salsa. Their queso is wonderful too!! 

If you're in the mood for margs, I'd definitely recommend getting the margarita flight. You get a sampler of three margaritas of the bartender's choice - and by sampler I mean a glass of each. Get a few amongst your friends and t's a great way to try margs and an even greater way to get tipsy fast.

I love sitting out on the patio in the summer, but inside is just as good in the winter. The waiters/waitresses are all super friendly and on slow days when they have time, fun to talk to. I've never had a trip there with poor service and like I said, I've been about 6 times between July and last week. 

I fell in love with their cheese and potato enchiladas, so basically never steer away from it when I go. It's so different from other mexican restaurants and I was a bit hesitant to try it the first time around, but the waitress highly recommended it and I haven't looked back since! It's basically a pureed blend of potato, spinach, etc (the two things I can actually see) which is mixed with cheese. I got the mole sauce once but didn't like the sweet flavor so have gotten the enchiladas with the red sauce ever since.... LOVE....

I also love the area that Luchita's is in. SUPER cute - First and Main. Parking can suck if it's a weekend or weeknight, but you'll eventually find a spot- Just keep swimming... food is worth it :)
