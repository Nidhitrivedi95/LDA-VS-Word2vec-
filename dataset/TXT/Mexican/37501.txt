5t9kTG9DakuamJgY65HA7w Here with this place you get a 3-for-1 kind of venue which consists of a restaurant and karaoke on one side and a nightclub on the opposite side. The nightclub has a fully stocked bar so have at it. 
If you're in the mood for hookah, well you can get one here for around $25. You're feeling hungry? Go ahead place your order.
Now, the nightclub really gets going around midnight and it's very much happening. I've gone only on nights when the nightclub is open and had a blast. Inside you'll see couples, some cougars on the prowl and your young chica hottie that belongs in a centerfold of a magazine.
No, it's not a fancy club like the megaclubs you'll find on the Strip with all the extra bells and whistles. It's just a cool local latin hangout to kick it for a few hours.

There are two DJs and they take turns back and forth playing different types of Latin music to appease the taste of everyone in the crowd (salsa,merengue,bachata,raggeton) It has a small dance floor with tables surrounding it but you can manage a few moves. The DJs are pretty cool, they keep the party going till around 5am.

The staff from the bartenders, waitresses and bouncers hold their own. Professional and quick, especially the bouncers standing outside, don't expect to wait in line to get in, you get to the entrance, they pad you down and in you go. Best of all, admission is free. Once inside, you can come in and out of the club to have a smoke or catch a breather from all the craziness happening inside. The one thing that has been added is valet parking, it's not needed and totally pointless. It's coming off as a little bit pretentious.

Check out the karaoke if you feel like letting out your inner Pop Star then later hit the dance floor. It's low key but would suggest guys wear a nice suit or a blazer, you never know if "Ms. Right Now" will be in attendance! So check it out.
