Wcw-xq_c89e4AaRsUtkaLw Come here for Brunch! Order the Huevos Rancheros.

I've eaten here for dinner and must say I was not impressed, but the Saturday and Sunday brunch is phenomenal--I rate it best in Madison. The Huevos Rancheros are the best I have ever eaten. (I tend to try huevos rancheros wherever I go and few can compare). Also exceptional--the biscuits and gravy, and the bacon. 

Note this brunch that I highly recommend is not a buffet style brunch, but everything on the menu is delicious.
