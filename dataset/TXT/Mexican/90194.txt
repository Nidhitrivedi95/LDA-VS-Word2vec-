DuQtouEXOfo5K4ukON3qwQ Our new go-to for Mexican in the east valley. The stacked blue enchiladas are so delicious! I always get chicken and my husband loves the chili Colorado (it's too spicy for my taste). The salsa is great but the guacamole is really delicious. We recently went around early lunchtime on a Sunday so we were able to choose from the brunch menu. I had a breakfast burrito with chorizo. Very good! Loved the vegetables its served with & the potatoes were also excellent. We used to frequent another Mexican restaurant in town but since finding La Ristra we haven't been back.
