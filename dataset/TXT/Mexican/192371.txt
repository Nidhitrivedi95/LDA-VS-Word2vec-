Ok9vikKusbG_Ue9pJf6s3Q Super cute taco place in Chinatown! Who would've thought? I really liked their quesadillas which came in individual portions but that just means you get to sample multiple flavours! They had a great selection of tacos and other snack foods. I would skip the appetizers, they're on the small end and just get more variety of mains. I would also get a freshly squeezed coconut water if they're offering that! What a great dining experience! 

The only downside is that because they are located quite close to several office buildings there is a huge lunch rush between 12 - 1 and so you might be uncomfortably squeezed next to two strangers. This could be avoided with more individual tables but otherwise amazing dining experience!
