BdzJQypceJ5Bam2P7egoiw I love sushi...like with a passion and when they came out with poke bowls I was skeptical. I have to say this is darn good! I have been to a couple other places around town, but I keep coming back to Me Poke. I literally get food from them at least twice a week or more. Its healthy, they treat me well, employees are friendly and don't get upset when I can get a little complicated with my order (Sorry ya'll). I always have a good experience and the fish is great along with the all the toppings u can get for free! What I really like is that they have "sushi rice" as an option. Makes me feel like I'm really having sushi. $8.95 for mix 2 bowl or for $1.50 more you can have a 3 mix bowl. I usually get the 3 and then end up with leftovers, but that's just me. You may like it so much you eat it in one sitting!  I definitely recommend coming here and giving them a try if you haven't yet. I have yet to be disappointed and I bet neither will you.
