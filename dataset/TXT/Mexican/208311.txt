qdd1DHfeKHE72_djJxCJdQ Haven't been here since they remodeled and was pleasantly surprised by it when we got there. Although it was as efficient as it could have been in adding seats, they were able to add a few inside and outside, which of course helps reduce wait times. Also the new look has a nice Hispanic rustic chic look (if that even a real thing) that's way better than the old look. 

The food was great all around from price to flavor. Since I'm a sucker for green chile pork, I got their green chile pork stew, which was amazing. It was a little unique vs. traditional green chile pork, but light, fresh and filling.

Our server was probably the best server we've had in 10 years. Super friendly and personable, Johnny on the spot with refills and great with kids. If I remembered her name is totally give her a huge shout out on hear.
