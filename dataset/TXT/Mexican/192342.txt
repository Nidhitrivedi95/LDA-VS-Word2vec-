Ok9vikKusbG_Ue9pJf6s3Q It's a great place for tourist since the restaurant is located in ChinaTown! 
The staff was super friendly, and we were offered free guacamole and chips (which were delicious and so fresh) because the food was taking longer than usually to be prepared. The meat in the tacos was a bit too cooked, hence making the tacos ordinary. I also had the cheese coned but was not impressed since it really didn't taste good...
I'm glad I went once but I would not recommend it.
