VM7Q3xWH5XiwbaIeSyJ-vw I ordered a Burrito Bowl to go.   Usually, they are pretty good.  The person who built it was as light on the rice, beans, and carnitas as possible.  Carnitas are naturally fatty, but some care has to be given to the amount of fat you serve.  My slim order of Carnitas was about 35% fatty material and the rest meat.  Where the first level of bowl building was slim, the second level, sauces, cheese, sc and guac were the exact opposite and my bowl was doused with humongous amounts of sauce, corn, Sour Cream, but skinny on the guac.  I paid at the register and before I could even get my food picked up, the cashier was on their phone texting, someone.  If you guys dont care about the product you put out, and dont care about the customer experience, I can spend my money elsewhere.  I drove 4 miles to get to this store.  I definitely will not make this mistake again.  Note to the Children who work in these restaurants and all restaurants.  The Customer is your boss, your friends who you text constantly could care less about your life at work...I pay your salary, not the corporation, not your bosses, but me the customer.  I vote with my wallet.  I choose to spend elsewhere.  When you treat enough people like this, then they will go away too, and you will be looking for a new job, and it will not pay you 12.00 to look at your phone all day.  When are you children going to get that message??????Thanks Chipoltle, it was a good run.  Time to find another place to eat.
