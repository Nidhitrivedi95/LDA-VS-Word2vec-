P8IsTiHq5Hesa6UPL604ww Some of the best tacos I have ever had! And absolutely amazing quality food for a great price. We tried the carnitas, chicken, and fish tacos and all were outstanding. Also really enjoyed their beans and guacamole. We shared an order of the nachos with steak, and they were fantastic but a little soggy towards the bottom. The food was also served very quickly, so we were in and out of the restaurant in no time. Definitely recommend that you try los taquitos if you are in the Phoenix area!
