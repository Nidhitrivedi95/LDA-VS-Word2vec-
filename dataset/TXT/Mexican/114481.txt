GGecutXeoEVlYKoxVo2WPA Beyond amazing Mexican soups! Usually they run out by mid morning tho so you have to get it while it's hot. The service is on point as well, everyone is so friendly and helpful. I live 45 minutes away but every time I come out to visit my friend or in the area I have to stop here and get a soup. They have good Mexican food in general as well
