l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA Went back to Chino a few weeks ago.  Still good food.  I had the Emerald Chicken, Machaca Quesadilla, and the Jerk Fried Rice.  Emerald Chicken was good at first, but then the ginger just kinda took over.  I still liked it though, just maybe a little less of it.

Machaca Quesadilla is my fav.  Can't go wrong.

Dom loved it all, the way he was eating you would have thought it was his last meal!  

Morgan had the Chile Relleno, she liked the flavor but said the wrapper fell right off when cut it, it looked like filo dough?? strange. She also had the Chicken fried rice, which was better than my Jerk Rice... when will I learn that she is just better at ordering (she discovered my fav machaca)? 

OMG, now I totally have to go there again... I'm starving!

Only one complaint.  The sauces there are weird... they should buy my famous salsa, it would SO GO WITH EVERYTHING HERE!
