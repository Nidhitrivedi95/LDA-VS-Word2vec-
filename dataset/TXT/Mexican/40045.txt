The popsicles are very impressive looking. They have ice cream thats milk and water based so if you're lactose intolerant, this is a great place to check out. Some of their flavors are quite savory and not overly sweet so if you're sick of the typical post ice cream sugar coma, this is a good place to check out. They also have traditional ice cream treats like banana splits that are definitely not for the sugar intolerant.
