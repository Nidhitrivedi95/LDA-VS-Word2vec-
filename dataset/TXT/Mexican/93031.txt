e2ApirIzYID9xIye0r_gKQ I anxiously awaited the opening of this location, anitcipating the awesomeness that is Farmer Boys. Having been to various locations in Vegas and even across statelines, I was primed and ready to grub on what I had envisioned as one of the finest breakfast meals to ever cross my lips. Based on what I had experienced with the burgers, zuccinni, milk shakes and fries, how could it not be, right? 

Unfortunately, they fell short of my expectations for breakfast. It was not bad, but nothing near the quality they produce for lunch. The sausage patties were above average, but everything else (pancakes, eggs, potatoes) was all just middle of the road. The service was still top notch, and all of the employees were on top of their game, even coming to the table to keep the coffee cups full. 

With a bonafide pancake restaurant across the street, I would be hard pressed to come back for breakfast but you can bet your burger I will be back many times over for lunch. The fact that there is a Farmer Boys so close to home now is enough to keep a smile on this burger lovers face.
