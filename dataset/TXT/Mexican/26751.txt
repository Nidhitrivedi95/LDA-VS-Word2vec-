I went for lunch and deal is 3 tacos (choice of corn tortillas, flour tortilla or lettuce wrap) and a side (rice, beans etc) for $10.50. They have a cool spin on their tacos so you aren't going to be getting the standard - they even have duck. 
This is a sit down restaurant setting but I'm sure you can get food to go. You shouldn't though because the ambiance I'm telling you is so cool.  The wait staff were all friendly,  service was excellent, and the food came out really fast. I haven't had good service in a while in this area so I extra appreciated it! 
I sat in the regular dining area but the bar area looked really cool so I'd like to check this out next.
