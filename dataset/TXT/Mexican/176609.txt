MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA After hearing about how fantastic this restaurant is from a friend I ended up going to it with him.

We were seated at the counter pretty quickly even though I had heard that this place his a lineup after a certain time. 

The music was way too loud, it was difficult to hold a conversation unless we were speaking into each other's ears and the interior felt a little crowded, the waitresses bumped into me on several occasions. I mean that'd be understandable if I was a large person but at 5'7 and 120 lbs bumpage is just inexcusable; there should be either fewer tables or more attentive waitresses.

We ordered a scrapple and beef cheek taco each and a half rack of ribs to share. I was surprised at the size of the tacos, they were about 3 inches in diameter. Who knows, maybe Taco Bell advertisements have skewed my perception of tacos.

The scrapple (bits of pork and corn fried together in the shape of a rectangular prism) was pretty good. It was topped off with spicy mustard.

The beef taco didn't really leave an impression on me. It was pretty bland even though it was garnished.

The ribs were actually quite good even though they were far from fall right off the bone tender. They were topped off with peanuts and had some sort of barbeque sauce.

The service was very good, all the employees were smiley and polite and were quick to change the bottle of water between me and my friend when it was depleted.

I'd be more open to rating this restaurant higher if it wasn't so overhyped. Yes the food is good. No it's not worth waiting an hour + in line for.
