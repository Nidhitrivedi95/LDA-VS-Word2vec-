BWsCjBVMR289vtojIz-gWw First time here and it will probably be my last. Customer service sucks and the food isn't that great. I got a smothered steak burrito and the steak is extremely salty. Also not very happy about feeling like we really didn't have a choice in what we got on our items. The guy was basically already dumping it on the food while asking if we wanted it or not. I wanted mine smothered but did I really get a choice of sauce.....? Nope, just got what I had wanted inside my burrito. Wanted cheese on top too but already dumped the jack cheese on top when I would have rather had the mix cheese. But whatever. I thought maybe I could get by the fact that these employees have horrible customer service because I was hoping the food would be amazing. Well it isn't. I am not impressed with it. Besides the steak being salty, not the flavor I would like, there really isn't any other flavor. Maybe it would have been better if I was actually able to choose what sauce I wanted it smothered with.... Probably not. There's better places around for a smothered burrito and their customer service is way better. The only reason I would go back to Cafe Rio is for the horchata! It is delicious!
