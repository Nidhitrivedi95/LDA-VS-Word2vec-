LVkILnI-bXtlCJggb3hfkg Seriously devastated after going here.... High hopes crushed by salty food yet weak flavor food.

Seafood soup was so salty it was inedible, literally only ate the octopus and shrimp. 

Steak fajitas had this odd almost artificial flavor, salty again and just not good. 

Highlight of the meal was tamarind margaritas and chips/salsa. 

Sorry Marisa we won't be back.
