pyeoyouJWxxcwzfugfessQ My favorite thing? The Salsa Tasting. I liked the fresh chips and the spicy salsa. The heat kept building and soon I was sweating under my eyes. :) :) Otherwise, this is no Joyride Taco. The music pretty much sucks. Also, not enough alcohol in my La Hefa (which was not spicy like the menu said).
