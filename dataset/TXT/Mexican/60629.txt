aP2Ma-Wx2lydppntCGhNSg I had heard so many good things about gecko I had to go. Maybe had high expectations but I think the only thing I liked more than other traditional mexican grills is that they had refried beans with chips (some places also do that). Thought that their salsa was average, thought the "sweet salsa" was clever although I didn't personally like it. I always get shrimp fajitas and their shrimp was about the size of baby shrimp on a salad. I like some zing to my food and the salsa wasn't cutting it, they didn't have any hot sauces but had a super nasty taco sauce. Service was fine and everything else, I just didn't see any reason to come back because none of the food was good. My wife loved her burrito so i guess I'll have to try them again in the future and maybe order something else.
