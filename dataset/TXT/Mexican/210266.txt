qME1CvFxSrhqE6-YGcp3Rw This is a really nice bar and restaurant with multiple levels and an outside rooftop patio....

The is a cool place but the food is mediocre...

I tried their fall burrito called "The Bird" which is a thanksgiving dinner in a burrito with turkey, potatoes, corn, gravy, etc., etc., etc.... it was mediocre and disappointing... it also came with guac that had cranberries in it.

I guess if you want to hang here it's cool.
