n6u8lDrWBYkis8EQTwgOyA Went here for Taco Tuesday. $2.50 for a SUPER tiny taco with cilantro, onion, and some meat. The taco was extremely dry. I bought guacamole for a dollar extra per taco, so basically $3.50 a taco, and it was given in those tiny condiment cups. I paid 19 dollars for 5 tacos and guacamole so I was more than surprised when I got my box and it was super light weight... only enough to feed one person, I was anticipating food for 2. Thoroughly disappointed with how expensive and dry the tacos were. Ended up having to supplement my dinner for two.
