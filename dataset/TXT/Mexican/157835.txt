knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw I usually like Zocalo and I was a huge fan when it first opened. It has an awesome atmosphere, great chips and queso, and a pretty good margarita selection. But the last few visits I've had there leave me feeling like management is really starting to let it go. You would think they'd be putting in more effort to compete with the success of Barrio practically right next door to them. 

This is what happened the last couple times I've been in: 
- My friend's Margarita tasted like the cleaning solution they use to wipe down tables. There was a faint yet distinct aftertaste of Clorox. At least they replaced her drink. 
- My boyfriend got food poisoning from the chicken fajitas last night. He was up all night regurgitating his food. 
- While small in comparison to the previous two, my dinner was over-seasoned. 
- Environment: the downstairs is now more of a dingy, break room than a second dining room. On both the main floor and downstairs, some of the booths are in disrepair, the seat cushions are ripped. 

In summary: Barrio is better - it's worth the wait for a table. Zocalo is over-priced and not what it used to be -- it's sort of like playing food poisoning roulette.
