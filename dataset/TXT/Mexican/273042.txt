I'll start with the good. The service is very friendly and fast. Ambiance in the restaurant is very relaxed and homey, with nice decor and pleasant Spanish music playing in the background. Overall it makes you feel welcome and want to stay longer. The chef even came out and greeted every one, that was a nice touch. I tried the margarita bull and it was great, maybe could use a bit more tequila.

Now the bad. We first got our guacamole appetizer and although the home made chips were ok the dip fell short. It was bland and needed more lime and salt. Then the entrees, we first tried the chilles rellenos, which sounded much better on paper. It was literally a few mushy balls of meat and peppers on top of lettuce and a side of rice and salsa. Taste wasn't horrible but the texture resembled baby food, for $17!!!. Then we tried the fajitas which at first glance looked appetizing and came out sizzling as promised, however as we started digging in we started to notice the flaws. The biggest ones were the fact that they covered it all with some tomato sauce, I think that should be an optional side. The second and biggest flaw was the beef itself. It was overcooked to infinity and tasted like it was boiled then blasted in the oven to give the plate the sizzle. I was very disappointed and had better quality fajitas at chain restaurants. To top it all off we found a long black hair in the pouch the tortilla wraps came in but we didn't say anything as we were just over it and didn't see the point. 
Overall the bill came to $70 for two people. I honestly felt robbed and like it was very poor value. Seriously I have no idea how they justify it and look people in the face when they charge that much for what I consider to be cheap eats.
Will I ever return? Doubt it.
