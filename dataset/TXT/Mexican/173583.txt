mibbKeg4gbD9O58TCjDWgQ My normal Roberto's is down on Rainbow and Flamingo which I absolutely love them but this store is also wonderful they always get everything right no matter how weird I changed my order. My regular Roberto's tends to overcook or even burn meat (i know it's word but i like it that way!) as to where this place doesn't, it gets it right. This restaurant is a bit larger more seating and always great service and clean.
