_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g This place used to be great... but its not worth it anymore.
I got a steak burrito, and seriously there must have been like 4 strips of steak in there. They are so stingy with the guacamole. Even the sour cream seems to be watered down...

I hate the way the wrap it as well. All the "fillers" are on the one side of the burrito, and the meat is on the other side. So you're having to bite from one side first, then the other (I know. Im cynical) . 

Finally the price. 2 burritos at almost $17. Not for me.

On top of all my complaints. Terribly gassy and runny the next day. 
Thanks Burrito Boyz!
