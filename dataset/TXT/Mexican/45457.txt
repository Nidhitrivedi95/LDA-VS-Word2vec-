The benny was ok, the taters were seasoned, but there weren't many of them which was odd considering the amount of empty space on the serving plate.  The organic eggs gave the yolk an orange color that gave it a thicker consistency, but it was poached well, oozing over the bacon and toast. The bread however was too toasted, making the bottom much too tough to cut through.   The hollandaise was flavourable with a hint of lemon kick that worked well.   

The Crepe Croque Monsieur was tasty, the mix of cheese and ham worked well with the cream sauce, but I didn't care too much for the presentation of it in a little side dish, which eating it messy because the cream kept dripping everywhere.
