FB2iUwS4-LMLBQVyLZmZfQ This was the worst Mexican we have ever had. There was so much lime in the guacamole it was not edible. The burrito was raw and soggy. The quesadilla had next to no cheese. When we mentioned these things to the manager he started to argue with us. Save yourself and do not waste your time or money on this place!
