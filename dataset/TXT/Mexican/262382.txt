VybpDORV9m61kpuuGAR-mQ Las Brizas is one of the largest, most authentic Mexican restaurants in the lake area. It has been a long time since I have tasted salsa this authentic.
Whether or not it actually comes from a bottle or not, it doesn't taste like it does, which makes all the difference.

A little over a year ago, Las Brizas moved further up Statesville Rd., closer to Catawba Avenue, into a bigger building.

Although I haven't seen the parking lot packed, everyone I talk to has enjoyed the food. I've been told the margaritas are stout, and I have always enjoyed their quesadillas (I know, not the most adventurous Mexican dish, but whatever).  

Las Brizas is a great place to go with a group, if you're looking for good food that won't bleed your wallet dry, and cold beer/margaritas.
