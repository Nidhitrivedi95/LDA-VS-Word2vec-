frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A I was so excited to go here after seeing an episode of Check Please! Arizona but my high hopes were quickly dashed. We arrived on a Sunday afternoon (around 4ish) and found several couples waiting to be seated and were told that there was a 20 minute wait for 2, which was odd as there were several empty tables. The AC was not working and it was over 100 degrees outside which made the wait even worse. I was pleased with the Grapefruit margarita while we waited but then my hopes were dashed again as our waitress was very...forgetful? Ditzy? Lost? The menu was enormous and too confusing, the salsa was all very spicy (some people who enjoy Mexican food do not like super spicy), and the service was just pitiful. We waited 20 minutes to order, and then another 20 for a beer. The food was good, but overall it just was not worth everything we had to go through. I was looking forward to trying the Flan and having a nice, cool horchata for dessert only to find myself being disappointed again because they were out of flan and the horchata tasted like watered down milk. Needless to say I will not be coming back here again. My advice: if you have a few hours to kill: try going on a weekday in the middle of the day and hope for the best.
