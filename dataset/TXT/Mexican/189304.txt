oBABBuVRfIump4jHKlJmHg I have always been skeptical of Mad Mex just because Mexican food isn't my go to choice when eating out. I was very surprised and pleased with my visit.  The restaurant has an out door option which would be nice with a group of friends but for dinner for two I liked eating in. There is never much of a wait because service has always been quick. I really like the guacamole with chips or their wings for an appetizer. My main course is usually the same which may seem boring but hey I know what I like!  I get the tofu tacos and even writing about them now I'm craving them! The tofu is cooked perfect with a glaze that reminds me of a general tsos sauce. The soft shell tacos are topped with fresh bean sprouts a green salsa and some avocado. All of these ingredients working together makes for the best taco I've ever had. The meal also comes with rice black beans pico and I get sour cream.  Go try my favorite tofu taco! I'm now a Mad Mex fan!
