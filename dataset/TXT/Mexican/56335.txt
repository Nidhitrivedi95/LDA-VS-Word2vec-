a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg I agree with the previous comment: about not using the groupon! Tried it a few years ago and it was only ho-hum. Saw the groupon so figured at the price it was worth a date night try again. Service was great & Food was the same (see below) But they DID NOT HONOR THE GROUPON- all they did was take the price of the groupon OFF OF THE BILL!!!  (they took what we spent for the groupon & not the meals that it was supposed to cover. No discount given at all! ) We bought what we were supposed to, even double checked with the server...then bait and switch at bill time.  No savings here!

I wouldn't say amazing & I wouldn't say great. More like just good. Just good food. Staff was very friendly though. SAFE flavors for just about everyones taste buds. Tastes like it's all from a can or bag...infact, I found a 4 inch piece of plastic wrap in my cheese enchalada!!!!!

Not the best Mexican food in Vegas, but it's not the worst.  When you go into a Mexican resturant and full and it's all middle aged white people - that should tell you what you need to know;

Theres not much seasonings or variety in flavors, just staple 'expected' dishes that should be on a Mexican Resturants Menu.  Traditional combination plates (taco, burrito, enchalada, etc)  with a lot of cheese, not so much interest and tons of sauce to smother it. 

The "jumbo" margarita isn't.  Resturant is nice, clean and well decorated (except our table rocked a good 2 inches) and the staff was all very friendly.  Some confusion with the waiter though, I kept asking for two combination 31's. and he kept wanting to give me one combination 32....LOL.

There's so much better Mexican food in Vegas but I can see how this would be popular with the lunch work crowd. Those wanting the "Denny's" of Mexican food will love it. Those wanting something homemade and authentic will be disapointed. Even Robertos is better in flavor.
