DMmeFKsUuMl0kDy7Zd7W3A An interesting night landed us at Sandbar, even against better judgment.

My friend was kind enough to pay the $5 cover fee, which made it no less annoying.  Cover fees at bars without live music?  That's usually a deterrent for me.  I am just not the cover fee paying kind of gal.

We walked into a packed house of people my friend described as "at least double our age and wearing half the clothes."  Obviously, that's an exaggeration (but not by much).

The place was so smoky (yuck) and the ratio of men to women was probably 3:1. though the ratio of men to ladies was 3:1/4.

We stayed for exactly one drink, wherein my friend declared this was not her type of place.  I couldn't help saying "I told ya so," but she needed to see it for herself.  After last night, I am sure she won't be going back.  

The best part of this place?  Getting to talk about the clientele afterward.  

I'm not a fan.
