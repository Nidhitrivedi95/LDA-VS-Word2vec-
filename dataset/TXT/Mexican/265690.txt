wdCH53icp_R2jJDrCZk42g We heard the restaurant could be loud and a party leaving as we entered confirmed that two tables inside we very loud. We. Were taken to a table that we had to ask to have wiped off. Then I asked for a call tequila they only had 1800 and well not a good sign for a Mexican restaurant. After the food was delivered I began to notice how filthy the booth area was just filthy. I  also couldn't help but notice there wasn't a Mexican employee in the place .Bottom line I'll never recommend and I'll never return.
