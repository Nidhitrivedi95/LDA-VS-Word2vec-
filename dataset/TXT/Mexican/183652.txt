NOfbzTpQ7hrt6ZbJVeXUUw We came for lunch today and I was amazed. 
As soon as we came in someone greeted us by the door and walked us to a nice table outside.
It didn't take long and we had a waitress at the table.
Our waitress was Danielle, who was very courteous and was always checking on us. 

Our drinks came very fast, the same with our food and desserts.
We had ceviche which was perfect, spicy and tasty! They can make little adjustments if you request.
The food looks and tasty delicious!

The place is big and well organized. They have inside and outside sittings.
It's a nice place to have a long relaxed lunch or dinner. And we are definitely coming back!
