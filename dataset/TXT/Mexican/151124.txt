Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ I have tried to avoid Cabo Wabo Las Vegas the past six years because it looks like a giant tourist trap from the outside. Well, I finally caved in one day because I was starving for food and service attention especially after my dinner disaster at HEXX. 

From the hostesses, to the waitress to the busboys, everything was excellent. The staff members here are full of energy and provided our table with great service. I ordered the Cotija cheese crusted quesadilla w/ chicken and requested 2x rice, instead of the beans. I was surprised by how good it tasted. There was plenty of chicken and filling inside the quesadillas. The tortillas were grilled perfectly, with a great crispy texture. For the $15.95 price tag, it was a great deal considering we are in Vegas. My buddy ordered the burrito and enjoyed his food too. The only qualm I had was with the fountain Coca-Cola beverage I ordered. It was extremely watered down and lacked carbonation. 

Cabo Wabo Cantina, you did not disappoint me!
