zdE82PiD6wquvjYLyhOJNA We stopped for a quick dinner at Komex before a show around 6pm on a Tuesday. Surprisingly we were the only ones eating while we were there. The comp tortilla chips were freshly made and we ordered a variety of their fusion bulgogi Beef & chicken tacos while my wife also had  calamari & shrimp lettuce wrap.  You can taste the High quality ingredients used but adding their sweet sauce on the tacos made everything taste much more amazing. Depending on meat choice prices range $2-3 per taco, we wanted to stay and order more but we will definitely plan to return when in Vegas again!
