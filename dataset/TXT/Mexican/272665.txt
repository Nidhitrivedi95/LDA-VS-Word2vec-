WVAvGK24DQ9FdsEHBqIygQ I would say more of 3.5. The tacos are fantastic but super tiny. They try and make up for it by stuffing them so full you can't even pick them up to eat them. This of course causes a giant mess. But they are delicious. I would suggest a taco bowl over the tacos. Due to mess. Plus the price
Doesn't match the size. If they are going to charge as much as they do they need to change the tortilla
Size. 

The corn is the best thing on the menu. Seriously so addicting. Plus the atmosphere is really cute inside and a great chill place to sit with ppl and relax. 

Overall it's the better Mexican option if you are looking for something quick and tasty.
