wrVKiNlNI3xE302fDbrVBw I'm a big fan of burritos all together and this place is the best! When I went to gb this place was a just to go to on the reg. they have quite a few options for toppings and food items. It's a great student hub and a great grab a go spot before going to st James park. Service is super fast and always friendly. I really have only good things to say about this food spot :) I always go when in neck of the woods.
