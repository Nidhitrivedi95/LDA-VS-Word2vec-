tTR9GQbdC-rEHNsECmSWRw Excellent food and service.  Much more than you would expect at a hotel restaurant.  Wounderful setting facing Mummy Mountain.  At night they have live music, a really hopping scene.  Great for Lunch or Dinner (and breakfast).  If it is full, you can order from the menu in the bar and watch a game on the TV.
