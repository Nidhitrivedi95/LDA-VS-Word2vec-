TRjROoIwqKg76ZS53DN-Ww Worst location in town. Several bad experiences here, but tonight was the worst. After ordering and not getting a total, I pulled up to the window to pay- several people came and left inside. The cashier even came to the window register at one point, and after looking at me, put money in a letter envelope and then walked away. After over 10 minutes at the window without even an acknowledgment, my lunch was over and I had to leave without any food. 

At least I didn't have a chance to pay, I suppose. But definitely won't be going back to this location.
