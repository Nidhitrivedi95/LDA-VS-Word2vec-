4NxIM5xpIEem1IkEkz2I7Q I had lunch here when it first opened and it was great.  I have been back occasionally and the food is consistently authentic Mexican food and the wait staff take good care of you.  I have had Mexican food at other locations in Las Vegas, but  I think this place out  does the rest by far.  The prices are reasonable and they have a nice lunch menu.  I don't think you can go wrong with La Cabana.
