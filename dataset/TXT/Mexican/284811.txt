y0phdNciJfDRahaIpoqKkg What can I say?  The Jim Bean Bourbon Burger was calling me.  With a nice mix of the sweet   bourbon sauce in every bite, crunchy onion straws, and pepper jack made great toppings. Yes bacon, lettuce and tomato also join the meal, with such a fine mix of ingredients this burger did not disappoint.  A mighty fine burger from a fast food place.  With all that in it you will instantly go into a food coma once you finish it.  I needed a 1000 calorie burger so this fit the bill perfectly.  Without a meal all day Carl's Jr is my Kryptonite at times.  
If  you are looking for a satisfying meal I never go wrong at Carl's.  Plus this particular location is generally appointed with friendly staff and well cooked fries.  Yes I even had fries, might as well get a meal if your going to cheat on your diet.  Go all the way and enjoy a fast food treat, check this place out when you get hungry.
