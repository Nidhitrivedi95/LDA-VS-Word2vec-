24MgaUT4TWO3_kZQlBu8sw This store is a complete mess. Dirty. There is not one place to sit that is clean. It is Friday night at 6:15. long lines. Some guy just went off and said he's called ahead on 4 separate occasions and every time the never had his food. This looks like a high traffic store but badly managed. I hope this isn't a sign for CMG.
