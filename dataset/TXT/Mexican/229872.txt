sEvsx89wie9oSU5AlvCBGg Sad to give this place 3 stars but I just feel this location is lacking compared to the Mesa & QC locations. 
The vibe is casual, young, and comfortable. But the food has not been very impressive the last handful of times I've been here. 
Each time I've been in, it's empty to no crowd so I feel like the food just kind of sits waiting to be stirred up. The sweet pork was dry and hard in some parts. The pico seemed very watery. 
Today, I was thankful that the guy said the tortillas was too hard so he'd make me a fresh one for my burrito. 
It's nice that they do free cheese quesadillas for toddlers! 
This location is always clean! The staff is hit or miss for friendly tho.
