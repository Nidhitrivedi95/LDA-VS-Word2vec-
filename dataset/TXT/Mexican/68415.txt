bLRjPq9-pAdXirAWWTuZzg One star is a gift. 10 minutes plus and no drink order and the place was not busy. The only place this restaurant can continue to exist is terminal 3 of Sky Harbour. I've been here many times (the only place you can be "served" in terminal 3) and it is always slow and the people are never friendly.
