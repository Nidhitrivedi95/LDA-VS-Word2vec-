DMwU0igEs9K7XuI3utsr6g Came here because its seems they have good food and nice ambiance, however it was a horrible experience. We were there for 20 minutes before we got serviced. We have ordered and its been 40 minutes and our food is not here yet. Mind you this is at the terminal airport. So there goes our flight. Don't come here if you're in a hurry. The service is usually 2 hours minimum before you get served and food total. 2 hours minimum! Bad service! Really bad!
