First of all, I kind of hate Bobby Flay.   He just has a very punchable face.  Anyways, I digress...yes...Mesa Grill.  

I'm a bit embarassed to say that I liked Mesa Grill (I still hate you, Bobby).  It wasn't fantastic, but, pretty, pretty, pretty good.  3.5 stars.

My restaurant week menu included the following: (1) blue corn pancake with bbq duck; (2) the New Mexico spice-rubbed pork tenderloin with sweet potato tamale; and (3) mango buttermilk upside-down cake.  I also ordered a prickly pear margarita.

The bbq duck in the blue corn pancake was a bit sweet for me; I found myself struggling to finish it.  Probably wouldn't order it again.  The pork tenderloin entree include three huge portions of perfectly cooked, moist pork slabs.  Awesome.  Unfortunately, the sweet potato tamale that accompanied the pork (and impossible to open) was really dry and added nothing to the dish.  The mango buttermilk upside-down cake dessert was okay but was elevated to good by the delicious rum caramel glaze topping the cake and mango ice cream.

My prickly pear margarita was good but a tad sweet.  I probably prefer a more traditional margarita.

My boyfriend ordered the restaurant week menu with roasted corn soup,  Yucatan-style grouper, and key lime pie.  I took bites of his food and wished I had ordered his menu.  So, if you decide to try the Restaurant Week menu, I'd recommend you order his choice of dishes.

Bonus points to Bobby for not including any kokopelis or pictures of cacti in his restaurant.  I still hate it when you win throwdown.  That is all.
