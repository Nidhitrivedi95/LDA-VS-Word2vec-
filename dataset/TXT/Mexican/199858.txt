PCugqia4CsE9krMJyJ8UXw Typical airport food, was not expecting anything special when eating here. The customer service was great, very attentive employees and quick. The food quality was average, but at least it was not extra for guacamole. Overall a decent place to grab a quick bite before the plane ride.
