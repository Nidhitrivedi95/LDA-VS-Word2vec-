sEvsx89wie9oSU5AlvCBGg This place is seriously AMAZING. I'm SO glad it opened up so close to ASU campus!
Everything is good. My favorites are the raspberry chipotle chicken tacos, sweet pork tacos/salad, or the mango chicken salad. Although I do love a good taco (and this place certainly has it!), I was surprised by just how much food is in the salad. If you're really hungry, get it! Haven't tried the other menu options yet... I want to try a burrito next. Anyways, I'm not sure you can go wrong with this place.
The main reason this place gets five stars, though, is the customer service. I've seen some mixed reviews about their customer service here, but honestly, I'm not sure if they're true. I was stuck in the restaurant during an intense thunderstorm one night, and I was freaking out because I not only had to ride my bike to my class, but I had my computer and was afraid that it would get soaked in the rain. The manager came out and personally seran-wrapped my entire computer and phone, and then gave me some plastic bags to put my purse and computer in to ensure they would be protected from the rain.
Needless to say, Costa Vida has a customer for life. Not every restaurant would do something like that.
