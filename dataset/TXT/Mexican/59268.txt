AhPmh0NaRDbEYyhd9egzLA Oh my goodness!  Stop by here for a late lunch to dine here during their "happy hour" which includes $5 margaritas and $2 tacos!   
We started off with guacamole, it was unique with roasted corn, cojito cheese and tomatillos.   The crispy fish taco was flavorful and delivered exactly as it was described.  The braised beef taco was also bold in flavor, however the meat was much more chewy that it should have been.  The drinks were amazing and you can't go wrong with the happy hour price.  

The only downfall to Joyride is the service.  You don't have one waitress the entire time, so drinks may or may not be refilled and it might take a while for them to "check" on your table to see if you need anything or even take your order. 

Feeding 3, which includes 3 adult beverages and an appetizer for $38 made this place a little sweeter - you can't beat the happy hour prices at Joyride Taco House.   As long as you don't mind the service being inconsistent.
