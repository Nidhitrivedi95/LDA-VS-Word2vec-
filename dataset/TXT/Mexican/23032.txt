2lF1UsGcDpDpaI1lXgRX_g Great service, was greeted at the door. And seated right away.   With in  minutes   our order was being taken and chips and salsa were on the table.  I had the  steak fajita chimichanja.  It was very tasty,   I  stop in here a few times a year and food and service are always excellent.
