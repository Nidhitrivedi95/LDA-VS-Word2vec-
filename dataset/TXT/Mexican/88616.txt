dNDAdeE8olF4eZaslNtBZw Always was hit n miss with this place. Sometimes good food, sometimes bad service, etc, etc.  We went with a Groupon, "love em' and always r purchasing them for places", anyhow, this visit put the cherry on top and NONE of us will ever be back. We went more than 15 minutes right in the middle of our meal without drinks, we finally were able to finish our food. My sons rice was crunchy and the chips were half stale. The server was playing both waiter and cook. People waited to be seated and a guy finally walked all the way into the kitchen just to say they were there and sitting down. When our check finally came, my son said to the waiter "u took my crunchy rice and never brought out a replacement", the waiter took 2 bucks off the tab. Now for the cherry on top; I noticed an almost 10 dollar service "gratuity" charge on the bill, I was like what, there was only 4 of us, not 8 or 10??????????  The server/waiter/cook said that since we are using a Groupon that they charge an 18% service charge cause Groupon users don't tip right!!! We always tip accordingly and I was like: Hey, u didn't mention nor does the restaurant mention ANYWHERE that an automatic service charge is applied! They are thieves! I contacted Groupon last night and sent them copies of everything and today I'm contacting the BBB and the attorney generals office. Sad, sad, sad! At this rate, that manny's will go outta business. Don't go, save urself the frustration of feeling belittled and unimportant and ripped off!
