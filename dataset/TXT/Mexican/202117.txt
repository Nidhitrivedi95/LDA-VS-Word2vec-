PndkxtLCDv69LBE5Ay8Mwg Good food I had the carne asada burrito enchilada style and my husband had the El pastor tacos. Beans and rice just needed salt. Chips came out hot salsa was really good. Only issue is you can't use a Groupon with the lunch special. You have to order reg priced meal wish the t&c stated it but over all nice place
