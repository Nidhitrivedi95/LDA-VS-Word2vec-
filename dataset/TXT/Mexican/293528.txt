YYE0C8FeDpB6zqB0kSEh7w The husband and I ate a little early, three pm, and the place only had two tables occupied. Greeted immediately and seated by a very nice lady, Any.

Amy took our drink orders right away and came back a few minutes later and took our order.

Orders came out within ten minutes.

I had the Chimichanga stuffed with beans and carve adavado with Christmas sauce, red and green. The husband opted for the carve adavado with sides. Both meals were fresh and very tasty with those hatch chilis.

Used a Groupon for this visit and very happy with the whole experience. Will definitely go back.
