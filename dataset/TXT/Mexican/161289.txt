L-_-9JNAb6UDyq7waykX2A I never tried fried sushi.  And when I did it was very good and I was very impressed.. They are a little expensive though and wouldn't eat fried sushi all the time but this place is a place to go.. I didn't stay and eat I took my food to go but it was satisfying enjoyed it good place
