Or7FgbgY8ML30zgYj_DCwA Went on a Saturday night. Waited less than 5 mins without a reservation for 2. 

The food was very good. We had nachos + burritos + fish taco. The portions were VERY large. We ended up taking half of everything home. 

Only complaint is that it took longer than average for food to come (e.g. more than 30-40 mins). This seemed to be common amongst all the tables. However, we weren't very bothered by it as the environment was quite enjoyable.
