F-PmkzyN80fVcNMN8Z2aiw Great service from the girl who led us to our table, and also our server Jacob!! He was so sweet and friendly, and always made sure our drinks were filled and we were satisfied with food.

Margaritas were just as great as I remembered.. I just wish there was a slightly better happy hour deal on food.. I feel like it's still pretty expensive for happy hour but I love Z Teja's so of course I will be back!
