FGaaHr_krwaPGlD0mHPe4Q I have been coming to Matta's since birth.  The food has always been great. The hot sauce is great.  The service can be hit or miss.  Seems to be a lot of turnover lately.
Now for the food! Do yourself a favor and explore a bit. Bi have seen some reviews about queso dip and samer platters.  This is not tex-mex.  It is Sonoran Mexican. The Alibondiga soup is the best I have ever had.  The chile reyenos are incredible. The ground beef tacos are not a favorite of mine but I don't really like ground beef tacos anyway.  The Roberts tacos are great and I highly recommend them.
The food is pretty consistent, I think the service is better in the bar and you can always get seated.
