3lRFcrfR3IrSAQJtrnn80A This is my favorite place to eat breakfast! The place is very welcoming and the food is delicious. When I eat here I feel like I'm at my grandmas home eating. The food taste like it's home maid. And the people that work there are always friendly and nice every time! I have not had a single complain ever!  I come here every week. I recommend this restaurant to everyone.
