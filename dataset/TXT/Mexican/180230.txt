N5CL5HLS6lyltw-OjjBrOw After reading the reviews I was skeptical but we came for a late lunch on a Sunday. It wasn't packed but started to after we sat down. We got the elote grilled corn and it was delicious. We also got the guacamole and it was good too, not to much tomatoes like I had read on a previous review. The chips were warm and fresh and it also came with 3 additional salsas. I got the grilled shrimp Baja tacos and my hubby got the ribeye tacos, spicy but also very good. We would definitely be coming back. Also our server was great she wasn't slow and was attentive.
