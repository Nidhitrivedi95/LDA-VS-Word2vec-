qRUEQowj9yuV-HFwm9wZXw Great food and fast service. Went in for early take out at 4:30 pm.  Not busy. Had chimichangas , rolled tacos and small mex hat salads. Oh and chips and salsa!  All was really good. Portion were plentiful. Gave us plenty of guac and sour cream. I'll return when in town again.
