svdEhLmNmpVaIv1WLtoOvQ I am so over this place. They cannot get an order correct to save their lives and they are cheap on ingredients. 

Queso Fundido--about a spoonful of cheese and the rest meat and tomatoes.

Chicken Tinga--supposed to have avocado on it (it's a $3 small taco). It has 3 specks of avocado. CHEAP ON INGREDIENTS!!!

Lengua Taco--its supposed to have cilantro but has none on it.

Queso Modelo--I did not order to ugh but half the time do, it doesn't come with chips and it's supposed to. 

I'm over this place. I have given this place so many chances. I will no longer order from here.
GET IT TOGETHER!
