Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ Can't say enough about Javier's - would give it a 4.75 if possible. Only drawback was the level of noise and - maybe - the lighting. The server - absolutely tremendous - had a flashlight at the ready so we could read the menus.

Food was excellent; everyone at our table ordered the Carnitas and all all raved about it. Will return next time in Vegas - no questions!
