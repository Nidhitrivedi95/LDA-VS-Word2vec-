HGLMe4y0y_VsBkDLdpfBLA We brought Out-of-towners from the midwest here for a night of comedy and dinner at Papi Chulo's Mexican Grill. One friend had Shredded Pork Taco dinner, another had the Tortilla Soup  which was delicious; still another friend had a chicken wrap with fries.  The service was attentive friendly and fast.  Very good food!!
