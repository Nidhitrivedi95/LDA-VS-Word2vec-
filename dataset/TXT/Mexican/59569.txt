She got the blood orange which I tasted and it was tasty as well. She wanted the cucumber serrano, but she was unable because they didn't have the ingredients ready. That was kind of a bummer because she was talking about it before we got there.  We got the lunch special,  2 tacos and choice of soup or salad. I did the adobada and crispy fish tacos with one of their salads. Food quality and taste were all great. Good place to stop for lunch and a drink.
