q6BiPGNf2ANWkwal9HPkQg Not a huge Mexican food fan, I haven't been here in years.  Went an hour before closing on a Monday for some margaritas.  Very friendly employees that didn't hate us for arriving so close to closing.

 Got some chorizo con queso dips and chips with the complimentary salsa.  Food was good, although heavy cheese with sausage isn't exactly the perfect pair with a margarita.  My fault on that one. 

I'd frequent more if I had a taste for Mexican.
