-kTHAUKuzh7cFZjVAW55Ug I only come to this chipotle because it's at the end of my street and it's an easy cheap meal. Every single time I've been there, there's one or two people moving the line along, and plenty of other staff literally just standing around talking to each other. Last night I was in line for almost 15 minutes and there were only probably 6 people in front of me, and the employees were constantly stopping to talk to each other. There's only one friendly male who is usually working the register, other than him everyone else looks to be miserable. Needs new management.
