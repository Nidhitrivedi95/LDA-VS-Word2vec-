knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw The food was just okay. My tacos kept falling apart so ended up just making a taco salad instead  but if you go for the drinks, you won't be disappointed. I enjoyed my alcohol far more than my meal but for what you pay and what you get I have no complaints. I'm shocked to see this place has such a low review rate.
