iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg I don't eat seafood, but HAD to try the ceviche and damn, that was delicious.  I don't' think I'd try it elsewhere, but had to try it here as I kept hearing how delicious it was and the rumours were true. Wish the place was bigger as it's something I like to eat fresh, so if you don't get a seat you are out of luck. Great food, thank you!
