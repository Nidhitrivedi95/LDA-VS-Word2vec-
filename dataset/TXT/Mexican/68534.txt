bMSiHjs2fbKbBNPyuTwhHA Honestly this place was the worst service I've ever experienced. We came here for my boyfriends birthday thinking it would be the perfect spot for a patio drinks and good food. When we FINALLY got the food ( three out of five orders completely wrong) we were so hungry we ate anyways so we could build up the energy to let the manager know how horrible the entire experience was. She not only made it worse she over charged all of us twice making the checking out process take AN HOUR. We will never be back the food is soggy, drinks are weak, and the manager is a troll. We did tip our server because she clearly was not trained by said manager and was being tortured along with us. BARIO FOR LYFE.
