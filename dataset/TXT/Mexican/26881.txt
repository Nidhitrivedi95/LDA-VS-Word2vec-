3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ Listen, I am a taco enthusiast. And even though I prefer the traditional street tacos, this places takes it to a different level. I was impressed. Obviously they are always crowded for a reason. And of course I had to try the Pastor, but also decided to try the duck. Duck in a taco... What! And I got it in a lettuce leaf. What! They though about us carb watchers. Excellente!
