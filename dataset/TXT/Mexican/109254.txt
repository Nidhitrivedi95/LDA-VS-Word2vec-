Problem is that their service was S-L-O-W.  At lunch hour, there were maybe 30 people in the dining room (it looks like it will hold about 100).  There were at least 5 front of the house servers plus the manager/owner, Mr. Ortega.  There was an 8 top and around 6 tables of 3-4 including ours.  We sat down at around 11:50 and didn't get out until 1:10.  This was because we waited for our food, and then waited again when we went to check out.  The entire server staff seemed weeded by serving the 8 top.  Then, after those people left, another 8 top of actual Mexican men came in, and the flirting with the female servers made our wait time increase.  Once we were ready to check out, our water busied himself with inputting the orders for the new 8 top, and the manger/owner stood there while we waited.  Finally, our waiter got up and went to the kitchen without ringing up our tabs, and the manager/owner took a sip of his comp drink.  When we asked if he could help, he was super nice, but it was a bit odd that he didn't think it strange that we three gringos were just standing there doing nothing.

So, in the final analysis, Mi Pueblo has good food, but don't go if you are on a schedule.  The servers were nice, and so was the owner/manager, and I would say that my experience there was overall positive, but I did get back to work later than I wanted to.  (they did seem to know that they were slow, because they gave us free soup and an extra basket of tabletop nachos while we waited...)
