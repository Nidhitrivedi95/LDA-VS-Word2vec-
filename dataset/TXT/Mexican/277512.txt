Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ This week I had family come into town, and We decided to give this place a second chance. Last time I was here, our food took over an hour when the restaurant was almost empty, and my food wasn't hot at all. However, this was definitely better than the last time we were here. 

Even though they were packed, the hosts managed to seat us quickly, although there was some confusion as to who our server was. I got the tamarindo margarita, which was a little sweet for my taste, but it was pretty strong as well. 

Their chips and salsa are freshly made. They do have a habanero salsa if you like things spicy. I am warning you, it is spicy. And I love spicy. So use with caution

Both Jacob and his dad ordered the chile verde which I believed they both loved as they left their plates empty when we left. The food did take around half an hour, but they were really clear about the time it would take. 

I ordered the Cabo Azul and it is absolutely delicious. It is a big portion as it comes with a lobster and shrimp enchilada, lobster stuffed chile relleno, rice, beans and a fish taco. I do recommend either sharing this, or taking it home. The fish taco was amazing as well as the chile relleno, I did wish the stuffing for the enchilada had more flavor, but the sauce was really good. I would definitely recommend this place
