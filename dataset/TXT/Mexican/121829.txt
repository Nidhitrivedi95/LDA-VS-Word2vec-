HaOvuZUzCLbObQfT8H44fw We used an Entertainment coupon, she accepted it no problem. My dad ordered the chile rellenos and I got the carne asada plate. The first thing to go were the beans on my plate which were delicious. The corn and flour tortillas are excellent. We got big portions, probably could have split one plate but decided to pig out since we had the coupon. Salsa bar is decent, the hot does have some kick. The tables could have been more clean, and the staff more friendly, but overall a good value for the money.
