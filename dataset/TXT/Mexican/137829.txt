Iu2ZINWwyrt9gXliykBEKQ I would have moved this to a 4 star but the food was not hot enough when it was served. I had the 3 type burrito which certainly had the taste factor. They also had the very BEST retried beans I've ever had from any Mexican Restaurant. They also had great tasting Margaritas served in a glass or pitcher. The pitcher was $45.00/pitcher btw. All in all it was good but not great cause of the temp of the food.
