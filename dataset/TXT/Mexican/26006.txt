I had the most adventurous tacos with duck, and lamb. Also the al postore which was really good.  Portions were excellent. Good value for the money. Service also was excellent.  The two things I didn't like is how loud it was (dang it I'm getting middle aged) and there wasn't enough of the hot sauces. They only refilled the main one,  which was really good,  but I enjoyed them all and wanted more. I will definitely go back.
