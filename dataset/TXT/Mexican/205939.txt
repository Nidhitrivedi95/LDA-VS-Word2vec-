pyeoyouJWxxcwzfugfessQ We hit happy hour. The carne Asada street tacos were delicious.  Not a great beer selection but they served flights of tequila.  Eeeek.  I would like to go back and try some different foods.  I will have to say that their barstools are the absolute worst. They are cheap metal barstools.......everybody was complaining about them and sliding off of them.  We would've definitely stayed longer if the seats weren't so miserable.  The service was average .....not fantastic but not terrible.
