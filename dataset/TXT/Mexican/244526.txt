tjw1yJdmatifLYHbsI9HGA You know... I didn't have high expectations for By the Way because of its yelp aggregate at 3 stars and the description of "Mediterreanean/Middle Eastern" food didn't tickle my fancy for breakfast.

Anyway, I was blown away by both the service and food! It was busy, we got lucky and were seated right away. I got the chorizo mushroom havarti omelette, which is one of the best omelettes I've had in a long time. My girlfriend got the huevos rancheros (or whatever it's called), which she liked... but she definitely liked my omelette more because she stole about half of it. It's okay, the meal comes with homefries AND a bagel! Nice touch, reminded me of montreal. So even though my girlfriend disregarded my love for breakfast, decided I'm fat enough and ate my food, I still walked away satisfied.. MORE than satisfied. This place will now sit high on my list of choices for breakfast on the weekend!
