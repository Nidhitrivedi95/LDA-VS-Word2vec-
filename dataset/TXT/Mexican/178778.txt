MyTsAeShB9pcWP84GSTAdw I love Korean and Mexican food! Whoever thought of this was a genius! I found Komex on yelp and went on a Sunday evening. We went at around 6pm and it slowly got packed. We ordered the bulgogi (beef and chicken), fried rice, fish lettuce wrap, spam musubi and wonton soup. Everything was pretty tasty but my favorite was the fried rice. It was hot, fresh, flavorful, and had tons of beef, chicken and shrimp. Service was excellent and the portions are very big. We ordered 1/2 orders and still had leftovers. Prices are also reasonable for the amount of food you get. I love their food and will definitely be back when I'm in town.
