ifUpNwfgLysVh3nd2p6VrA I recently went to the reopened establishment (new management) and hope that they do well.

The service was excellent and I could tell that it was a family franchisee.

Slightly cheaper than mucho burrito which has been around longer in the area.

Suggestion - offer to warm up / toast the taco shells.  Takes 20-30 seconds in a toaster oven and makes them much tastier.

I wish them the best but they are stuck in a plaza that is quite far from the main road; in a corner so you'll have to be looking for them to see them.
