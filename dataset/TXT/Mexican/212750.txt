QteBKpZTRa2dJ3u7MLiXww After this spot I'm going to hate Mexican food. I ordered the Plato which included one meat I chose chicken, rice, refined beans ( disgusting ) and a side salad. Everything was just pure wrong except for my pinapple drink.  I do not recommend this place to no one, unless you want to have some disgusting Mexican food than you are more than welcome.
