9Q1ZtzTPFWG4fJiFSko5Xg I had lunch with my parents here just yesterday and it was an awful dining experience. I used to be a fan but it's been quite a while since the last time I came to a Cantina Laredo. It was about 12:30pm, not very busy but I sat and waited (my parents weren't there yet) to be helped since there was no hostess when I walked in. I sat for 10 minutes before anyone came by to seat me. And yes, I saw at least 2 people look my way. That already rubbed me the wrong way. The food was also lackluster. The table side gauc was bland and lacked salt, however, the "spicy" and medium salsa were too salty. My dad told our waitress that the spicy salsa was not spicy and that it was too salty and she just laughs and says "ok, I'll be right back". A warm salsa is brought over and I was thinking, isn't this the same crap? Like warming it up is going to change the saltiness. Then when she takes our orders, I asked how many shrimp came with the shrimp salad. She answers "5" so I said yes, as that is what determined my answer. We get our food and after I ate the first shrimp I combed the salad to count the rest and there were only 3 left. I let her know when she came back around but instead of an apology she says "my bad, I'll get you another one" without making eye contact and swiftly turns the other direction. I had to go shortly after because I had to get back to work so my parents told me they ended up eating the 1 shrimp they brought back. It pisses me off that they charge $14 + for 4 pieces of average sized shrimp in limp leaf salad. Throwing in extra chunks of canned or leftover pineapple doesn't make up for how overpriced it is. That's all I could think about while I was eating it. If I didn't have to go back to work I would have talked to the manager. It's so annoying to deal with impolite staff on top of below-average food.
