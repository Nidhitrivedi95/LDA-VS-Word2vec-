knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw We were seated and after 15 minutes no one came to give us water even, although 2 servers were working tables around us. We had to go back to the hostess station to ask to be re-seated (don't sit in the downstairs, it is dark and gloomy) and the hostess acted like it was no big deal we were ignored. We were re-seated but even after that the service and food were really sub par. And they were out of lots of the items on the menu (or didn't prepare them anymore).
We would not return.
