e2ApirIzYID9xIye0r_gKQ I can always count on Farmer Boys! They are consistent and delicious! It's always clean inside and the staff is friendly. Everything I've had there has been good, but I was pleasantly surprised by the fish and chips. Not only is it good, but to get it in a drive through makes it even better.
