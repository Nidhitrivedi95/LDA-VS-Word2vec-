GpX1PmgplBrG_DLiJVDC-g Do not waste your money on this run down place with substandard food. There was insulation panels" for artwork that looked like what I get out of the lint-catcher in my dryer,  the waitress brought the wrong order for one of us, the short rib tacos was one piece of meat and not shredded and impossible to eat in taco form and had BBQ sauce on it - really BBQ sauce in a Mexican restaurant? 

The canned beans were just that. They were very stingy with the cheese as if they had not gone grocery shopping over the weekend and were running out.  The rice had canned peas throughout and was completely unforgettable, except for the after-taste.  The enchilada with red sauce was tasted by those at the table and all agreed that the aroma was so much like a bad perfume tester at the mall and so incredibly sweet that it was inedible.  

To add insult to injury their own Maitradee' came by and saw it left on the plate and asked if they wanted it boxed up and she told him it was inedible and all he could say is she should have ordered it with the green sauce...so he knows the food sucks and still continues to work there! Final words as we walked to our cars were - "We hope we don't get sick from what little we ate."

This will also make me very hesitant before purchasing a  Deal Chicken coupon just for the deal!
