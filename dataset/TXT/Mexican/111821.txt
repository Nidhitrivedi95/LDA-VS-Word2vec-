g384tK63QxXXm3UNhtGMuA Food was excellent! I would suggest  a medium soft drink instead of a small cup. If there was a bigger cup size it wasn't offered. Also need a hook in the ladies room to hang your purse. Love the look of the place and it's open patio, very clean and good music. It also has a nice open bar. Staff was friendly! Definitely will return.
