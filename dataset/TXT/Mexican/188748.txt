OA5Li3ySzhrbG_WvD_QGYA I can't get enough of this place! It is the bomb! They have the best happy hour that has $3 margaritas and $3 tacos. The green goddess taco is to die for. It's only $1 extra and it has a soft taco with guac and cheese sauce and then a hard shell taco in it. I'm so glad I decided to try it! Their house margaritas are really good but they also have a wide variety of other flavors.

Since this place is so good, it is very popular and frequently busy. You can only get the happy hour deals if you sit at the bar or the tables in the bar room. It's worth the wait for a spot to open up if you get there and it's full. The bartender we had was okay, wasn't the friendliest fella but I didn't mind because the food and drinks did not disappoint. I was able to get a buzz and dinner for $10 - you can't beat it! I can't wait to check out the Lakewood location next.
