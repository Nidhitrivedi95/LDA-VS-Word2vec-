gsCOklDm1pbx3Tzo3W-mtw I hate only giving three star reviews, but it really was mediocre at best.

We came here for lunch along with a few sporadic customers.  When I can park next to the disabled parking that should have been my first clue, but we are determined to keep trying new places in the area and plan A was closed for lunch.  

The decor was cute, but the tables and booths have seen a lot of wear and tear.  On the plus side it was very clean.  The bathroom smelled like cleaner rather than a bathroom.  Service was immediate with a piping hot bowl of tortilla chips a bowl of white dip and some mild salsa.  I'm not a jalapeño lover, but even I like a little heat with my salsa.  The white stuff-it was questionable.  It was cold, not spicy nor did it taste like ranch or cheese sauce...a mystery we didn't bother to solve as the taste wasn't worth it.

Prices are affordable at least-under ten dollars per meal and the portions were large.  I ordered a burrito fajita with chicken.  The chicken and vegetables were hot and slightly seasoned, the shell tasted like a tortilla shell, but the rest was a meh.  Yeah it's refried beans and fried rice, but I was hoping for a little heat or seasoning?  

While the table service was pleasant I went to pay for my bill and wasn't acknowledged by the hostess until she finished charging the bill before mine, printed out my receipt and said a quick "thank you have a great day" as she was walking away.   I'm sorry she didn't care enough to listen to me say a kind reply.  Perhaps she was too busy with her other customers?
