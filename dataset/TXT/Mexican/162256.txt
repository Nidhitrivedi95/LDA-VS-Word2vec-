L2iT7pipc455Tgpbo35_mw I have now been there 3 times and each time is it getting worse and worse.  They could possibly have the worst service of any restaurant I have ever been to.

Last time I sat at the bar with a friend and watch our food sit on the counter for 10 minutes when the bartender finally turned around and realized there was food on the counter.

Today we went and sat on the roof. We ordered at 12:15 and by 1:00 we were still waiting for our Mac and Cheese Burrito.  The server told us they had a big party while the owner then came over and told us the health inspector shut the kitchen down for a half hour.  Either way I will not be back.

Only good if you have at least 2 hours to kill for lunch
