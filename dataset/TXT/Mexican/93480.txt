e4NQLZynhSmvwl38hC4m-A I truley wanted to give this AMAZING tasting taco joint 5 stars, until....
I went back to order another few tacos, so my significant other handed me a $50 dollar bill, which I barley glanced at because it was part of our money we traded earlier.. The older lady at the cash register saw this apparently because when i ordered my second round of tacos and paid for it, she handed me back cash as if it was a $20 bill that I handed her.  It took several second to sort it out until she handed me back the right amount of change.
...just saying... she was very apologetic.  YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE
