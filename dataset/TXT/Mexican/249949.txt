Uj77Cm-azkhW-F-vMIBbfg Just had a steak burrito, which was just as good as the famous Mission burritos I had on a recent trip to San Francisco.  I've also had tacos and a sope which were all good. My daughter loves the tongue quesadilla. The tripe is good too - pieces are just the right size and they are cooked crisp. Seating is limited, as it's in a small market. High chairs are available.
