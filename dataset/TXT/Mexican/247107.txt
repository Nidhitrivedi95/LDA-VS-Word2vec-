TxQBdyDktZSk1KVTWh71dw Underwhelming. The ambiance is cute and the service was good. The guacamole had no flavor - it's made at the table which is the most exciting aspect of it. No flavor. Same with the queso. The tacos we had were fine. For the price it's not really worth it- Bakersfield down the road is better. I'm
Hoping the food gets better after a few weeks though, I really want to like it here.
