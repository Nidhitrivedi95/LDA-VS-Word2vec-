uanXiHUBGq-6e6n5XwhzhA Purchased a number 5 meal beef taco with enchilada and beans and rice. Also purchased a Separate cheese quesadilla and a separate shrimp taco. Spent about 16 to $17 on all this food. My one beef taco with cheese, enchilada looked and tasted as if it came out of a banquet frozen dinner (only took two bites.....), cheese quesadilla was okay nothing special, and lastly the shrimp taco lacked flavor due to the fact it was mostly rice with barely any Pico and shrimp...... Feel free to give it a try . I personally hate spending lots of money on food that looks and tastes of failure
