DaVTuhzi6EgWStb2eAjNjA I bought a taco and was disappointed to find it was a street taco. Taking a bite, it was one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. The food is very authentic and is the best I've had this side of Tucson (maybe including Tucson!). Service was great and I was made to feel at home. I can't wait to go back! 

Presidio is located right across the street from St. Joseph's Hospital and is next door to a medical supply store.
