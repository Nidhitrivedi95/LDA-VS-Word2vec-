QMaaLfedGzNhHz6PZKAUkw I've probably been to 30 locations, but I'm going to rate this one because this is where I first got to know Filiberto's.  I'm a huge fan of the Super Nachos, the Bacon Burrito, and the Carne Asada fries (which are really nothing but super nachos where the tortilla chips are replaced by french fries).  

This place is very affordable for the amount of calories you get.  Fili's may not have some of the bells and whistles that you expect from other national fast food chains like Taco Bell or McDonald's, but in my eyes, it doesn't get better than some carne asada fries washed down by a tasty horchata from Filiberto's.
