9HvMGpZL20cs8YuNfdYBmw We recently dined at this location. Upon receiving our food, we noticed a mistake in the order. We brought it to the attention of the manager. Her name was Carrie, and she was very gracious, going above and beyond to make things right. It made the experience pleasurable in spite of the mistake. We will definitely be dining here again!
