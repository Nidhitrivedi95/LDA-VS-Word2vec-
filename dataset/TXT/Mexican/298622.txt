zJGtD3y-pAIGNId4codEEg My fiancé and I want to love this place, as it is walking distance from our house. However, time after time, we just get disappointed. The "to go" items are incredibly small, much differently proportioned the items in house. We have had many experiences with incorrectly prepared to-go" orders and, again, disappointed in the small size of salads and entrees. If they want to compete with all of the new restaurants in 7th street, they need to up their game.
