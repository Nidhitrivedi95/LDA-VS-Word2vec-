gldPX9ANF5Nic0N7igu2og First visit to Condado Tacos was a relatively good one. We walked in and immediately heard how loud it was and requested to sit outside. Outside tables were clean and comfortable. Our waiter did seem to forget us for a few minutes while we were waiting to place our order, but we understood as it was a busy Friday night. Food wise, we ordered queso blanco as an appetizer that was delicious. The chicken is fantastic. Lots of choices for building tacos that it's almost hard to choose! Friendly staff, good food, great downtown location.
