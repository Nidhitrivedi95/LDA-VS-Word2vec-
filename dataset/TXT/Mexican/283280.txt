XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Decided to try Mesa Grill, knowing it's a Bobby Flay joint. We were not disappointed. Had the tiger prawn tamale and lobster mini tacos for appetizer, both were super flavorful. Tacos had some kick, and the tamale was smooth and rich. Had the tuna steak and the bourbon ancho pork tenderloin. Both were incredible. You know you're getting flavor at a Bobby Flay place and Mesa delivered.
