ERM603jbIbNqX2c7Ww1Qiw So its hard to mess up an order at Café Rio. You order what you want. You customize it how you want. You go through a line to make sure they are making it how you want it. The food itself is delicious. So whatever you get, you can't go wrong. The only thing is that the inside is a little messy. I think they're just crazy busy and the volume is so high, they don't have time to keep it tidy. The décor could use some work; it looks like a kid dumped some paint on the chairs and someone else picked up some decorations that they had stored in their closet, and that's it. But, food wise, its an A+!
