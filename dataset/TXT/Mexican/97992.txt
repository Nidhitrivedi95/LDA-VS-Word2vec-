ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA I want to love this place so much but it's been hit or miss the two times I've been. The atmosphere is fantastic and so are the drinks. If you are looking for a place to meet up with some friends and have a few drinks, then this is definitely the place to go. But, the food is just so so and the service is spotty. On my first visit we just had drinks, which were great, but the service was pretty bad ( had to find someone for water, another drink, to pay, etc). On my second visit service was great but the food was so so. I liked the fried zucchini. My husband had the ribeye and it wasn't just really fatty, it was kind of grisly. I had the Asian chicken dumpling soup- they aren't actually dumplings, more like chicken meatballs. That's fine, but the broth was way too sweet. It was missing that umami taste that a good hot pot has.

Anyway, I really really want to put this place on my go to list because it's got such a great vibe. But, I can't justify paying $120 plus for drinks and so so food.
