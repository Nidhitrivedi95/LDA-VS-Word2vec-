xvrkd0c5E7sl9KuY-IMHIA I keep giving this location a chance cause I like their food, but I just don't understand why the service is so bad. Twice now I have sat at the drive thru with no car in front of me and not been able to place my order for five minutes or so. I actually think the first time I was left sitting there for 10-15 min. I thought this was a fast food place. Then when I pull up to the window I can see that there are only a few customers inside. I really don't get it, cause these last two times I was there between 6p and 8, so not odd times to grab a meal. This last time I ordered the cheeseburger meal. No one asked me if I wanted ketchup or any dipping sauce, so when I got home I had no ketchup for my fries and I'm pretty sure napkins are a staple for a to go meal, but I could be wrong.

This is the closest location to me unfortunately and it hasn't always been bad. It got like this with in the past few months, but is probably the reason why it is never close to busy when I have been there.
