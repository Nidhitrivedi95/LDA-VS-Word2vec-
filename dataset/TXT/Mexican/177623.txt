mswelTP1cQiuAps2fSGuBw It wasn't the worst. That's all I have to say about that.

Nah, I'll say a few more things...

The menu is for sure a little over-whelming for a first timer. The salads, which all look really good, are a tad bit too pricey for me. It's lettuce, c'mon peeps. 

Now. I had the regular cheeseburger and was very disappointed. The burger patty was pre-formed (boo) and cooked correctly, but the bun was cold and tough. Me no likey. Nothing about the burger made my mouth water.

I ordered my burger with onion rings. Some people like them thick, some thin. I am on team THIN. Don't get the onion rings here if you like 'em thin. They are over an inch and a half wide with an enormous amount of breading on them. You actually need to cut them to be able to dip them into any sauce.  It's like they cut a whole onion in half and began to drop them into the frying batter. There was so much batter that the onion barely cooked. Gross. 

I may give them another chance because my friend Mark B. is a real burger lover and we promised to take him there to try the burgers. 

I would not recommend this place to anyone who wants to get blown away by awesomeness. Rather, if you'd like to revisit the leather strap that daddy spanked your buns with as a child, order the onion rings.
