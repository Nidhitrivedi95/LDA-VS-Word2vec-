_XN-GwzZwAyIqLKJsl2htg Update: I had to take it from 5 to 4 stars because I did NOT like BRUNCH and if you going during the brunch menu (also on holidays), you are required to eat it (or a VERY limited bar menu). After trying it twice, I will never go there for brunch again, but will continue to go when there is a full menu. 

PREVIOUS REVIEW (during Happy Hour): I am now a complete fan. I am excited it was so close to my home! The cocktails are so varied and all quality. The food was good. The guac was simple but yummy. The salmon avocado role was fine -- nothing special. I absolutely will be going back!
