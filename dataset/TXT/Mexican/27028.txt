3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ I love this place it is my favourite place to eat.  We stopped by here after a meeting with a customer.  I got the chicken taco and two pork tacos.  They were good.  The chips and salsa were yummy as always too.  The server did a great job.  

I read the reviews and think some of them are unfair.  If you go to anyplace and wait a unreasonable amount of time and no one makes contact with try this.  Get up and go tell one of the staff.  It is simple.  I never have this problem for some reason.  

This place is really good.  I have always had good service here.
