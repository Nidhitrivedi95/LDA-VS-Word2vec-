Voeq7aGDmCGMjE_SQiHwRA Came here last night (a Sunday) on a date and the place was jam packed with a 30 minute wait. The overall ambiance of Bakersfield is great and I love their little boot steins for beer. It's so Texas! After living in Austin for 4 years, it tends to be hard to please me when it comes to tacos, so I'm basing it on that. 

First, our server was really friendly and gave good service, but she got our order wrong. My date ordered 3 tacos and I ordered 2, and they brought out 4 on a tin tray and 2 of them were incorrect. We asked the runner which tacos were which and then she ran back to the kitchen to grab the other. The server came over and apologized for the mistake, so no biggie on that!

I had one of the mole tacos and an al pastor. The mole was pretty good and the pastor with the pineapple was awesome. My only complaint is that the tortilla was a little dry. 

I would return here and get some different items. All in all a good experience!

Note: In a previous reviewers post she said that the restaurant didn't use the NoWait app, however, they have changed that. We used it last night and were notified at the time we were to be seated via that app.
