Voeq7aGDmCGMjE_SQiHwRA When you book a group of 15 at Downtown's hottest new haunt, you don't really know what you're going to get. Will everyone like it...will the service be good for a group...etc. The reviews from my group when were were all said and done were a bit mixed. It seemed like those of us who ordered the Selections of the House ($15/person for a sampling of almost the entire menu) were very pleased. Those who didn't were not pleased. I was among the "House" people and I LOVED it. For $15 we were given hearty portions of chips, guac, queso (with a delightful crisped cheese top), a pretty amazing salad, and a variety of tacos including veggie, pork belly, chicken and short ribs. We were all so stuffed, I had leftovers to take home. I also thought our server, JB, was a delight. Those who ordered a la carte seemed a bit disappointed with their meals, and had some concerns over drink mistakes, etc. In addition, it did take us a full 3 hours to get in and out - something to keep in mind if you have time constraints. I would definitely love to go back, but will always come en masse, so that I can take advantage of the Selections menu (for parties of 6+). Thanks, Bakersfield, for an awesome birthday outing!
