O_UC_izJXcAmkm6HlEyGSA By far, the most delicious Mexican food in the city. The biggest problem is that there's no air conditioning, or at least, no air conditioning that guests can FEEL. 

I strongly suggest guac and chips, the fried fish tacos, and any of the absolutely massive and delicious burritos!
