eJPckkV1k7gn0V2awA1pzA Almost exactly like the other location "Soho Sushi Burrito" sushiburrito-wise, except this one adds more focus to their bowls, which I'm a bigger fan of! The staff here is no different - quick and courteous. The girl that made my bowl still referred to the recipe, but she put the ingredients together very quickly. She reminds me of Jessica Sanchez...

Anyway, I ordered the Hilo Poke Bowl with white rice, since it sounded like it came with basic, traditional toppings. If you're like me and don't care for crazy toppings, you will enjoy the Hilo poke bowl. It's made with yellowtail, green onions, red onion, black pepper, sesame soy sauce, and mixed seaweed (unique blend... I think I saw ogo in there). I didn't add anything else, and it doesn't need anything else!

They don't skimp out on the amount of fish, although they are cut into much smaller pieces, which you may or may not like. Personally, I like bigger pieces since you get more of the fish flavor and texture, but smaller pieces also mean they won't easily fall out of your sushi burrito.

I will definitely come back here, especially since it's a couple of blocks from home.
