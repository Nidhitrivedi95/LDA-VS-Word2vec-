P8lGz3aiwedtGQWrifuBTA Revolting experience. This place was fantastic as Tradiciones, but the new menu and staff are awful. We ordered four different types of enchiladas and they were all terrible. They tasted like a bad recipe that was not made by a Mexican. They had ONE waitress for the entire dinner service, so needless to say it took a long time to get a drink and then our food. Also, there were two Asian people who clearly own/run the place that were walking around and  chewing ice cubes and then spitting them into a cup in their hand. Gross, not what I want to see while I am waiting to eat. 

So, Mexican restaurant owned and run by Asian people. Not authentic, not tasty, and the service sucked. We won't be back. RIP Tradiciones.
