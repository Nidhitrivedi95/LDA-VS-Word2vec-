I ended up trying their normal burger and it came with 2 meat patties and the bun was toasted well. They have a variety of burgers and I'll definitely be back to try more. 

The aesthetics could use a little work. I appreciate that the utensils and to go boxes were extremely accessible, but if you're expecting a super fancy burger place, then you'd be disappointed. It's a little dinky but go for the food and not for the aesthetics.
