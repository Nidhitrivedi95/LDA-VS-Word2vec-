_u1Bq7QsgMUXSMex8QHqLQ Talk about getting some bang for your buck! One burrito from here (even a "small") is enough to last you comfortably through two meals... Possibly three, depending on your appetite. 

Service is fairly quick, even when it's packed, and the employees are very friendly. The cook especially. He is pretty entertaining to watch as he bops around the kitchen to whatever song is on, and he often gets creative when calling out order numbers. 

But the food is the main attraction - obviously. You have to get the halibut burrito. Seriously. I'm not even joking with you right now. Get it loaded up with everything they offer, with a good ol' slathering of their xxx hot sauce, grab a seat, and prepare to be in heaven. 
Need a little bit more? Have them add steak or chicken to the wrap at no extra cost (the price they charge will the the higher of the two individuals). 

Burrito Boys is a small, dive-y looking place, but it packs some wonderful people, a great atmosphere, and some seriously tasty flavours. 
Try it sober, try it drunk, try it high. It doesn't matter... All I know is - you'll leave with a full wallet, and one hell of a full stomach.
