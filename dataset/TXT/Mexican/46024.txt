7Q2cYSl5NBYytJzgjX0oKw Been here three times. One total epic fail and two mediocre. Took forever to get served even on the good visits. Mac n cheese app is tasty. Groups of four each time and different entrees around. Nobody had anything to rave about. 
The good news is also the bad news. It is open air and outside. So you enjoy fresh air. Unless they are smoking at the next table. Somehow I get the impression that the clientele here had a higher proportion of smokers. It certainly took away from our enjoyment.
