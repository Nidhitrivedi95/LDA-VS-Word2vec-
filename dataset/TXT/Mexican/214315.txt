QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA On paper this is a grand concept, especially to someone like myself that loves nachos so much. This one is in an odd location just off the strip, but is worth finding if you want some nachos while watching some sports. There is a lot of indoor seating and some outdoor as well. They have a lot of televisions through out.

We started with an order of the Queso Dip. It is a good sized portion and was a nice way to start the meal. In hind sight we likely did not need an appetizer but we were happy with it none the less. For the meal we ordered the Nacho Average Burger Nacho. I liked the idea of going a little off the grid for my selection. All the normal parts of a burger, less the bun, on a bed of chips. It was interesting, but tasty. I enjoyed it. The portion was massive. You can easily share them with multiple friends.

This is a good casual spot to load up on bar food and watch the game. It is pretty affordable too.
