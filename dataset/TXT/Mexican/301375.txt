My normal dish is the four rolled taco special and I just LOVE it! Take your taquito, dip it in the beans, dip it in the rice, dunk it into your salsa of choice and, YUM. I've also had their super nachos, super fries, breakfast burritos, and horchata. All lovely and tasty, and I've never had a bad experience. Try them!
