I felt invisible and literally had to ask for everything. Both bartenders had an attitude and the lady who appeared to be a manager looked as miserable as anyone I've seen. I would have liked another margarita, but I felt asking for one was going to take an act of congress. Shame on you Yolos for ruining my decision to stop in. And just in case anyone thinks this is just a disgruntled ex-employee, rest assured, I am not. I try to eat at different places in my travels, and this was truly disappointing.
