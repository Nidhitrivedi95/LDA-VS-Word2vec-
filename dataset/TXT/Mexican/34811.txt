5-fpVbhoZcuSWatzof5YIg I used to love this restaurant. Then I had a few very bad fish tacos about a year ago, so I stopped going. Decided to give them one more try tonight. The restaurant was completely empty when I walked in at about 5:45 PM. A couple more people arrived while I was there.

I had a fish taco, which wasn't bad at all. Also ordered a steak taco. It was inedible.

Several tables were dirty. The trash can was full. The employees appeared to have nothing to do, so there was no excuse for the poor condition of the place.

Sorry, Rubio's. I loved you, but I won't be back. It's not me, it's you.
