Kx0MUrNQ737s-VVElk6Vig I came across this place while I was looking for a place to have breakfast, the place is small and clean. I give this place a 5 star because the food here is so delicious and the service is well, the price here is not expensive as many places. I suggest if ur in town and want to eat Mexican food this is the place to come and eat.
