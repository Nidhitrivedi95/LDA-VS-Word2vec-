_XN-GwzZwAyIqLKJsl2htg My new favorite restaurant! I'm so sad that I'm only in town for the week. We had a bit of everything, but the Miso glazed Chilean sea bass, the Suzuki roll, and the tres leches cake were our favorites. Great ambiance and the service was fantastic and the food came out very fast.
