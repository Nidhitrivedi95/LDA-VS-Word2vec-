oxICG1HQrL0lTvJEZ3zXcw I normally enjoy this spot but today they had a server there her name was Stephanie, I've been going to the jones location for over 6yrs, sometimes 3 times a week the other servers and cooks knew us so well they would say the usual plates for all of you. Today was different Stephanie was training someone new and I have never seen either one of them there. We ordered, our food came out, I asked for a refill on our chips cause we always do, now she said we don't give refills on chips I stated that  we had been coming there for yrs and they have always. She said no we don't but had some attitude. Now her tone and lack of customer service left much to be desired. When we asked for the owners info for us to contact she stated that the owner doesn't speak English and she could call for me. I didn't believe that someone who owners 4 stores can't understand English. They lost customer for .38 cent food cost and a server to young to know better. Food establishments please train your staff and teach them how to talk to customers.
