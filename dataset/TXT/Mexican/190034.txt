OD09pm-MzynigAvD5KoGPA My favorite burrito that I've ever had. This place may feel like a hole in the wall but it has plenty of regulars who all love it the same. They recently changed their name from sombrero's to mucha lucha and I love all the changes they've made. For a tiny taco shop it feels warm and authentic.

The food is greasy and beyond delicious. The salsa bar is nice and I particularly enjoy their avocado based sauce. My personal favorite meat is their barbacoa but it's all good.

If you're looking for a top-notch burrito, give this place a try.
