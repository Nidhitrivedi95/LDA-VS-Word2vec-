jdaqp6fW0TqP2TdHatB7Pw Honestly, if you EVER want to run a successful restaurant let alone a successful business, you need good customer service, and you definitely want your customers to feel welcomed to this fabulous location. Yet both are extremely unsatisfactory. Also this place likes to open whenever the owner feels like it. Half the time it's closed in the middle of the day. I've ate here 3 times and the food has always been extremely above average, it's definitely good. All 3 times the guys there just seemed extremely rude and careless about us. It's just sad to see such incompetence from an owner that I'd rather eat shoe leather from someone else then fork over $$ towards someone of his nature.

I don't think I'm harsh either by any means, I've tried it once, tried it twice, and tried it a third time hoping I might of only just caught them on a bad time previously and all 3 times it was like I was talking to grumpy little children. I do not recommend going here.
