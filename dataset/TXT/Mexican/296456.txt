zCmwErM82hdKl4L2UixDJw Does Barrio even need a review? Well, I'll give you one anyway. Barrio is hands down one of my favorite go to spots when I'm craving tacos. My favorite part is that you can create your own. You can get everything you want in your taco and nothing you don't want. One of the things that makes their tacos so great is the stoner shell. It's a hard shell surrounded by chorizo queso and then a soft shell. I can't eat my tacos without it. They also have a vegetarian version! If you're not feeling very creative or want to choose a taco that's already put together, they have a menu to choose from. They also have great margaritas and a nice beer selection. This place can get super crowded (like hour wait for tacos crowded) so I would suggest going at a less traditional time. If you're looking for brunch, they have that too! Not only can you get amazing tacos, when I was there they also had this French toast bowl that was to die for. Barrio will never let you down!
