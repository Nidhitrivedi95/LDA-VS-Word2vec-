vNwj8u1KbnKPQFMTd3TDWw Food was not bad and the prices were comparable. However  some of the staff is not caring or courteous. Our waiter was a complete ass to my bfs daughter. Rolling his eyes and exuding hatred for his job when taking her order. We were in a hurry and left the table after 10+ minutes of waiting for the check. We stood at the hostess stand waiting for her to bring him back. He did not realize we were standing there when he looked with disgust at our table and then rolled his eyes severely annoyed before showing great surprise when he looked up at my bf standing in front of him. He was a dick!

Besides him, good times
