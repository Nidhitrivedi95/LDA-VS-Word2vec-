ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA Love the new summer menu!  We've been to Ocotillo every which way: brunch, lunch, dinner and bar, so we know our way around the menus.  Last night, a Saturday, we tried some of the new dishes.  The Persian cucumbers with miso and peppers was crunchy with a great combination of cool and spicy flavors.  Next up was our favorite: sliced & grilled summer squash with squash blossoms, pesto, some yummy breadcrumbs and a sauce that brought the whole thing together.  FIsh loving Hubby had the fresh halibut special with Israeli couscous, and he gave it 5 stars.  I had the housemade cavarecce pasta with a lusciously spicy sauce and surprise: a few bites of sweet crunch  - carrots I think?  We still had room for the Almond Joy to share: 2 scoops each of coconut & chocolate sorbet wi toasted almonds, perfect on a hot summer evening. David the sommelier came up with a Spanish white wine that paired perfectly with the halibut, I had the Sazerac with my pasta, great cocktail from their mixologist.  
There are new salads that I can't wait to try on a lunch visit, small gems lettuce & buttermilk dressing and a fresh carrot offering were two. 
New season, new experiences at a favorite spot.
