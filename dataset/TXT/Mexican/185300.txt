nUfeYJ_YEaDzggPKnYry3g Tia Rosa's "happy hour" menu Antojitos selections were flavorful and priced to please...  Smoked pork on Nachcos awesome.  Shrimp presentation and BBQ tasty.  However, order 1st and 2nd drinls when you walk in.  Server, was very seasoned and handling multiple tables well.  Come back for "happy hour" !
