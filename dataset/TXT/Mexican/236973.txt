SW6ZQk22G1_CV81_gfnvNQ What a gem!  I'm a bit of a Mexican, Southwestern food snob and was a bit skeptical but now it's the place to satisfy my cravings.  The flavours are traditional with a modern twist and excellent preparation.  There were great cocktails with a very comfy atmosphere. The real shocker was the desert menu.....a perfect combination of classic flavours with creativity.  Loved this spot and will return with more friends soon!
