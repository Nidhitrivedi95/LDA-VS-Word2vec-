5KdyfLCaKi99zLIr3BdIZw Oh my.   Please close this place.  Went there for .99 cent margaritas.  Left with food poisoning.  Remember the scene from bridesmaids?...
The place is a mess...it looks just like the old bar Hobnobbers.  Can see right into the kitchen (mistake to look).  Margaritas were all mix.  I had the #32 chicken and beef burrito.  It was sitting in a pool of some sort of fluid.  I ate some rice and picked thruough the burrito...
Waiter was busy...service was slow, food was awful.  

Then came 0130 hrs.....
I had barf in my mouth...and explosive diahrreah.

For the love of pete...listen to me.  Avoid like the plague.
