oCwJdiYhZS8VM5_LgmQP0g Should be called "New Mexican Food" rather than Mexican food. The option were limited. Not quite the traditional Mexican food I was hoping for. Very Americanized. Too salty. 

I only saw white people staffing the restaurant. Not a Spanish speaker in sight. So if you're looking for authentic, keep cruising; this isn't your place. If you're looking for a decent atmosphere and you aren't terribly concerned about the food; this will do just fine.
