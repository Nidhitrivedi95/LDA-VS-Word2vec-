gGt00WW8sNY2Sop7jYa7Tw Yum! This is not a typical Mexican or taco place. It's more of a California twist. We had the chicken Milanese sandwich and the short rib sandwich. They both were a lot of food and had amazing flavor!  I can't forget to mention the app- we had the queso with chorizo and jalapeños. It was the best queso I've had recently! Their chips are good too. 

The inside is really nice, there are garage doors that roll up, so will be really nice this spring! Great bar set up too. Drinks looked good, but we didn't try any. One note, it is really loud. They could turn the music down a notch. (We are younger with no kids and thought it was loud). 

The only other minus is the parking set up. Very hard to find a spot and the spaces that were open specifically said they were not for Bakersfield parking. Hopefully they can get that worked out!
We will definitely be back!!
