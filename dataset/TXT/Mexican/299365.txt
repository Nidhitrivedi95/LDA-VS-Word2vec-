ZkUWOdBA4T7pdUhT0dkRzQ Our food was room temperature and flavorless. Our poor kid was served tacos that had obviously sat under a heat lamp so it was completely dried out and the tortillas had turned hard. Service was extremely slow and our waiter apologized several times. We saw several tables complaining and we even saw a table walk out due to the bad service/food. I'm bummed since I was really looking forward to eating here.
