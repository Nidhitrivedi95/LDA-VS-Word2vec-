HkbNItNrnXlNo59M0YyoMg If your craving some tacos or a burrito in Tempe, this is your place.   I started going because is convenient to my job for luncheons.   It's a little pricey, but I have found myself addicted to the AZ burrito and the protein bowl.  Food is delicious and service is always outstanding.  Waiter and bartenders ensure you feel welcome and check on you and ask now the food tastes.  It's nice to feel welcome in a place that serves fantastic food.  Loco patron has absolutely earned my business and loyalty.
