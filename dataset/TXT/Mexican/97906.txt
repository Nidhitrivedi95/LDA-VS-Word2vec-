ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA So good! I have rarely been able to give a 5-star rating, but this place earned it! Really cool layout with a courtyard area. The food was amazing! Our table ordered the fried zucchini, with & without peppers, pork sandwich, chicken dumplings, curry soup, roasted cauliflower & chili. Everything was fantastic-not one complaint. Then we ended the meal with the Girl Scout cookie pudding truffle. Can't wait to go back and try more. The only warning I can give is it's extremely loud inside at the tables. We couldn't hear each at our table. You might want to try the patio or bar area.
