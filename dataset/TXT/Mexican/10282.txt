_XN-GwzZwAyIqLKJsl2htg Beautiful restaurant! When my husband first mentioned that this restaurant was a mix of Japanese and Mexican, I was like what? a Japanese/mexican fusion restaurant blended together...lol! Interesting mix but, never heard of it!
But, I'm glad we went. I love the decor, love the atmosphere, the sushi selection was yummy, and their ramen was good...Nice place
