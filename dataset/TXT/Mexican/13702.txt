0QBFtNNj9RIggZGeivcbEg I've enjoyed Plaza Bonita the few times I've been there.  It hasn't knocked my socks off, but it is pretty good Sonoran Mexican food.  The atmosphere is nice.  The service is good, and the restaurant is clean.  They would score more points with me if they made their own chips and/or tortillas, but all in all a good place to eat.
