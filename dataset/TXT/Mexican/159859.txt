kwLlQn95rqiqvmM4Yc2hIg I ordered from Roberto's Taco shop after passing it several time on my way home. The place always looks busy and it's open 24 hours.

Pros: I revived a huge chicken chimichanga combination plate with beans and rice for 8 dollars and some change. The portions are huge and you are for sure to have some left over.

Cons: the chicken was bland and the food did not deliver. I have had better chimichangas and for a lower price. The customer service is also good.

I would not recommend wasting your money at Roberto's Taco shop. I literary throw away my food after a few bites.

Just a huge disappointment
