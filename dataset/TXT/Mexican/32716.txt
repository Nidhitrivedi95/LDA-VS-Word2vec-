4OUGSeQeASZGn9nSb8Ialg In Henderson for a lacrosse tournament and found this place on the yelp. Great chilli relleno.  Little ways out of the way but food was fantastic, service was excellent.  Save room for fried ice cream.  Ok 5 stars. Fun little resort village, I'm sure we'll come back when we're back for another tourny.
