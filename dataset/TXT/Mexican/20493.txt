24MgaUT4TWO3_kZQlBu8sw The McDonalds of the burrito world is in the hood and all is good.  

Excellently prepared meats, salsas, beans, and salads all combine for a winning experience.  The staff at this location is well equipped for success, the line always moves quickly and they actually smile when taking your payment.  

My go-to lately has been the salad with no lettuce. What?  Veggies, both pinto and black beans, all of the salsa (heavy on the corn-not to be confused with crack, or cracked corn).  It's a filling meal topped with carnitas, so good!

They have a small outside seating area along a fairly busy entrance to Desert Ridge/Target.  Probably best to not eat outside with small children but if you've been sidewalk trained, you're probably ok. Lots of shade at lunch time too!

Lots of options in this area but Chipotle is always a treat and its a quick meal on a busy day in North Phoenix.
