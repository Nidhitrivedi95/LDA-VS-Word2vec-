as_fyujgsdwtV56n31z-Sw My husband, 18 month old daughter & I came for dinner tonight at 5:30. We sat outside. The food was great. We made our own guac which came with plantain chips. For dinner my husband got the ceviche, the chicken rice bowl, and I got three tacos. We ended the meal with the caramel flan which was so yummy. Everything was delicious. I will 100% come back. The only flaw for me was that the tacos were dripping with the sauce, so a little less sauce would be perfection.
