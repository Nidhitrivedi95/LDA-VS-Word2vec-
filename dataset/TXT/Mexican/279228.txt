Xs37o78aby0o-Wmvh5yYPg We had a pleasant first visit here this Friday evening. We were immediately welcomed as we walked into the patio by a very friendly gentleman. He sat us at the corner table by the window with a nice view of the patio for people watching. Our waitress was very friendly (Lyndsey, I think). She provided quick and very welcoming service throughout our visit. The food was ok. We had the salsa and queso appetizer. The queso had a film on top, as if it had been sitting for a while. The salsa seemed fresh and had a kick to it, which we liked! I had the wet burrito which was pretty good. My husband had steak tacos which he really enjoyed. I had a cucumber margarita....this was the best part of my dinner. So good-fresh, light and very refreshing. I'll definitely be back.
