R5WkKWo9ae2gN2feWtB_4g They have a cantina/bar. If you go to there and order a beer or two without having a meal the manager doesnt look at it favorable. He makes you feel uncomfortable. I guess thats why the bar in the cantina is always empty when i arrive. Why have a bar in the restaurant if its discouraged to have a beer or two?
