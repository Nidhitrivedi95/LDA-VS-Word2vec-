G6BwYw_0_atLPTzI1uokIA The food was really good but on the check they charged me twice three dollars for beans. Also the bartender was very slow we are already had our meals before we had any drinks. We weren't in a hurry otherwise this would be a problem. It was Cinco de Mayo so I understand that it might be extra busy but we went early and there was only three or four other tables eating. There was a charity event going on outside and mariachis inside. Overall I would come back I just wouldn't order the nachos next time. Maybe no drinks either because my friend asked for an Irish mule and got vodka and Jamison w/ no lime. Lol
