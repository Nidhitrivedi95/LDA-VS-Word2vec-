ssZx3Jzhme38YTbLzaDY6Q located just around the corner from ASU, mamacita's is the perfect place to grab some cheap beer and cheap eats whether or not you're there to wind down after class or visting in town for the weekend (take a guess why i went...)

came here with the boy and had $2 corona's which is the weekend special. sit at the bar and if you're lucky enough to catch the beer cap that gets hit into the air by the bartenders then a corona is on the house... definitely a funner game the more beers you have in your system, trust me!!

this bar is strictly outdoors and perfect for arizona weather!! stop by when you're in the area and have a $2 corona for me :)
