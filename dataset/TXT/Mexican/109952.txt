fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg My family and I went in about a week ago for my sisters birthday. The line to get in was short but it took about 20 mins to get in. When we were seated they had a lot of empty tables. So either they were understaffed or they thought by making a line they would look popular. My sister and I both ordered drinks and the nachos to share. The drinks were not great. She hated hers and ordered another and I finished my 1 and changed to water. The nachos were cool looking but not that great either. Very dry and the nacho cheese didn't taste great. Some of the cops were very chewy as well. My mom got the fajitas and enjoyed them. My dad and husband got the taco Tuesday deal. They enjoyed most of the tacos and since they were unlimited for like $30 they got a lot. They both agreed they will return for the tacos but my sister and I both didn't like the drinks or nachos. They also brought her a dessert for her birthday and it wasn't good either.  I personally will most likely never go back. I didn't feel like the food was worth the price. There are a lot of other restaurants on the strip for the same price.
