q7MorRPzU_J-iekeDKUKgw Reposado gave me an exciting night out!  I came here a couple Fridays ago and enjoyed some of their delicious margaritas.  It was pretty busy, so we didn't get to enjoy the patio, but it looked great when we walked around.  Instead, we found a table inside, which wasn't all that comfortable.  Tables were sticky and ventilation left something too be desired.  The kicker for me was when the bouncer instigated a fight with one of the patrons.  

What's the lesson?  Come for the drinks, get onto the patio and beware of the bouncers
