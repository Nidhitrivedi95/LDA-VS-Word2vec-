jKndHanZV4fygbNHWK5Xnw NO STARS..... Food is good...people who work there are rude ass holes. Im sitting in the parking lot eating lunch. as you well know the parling lot is empty. i am sitting  under the shade enjoying lunch. like i said food is good. So some ass hole, im assuming the manager there in a red ford F-150  he parked his truck right in front of mine "blocking me in"...what a prick...thats how you treat customers. Well not this one again. Mexican food is a dime a dozen in Phoenix , ill be sure to put the word out on this ass hole....
