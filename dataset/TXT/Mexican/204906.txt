pup46G8qFBG8695RtbQNwA Have been there many times and enjoyed it but tonight might be the last. We felt as if we where getting ripped off. Ordered the kickass margarita pitcher which is $36 and tasted like just the mix. Discussed this with our server Kyle and he acted as if he didn't know what was going on blaming it on the vendors. Asked if we could get a couple of shots of basic Sauza or Cuervo. Brought 3 out but at end of meal we were charge $12 for each shot!!! Again tried to talk to Kyle and he that that's the cheapest shot they have-BS! He should have told us the cost because we would have said no thank you. Asked for Cheryl the owner and he said they had no management on site and there was nothing he could do. Food was fairly decent but not as good as previously. Side of sour cream came as we were finishing. Overall they have lost good customers that rave and bring all of our out of town guests unless this problem is addressed.
