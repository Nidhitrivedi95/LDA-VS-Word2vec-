bAWQmZgMggH4HTJnVcpLPw When i travel to Caltexico, I go by way of Moe's.  Because although Chipotle and Qdoba do a fine fast food burrito, they don't do it as well as Moe's.  

And it is fast food, but it pains me to categorize it in that fashion, because when I say fast food, you're thinking Taco Bell. . . and it's not THAT.  It's a step up.  The comparison is perhaps equivalent to a Red Robin to Wendy's sort of thing.  Red Robin is to Wendy's what Moe's is to Taco Bell.  

It's fast (though if you go at noon for a lunch hour meal, you'll question ANY categorization of their food involving the adjective "fast"), but good.

I go with the Joey Bag o' Donuts burrito combo with steak and black beans.  Yum.  I'm full now.
