QYuojrlW94mpEwnp0uUIWA Great local burger joint!!! I got the Bulgogi burger and my bf got the A1 burger. They were both delicious!!! No complaints. 

And the fries were so addicting!!! Perfect texture and perfect size! 

We were giving complementary chips and salsa while waiting for our food and was offered Thrifty ice cream after we were done with our meal. 

Will definitely come back again!
