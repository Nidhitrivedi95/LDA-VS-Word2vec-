TRRmgX8mySv_y-DOkTZTFQ We enjoyed a wonderful Saturday afternoon lunch. A small place with a great atmosphere. The menu was full of authentic Mexican and Tex-Mex style choices with a great list of sides to pick from...Elote, Lime Potatoes, black beans, rice. The portions are generous and we were stuffed at the end. They also have great options for kids who will stray from the basics of chicken and fries (but they have that too). Would definitely visit again.
