3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ My fiance & I tried this restaurant on a Friday night. It's inside an old church & is absolutely beautiful as you step inside the building. 
The environment was fun & upbeat, they even had a live DJ to keep the good vibes going through the dinner. 
My fiance ordered 3 taco varieties & I had 2 different tacos, all of which were phenomenal! This is a must try restaurant, you won't leave disappointed!
