XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg I was more than excited about our reservations at Mesa Grill and the excitement turned out to be well worth it. From the drinks to the appetizers to the main courses- everything was delicious and impressive. The goat cheese fundido appetizer was to.die.for and the chilaquiles (that I ordered as my main course) were some of the best Ive ever had (and I like to think of myself as a chilaquiles connoisseur; its one of my favorite brunch items and Ive had them all over California, in Chicago, Austin, and now Las Vegas).

Im not really one to drink margaritas (they're much too sweet and they typically contain crappy ingredients), but Mesa Grill's "skinny" margarita (the Partida Margarita) was delicious and, thankfully, not overly sweet since in was only sweetened with agave nectar instead of simple syrup or plain sugar or other questionable sweeteners. 

Overall: I would highly recommend dining at Mesa Grill if you have the chance. Great service, wonderful food, impressive margaritas, and conveniently located at Caesar's Palace.
