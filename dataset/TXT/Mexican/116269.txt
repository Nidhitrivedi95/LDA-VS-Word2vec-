GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog My family is a big fan of Jose Andres.  I had tried China Poblano on a previous visit to Vegas about 5 years ago and while pleasant, was not wowed by the experience.  I almost didn't come on this visit but was tempted by the Social Hour (happy hour).  I was catching the late night red eye back home so I had plenty of time to kill after my conference ended.  I had the Instead of a Phone Call cocktail as I did not like the ones offered for Social Hour.  It was a good choice.  I had the Sticky Wings and Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich.  Then, the ladies working in front of me started making fresh tortillas so I knew I needed to have some of that goodness and added a quesadilla.  There was another gentleman also taking advantage of the Social Hour and ordered similar to me.  I wish I asked him how the fried wontons were.  As it was, I was just glad I came to the realization that I was going to be at the airport for hours and packed up all the leftovers for another meal later.  It was just as good later as when first served.  But, I had to stop.  My plan was to hit up Jaleo before leaving and I had to leave a little room : )  Yummy!
