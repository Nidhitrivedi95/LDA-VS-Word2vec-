fqMAnoS2sTokz6lqBSmoCw Pros: great drinks, very awesome design and concept, good service

Cons: food was awful, tacos cold, shrimp and fish were barely visible and also tasteless, guac was very smooth

Really hope they turn it around because it has the potential to be super cool and trendy, but it has a lot to compete with having Babalu down the road and Cabo in NoDa.
