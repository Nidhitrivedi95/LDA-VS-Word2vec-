RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg While working in Vegas on the strip, I asked some locals where I should go to get some good "real" tacos. 3 different guys said Tacos El Gordo. So, I had to try it. I as on the opposite side of the strip, so I called for a ride share. My driver also recommended it, after seeing that I was headed there. So, this place had a lot to look up to. I am happy to say that it did! I was a little taken back when I walked into the building, but quickly figured out how to order food. You figure out what taco meat you want, then goto the area that happens to prepare that meat. After collecting all the tacos you want, you then go to the register and pay. It wasn't that crowded when I went in there at 8pm, but I could see how this structure could move people through the lines at a faster pace than a standard 1 counter set up.
What I really like bout the place, is the selection of meats. I got a cabeza (beef head), lengua (beef tongue), and Tripa (beef guts) Tacos. They were very, very tasty! At $2.25+ a taco, the price is a little high, but being on the strip, it's still a lot lower than most restaurants in the area.
