zCmwErM82hdKl4L2UixDJw Finally, got a chance to eat here, after all the reviews & hype I was pumped for something spectacular. I couldn't have been more disappointed. The tacos were mediocre at best, the service was abysmal, the waitress was ridiculous & could not seem to find out why 4 tacos took over an hour, the drinks were small & over priced. And on top of all that the restaurant  wasn't even full.
