G9-O-eRMtgsw_pfWXVCEfQ Another chain restaurant that gets a better than passing review. 

Taco del Mar is a block from my office--one star
They're always friendly and get my order right--two stars
Today the person behind the counter recommended a great burrito--three stars
They offer a wide variety of average Mexican faire at reasonable prices--four stars

Some people may not agree with me, but Taco del Mar is what it is, fast food. When I choose to eat here it's because it's convenient, not because they offer the best Mexican food in the valley. It fills a need. That's why I give them four stars. If they had crappy food and crappy service it would be another story!

If you're on Camelback at 40th and you're hungry, pull in to Taco del Mar.
