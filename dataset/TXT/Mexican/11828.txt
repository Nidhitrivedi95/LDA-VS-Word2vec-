We then waiting ten more minutes for a server to come talk to us. The food and drinks did come pretty quickly and were pretty good, but definitely overpriced for what we got. We got to wait another ten or so minutes for our server to bring the check and then another ten or so minutes for her to bring the damn thing back so we could sign the credit card slip. No kidding, we were there for almost an hour and a half for two drinks, chips and salsa, and fajitas.
