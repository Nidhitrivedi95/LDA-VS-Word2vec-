TUVtxnT471P1UibiNNnVSg Last time I went there, I did a pickup order. I was overcharged $10 and when I went back to show the older lady the mistake she made, she never apologized and was very, VERY rude. Even after being treated badly, I asked to talk to a manager and she looked at me and said, "I am the manager". It was horrible. Because of her and her attitude, I would never go back. 

It's too bad because the food is decent.
