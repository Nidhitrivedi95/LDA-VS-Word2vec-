jSmVW-fLYgy6TA--N3B4Rw Panchero's has great fresh tasting tortillas and the staff was friendly. Sadly, that was all that impressed me on my last visit. Those coming to dine with children should know that Panchero's does not have an official kids menu or meal and they do not sell milk. Seems very odd to me as it gives the restaurant a non kid friendly feel and seems that from a business perspective causes them to lose customers. The soda machines are dirty and lack any kind of selection, especially diet sodas. There is a decent outside seating area, however, it is littered with cigarette butts which make for an unappetizing experience. As we were eating our meals outside a small child sitting at the table next to us picked a cigarette butt up from the ground much to her parents and our dismay. But who could blame her when they are scattered everywhere? I think this place could implement major improvements by cleaning up the restaurant, adding a kids menu or at a minimum selling milk and maybe offering some fresh topping choices such as limes.
