Wtf! she could of solved this asap and let our group inside and spend money in the business  but instead she just didn't want to deal with it, at the time this was going on more  people got deny to go Inside as well, one of them got deny entry for an ID been expired a few days, I guess they don't want to bring business to the place,  will never come back we would spend our money somewere else.
