veXxt8rGY_RJPpA5QkHT9Q My friends and I checked in during its second week of operation.  It was very busy at 9 PM.  We got a table for six quicker than I had thought.  It was slow to get our orders; but it was understandable as our server Jay was friendly and patient.  Myself and two of my friends are blind and he read us the menu; your web site is not totally accessable for our screen readers.  Chips and salsa of different varietieis are plentiful at our table and it was comfy.  I don't care for bar stools, but that was our only option for seats last night.  We got several different tacos; I ordered a la carte with the white widow soft taco filled with shrimp on one, mahi mahi on the second and chicken on the third.  I also got a side of Carolina reaper sauce.  They diluded the sauce to my surprise and I was not happy; I love spicy food and wanted to feel the pain of the hottest pepper sauce in the world!  Either way, Barrio's new location in Cleveland Heights will be our group's first or second restaurant choice after our Bible study lets out on Thursdays.  Ya'll are wonderful.  I also forgot about the excellent and crazy amount of margarita selections and full bar that was quite decent.
