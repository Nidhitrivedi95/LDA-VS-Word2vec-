v0FdDAXvEYieRWcngbCe1Q Food is just okay. Rubios and Chipotle are so much better. The food line is a mess, no one seems to wipe down the food line and loose food is everywhere. The dining area wasn't being maintained, dirty tables and overflowing trash. The soft drinks line was very wet. Overall the flavor of the food was decent but the poor sanitation is an issue for me. Maybe they were short that one employee who was responsible for cleanup tonight but maybe not.
