I had never heard of it until my sister took me here the other day for breakfast. I ordered the French toast combo it came with eggs and  choice of sausage or bacon and a drink. We both got the same combo we had a buy 1 get 1 free coupon so our meal came to around $11 .

The food was AMAZING so delicious and very big portions!

You can do the drive thru or dine inside we ate inside, the service was great very friendly staff and are on top of everything. I would deffantly eat here again next time i wanna try there cheeseburgers i heard there rea good.

Anyone who hasn't been must go :)
