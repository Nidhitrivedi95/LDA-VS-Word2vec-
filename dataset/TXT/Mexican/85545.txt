DaVTuhzi6EgWStb2eAjNjA So so so good. Fresh ingredients with lots of fresh cotija cheese. We ordered Enchiladas with red sauce and an array of tacos. Red sauce was really flavorful and they had Tacos for every flavor pallet (shrimp, carne asada, chicken, al pastor, chorizo, chicharrones, pork- each with different topping combinations) Also, chips are hot and made-to-order. Wish we would have gone during dinner/HH to try a marg!
