ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA AMAZING! Visited for the first time a few days ago with a friend and the setting was very cool, modern and hip. Very busy and loud but I think that adds to the ambience. Everything we ordered was DELICIOUS! started with the meatball appetizer had the pasta with the pork ragu and finished with the chamomile panna cotta and I can't wait to go back to get it all again!!! Can't wait to go back when he weather isn't so hot because they have a really great outdoor area! The service was so-so but it won't stop me from coming back and giving it another try!
