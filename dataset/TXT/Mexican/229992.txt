SFfPGiq4B0TtpWkLhdCpjA I was visiting my friend on Sunday evening in the area and we decided to stop in and grab some food because I love burritos so much I got the regular size crispy chicken burrito "what a disappointment!" The chicken was dry and taste similar to no name brand chicken pieces from No frills I also got the nacho chips with salsa which was freshly fried it was good and I got a large portion. My friend got the supreme fries she said it was ok. Large portions are offered for what you pay. All the ingredients looked fresh. Taste wise I wasn't impressed.
