New Mexico themed. As a group of friends, we ended up ordering just about one of everything on the menu. Everyone liked their food! I was expecting just a single tamale or enchilada, etc but they also came with rice and beans so it was more food than we expected, considering we just wanted a little snack. 

The dessert was like something brought down to me from heaven. Lavender-infused panna cotta with blackberries and a piñon (pine nut) brittle. OMGGG. I will be going back again and again just to get that! It paired perfectly with the piñon coffee, which is just regular coffee roasted with pine nuts so it has a smooth, nutty taste. 

The worker happily described some of the different menu items to us and even checked on us after words to see if we liked it. Really sweet of him!
