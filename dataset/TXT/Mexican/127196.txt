HWl2EbZhkhAkFgqt44yUkA I bought a Groupon for the yard drinks before our trip. We came in to redeem them and ended up having a great time. The drinks were delicious if you're into frozen sweet alcoholic things like me! They had a balloon artist going to each table making crazy hats, as you can see, and it made for great conversations. I loved it! Of course a little pricey and touristy but it's Vegas!
