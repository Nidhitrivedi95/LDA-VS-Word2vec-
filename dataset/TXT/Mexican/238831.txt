T-KniGykrZ46ZC9plOTspw I got a chorizo breakfast burrito which was REALLY good. The meat tasted fresh and not dry like some chorizo. The salsa was so good and the chips were exactly what you want from homemade chips. The staff was super friendly, they knew the menu and the product very well, they could tell us where the meat came from. I love that the restaurant is family owned, and you can tell from the quality of the meal and the care of the restaurant. It was clean and nicely decorated. And we saw at least 3 regular customers come in and were greeted by the staff like friends.
