uYoSb2rNi77LMQZ-Nn1Epg We found this place by accident but are very happy we did! Everything was excellent from the authentic food, to the drinks, to the service. Our waiter was very accommodating, made great suggestions and even brought out an authentic herb for us to try. Very reasonably priced as well. Has an adorable shaded patio you can dine on. We will definitely be back!
