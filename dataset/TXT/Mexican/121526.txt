h84tU6REsM1VzyUCP0Ss7Q Went to eat at this location on November 13, 2016.  Arrived at 7:15pm and was told that they were closed because they ran out of chicken and steak.  Very disappointing! Don't really believe their excuse for closing so early.  I think the manager on duty was trying to cut some labor hours and close the place early because the restaurant was clearly dead.  Ended up driving to another Baja Fresh.
