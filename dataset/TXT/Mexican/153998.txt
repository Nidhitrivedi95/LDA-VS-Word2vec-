K-uQkfSUTwu5LIwPB4b_vg Great Valentine dinner! Loved our sweet server Lexi who completely knew the extensive menu!! Duck empanadas were good- sweet, cheesy & not spicy. I love guacamole & don't usually order table side because I make my own at home all the time but we did order it and it was hands down the best I have ever had!! We had the guacamole guy add a hint of the ghost sauce & it was out of this world!! Chorizo pork was a good meat dish beautifully plated with a flaming sprig of rosemary. 
Margaritas were good and flavors were well balanced & described with perfection but pricey. Their wines selections are nice reserves. Unique ones including selections from Darioush. 

Beautiful atmosphere! Love the salt block wall back lit by kitchen, nice effect. The only disappointment is the very high price. It WAS nice and a lovely evening. But prices were very steep.
We will go back again someday & enjoy another night at the Mission. But not a regular stop at $200 a pop!
