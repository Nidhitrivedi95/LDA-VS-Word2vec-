DyOzNIeXUksPNLXYHnB-oQ Sabor might be my favorite take out spot, next to its sister, Tres Amigos. My trick is simply order online! Like tonight for instance, I knew I'd be hungry in 20 mins so I ordered, hit HT for a powerball ticket and some half and half and apples and boom....text received that my order was ready. Don't forget, free chips with Yelp check in. You can bypass the main line if you've already paid online too. The staff is always attentive even if it's chaos in there. It gets super busy every night, really. They have specials daily and don't forget the free salsa bar towards the back.
