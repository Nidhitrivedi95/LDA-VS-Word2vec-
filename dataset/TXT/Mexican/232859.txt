spvjNOYeR7sFX6yTgP21og First we had some trouble getting in. The front door was locked and the side door said CLOSED even though it was 5pm. Took them a longish time to let us in even though we saw them moving around in the back. Not good for casual business...

We had a large table reserved for a party. The decor was worth some discussion - we liked the crazy striped table cloths and it was overall a dark but kind of amusing atmosphere. They set the table with tortilla chips and salsa which was nice but kind of bland-like.

So after the longish wait for drinks we ordered food; I got the steak quesadilla and my boyfriend, as well as two other guests, got Fajitas.
So EVENTUALLY the food comes, and mine is.. okay, the meat is decent excepting the one piece of forgiveable cartilage, but HERE IS MY PROBLEM which resulted in two stars:

 The three fajitas came but with only two servings of tortillas and condiments. The explanation was that it was like that for "space issues" when there was clearly room for three helpings. But they were hungry and ate anyway, and of course they ran out of tortillas with lots of food left.
Now when each customer has paid $15/each for their food and only two people's amount came, why is it a bother to the waitress when you ask now for the third amount of tortillas? The waitress was all snippy and wanted to know how many because they would have to charge us.

This was stupid. And the wait for the food was too long on an empty house. I won't be going back.. we have plenty of other better choices for mexican eats in Toronto.
