Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ When there on Sunday nite with my wife to have late dinner. I have been here before food is ok service was good but this time service was terrible , we sat there for 20 min no one showed up I got up and asked one of the girls in front for help and that didn't help, finally a waiter showed up to say hello and left as fast as he showed up. I say if they were busy Ok but they weren't. That's the last time I'm going to go there and would not recommended anybody to go there.
