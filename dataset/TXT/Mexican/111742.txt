G1lB2bUf1MT1FZT8TBy62g Great peeps!  Good 'ole mexicana grub. It's on the way to Lake Mead entoute to a day of boating and drinking - go figure, it's on Lake Mead Road. Tap it again on the way home. #4 is a trusty item!  Chips with awesome salsa, pickled carrots/onions/peppers. In short, great beer food!
