HpK1ILGUm5W129toiRSsXw BEST chicken taco ever.

Cheese quesadillas are a whole meal. Amazing.

BUT...whenever I want a breakfast burrito when they open, they are NOT OPEN. This is really early in the morning, but if you post the time you open, you should be open and ready to go, right?

Have left without breakfast a number of times due to this.

Carne asada / carnitas anything is to die for. Cheap and yummy.
