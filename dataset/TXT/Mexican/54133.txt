9qqdaSdeMV8tY4LBMZXvhg If you are looking for an inexpensive restaurant in Lorain this is a great place to go. While their food isn't anything spectacular, it definitely isn't bad either. I have yet to have a bad meal at El Arriero. I don't care how busy they are the food always comes out very quickly. Portions sizes are HUGE! They also have great Margaritas. 

The restaurant is located in a huge old medieval looking castle which is situated just a few feet from the banks of Lake Erie. The best time to eat dinner here is in the late spring through the early fall. Take in a gorgeous sunset while sipping margaritas and eating Mexican on their outdoor patio. 

El Arriero can get busy on the weekends, but I have never had to wait for a table. 

Give them a call...they often have Mexican Mariachi bands...especially around dinnertime in the summer.


I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!!! Give them a shot!!!
