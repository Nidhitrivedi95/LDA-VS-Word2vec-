YtUaJkgKc1pucwdSq_DQeQ Classic old school hole in the wall mexican food.

This place is an Arcadia staple and has fantastic mex. This is not for dieting. Eat the chips, eat the cheese crisps, eat the speciality plates. Everything here is good. 

Great place to grab a beer, eat some chips and salsa, and watch a game with friends.
