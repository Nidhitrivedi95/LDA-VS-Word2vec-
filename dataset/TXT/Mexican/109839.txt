fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg Service was great.  Food... not so good.  Got the chorizo loco burger.  Had also sorta of hot stuff on it, was expecting a forehead sweating experience.  Took a bite, no heat.  Second third????  I don't know if they just too much of the other stuff on it, was made wrong, or just bad recipe.  Fries were just loaded with a seasoning salt.  Too much to eat very many.  Beer was cold.  Waitress friendly and we got all of our orders promptly.  Skip this place and look elsewhere.
