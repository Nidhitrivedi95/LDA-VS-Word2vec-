jScBTQtdAt-8RshaiBEHgw Thank God for Yelp or we never would have found this place.  It's in an office complex you wouldn't see from the street. 

Very unique and eclectic menu with an Asian flare. They have a few different types of eggs benedict. We had the soft shell crab benedict. I don't usually don't go for hollandaise sauce but theirs is light and tasty.  They have also have a huge lunch menu which I'm anxious to try the next time we come back. 

Service was impeccable and personal and the chef checks in with every table.  Can't wait to return.
