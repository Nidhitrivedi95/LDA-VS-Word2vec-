MAuSh7NKoT__CQ4BumoayA Usually i dont like american versions of mexican food but oh lordie it was delicous i would describe it as gourmet mexican food, fancy ingredients to give it a delicious and unique taste to the food. I wasnt so crazy on the rice and beans but everything else was amazing. Drinks were good, hostess kind of snobby but everybody else inside was great very attentive. I will be going back, im still dreaming but the shrimp quesadilla.
