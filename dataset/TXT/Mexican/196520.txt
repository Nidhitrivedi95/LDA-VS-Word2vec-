oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ The guacamole with, of all things, pomegranate seeds, was very good.  Service was great.

We had the two for one margaritas.  THey were good for happy hour but I wouldn't want to pay full price for them

We got one other margarita that had grand mariner added.  It was super sour.  I knew there was something wrong  with it, but others thought that's just the way it was supposed to be.

Then about ten minutes later, our waiter said,the bartender accidentally made two of your drink with grand mariner, want another one for free?   Sure!

The second one, was waaaaaay better, proving the first drink was made wrong.  So trust your instinct and return that nasty tasting margarita.

We went to see Donny and Marie at the tropicanna  after we left here, and donny was great.  He came to our table and slapped us five.
