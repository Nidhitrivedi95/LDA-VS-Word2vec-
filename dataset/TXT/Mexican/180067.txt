n_UlhRNcv9dm04NbUNBrFQ I gotta hand it to them on creativity. The burritos are sort of "around the world" themed AND they have a small size, which is nice. I couldn't resist trying the Tikka with chicken, which sounded great, but the execution was a little lackluster. I thought the tikka masala sauce would be rich and tomatoey and spicy but it was too mild. :/ The burrito also had cilantro lime rice, chickpeas (which I liked a lot), cucumbers (a nice crunch) and a yogurt sauce. Perhaps the yogurt sauce neutralized the other sauce too much. Either way, a burrito called Tikka needs to be spicy and spicy, it was not. I would be open to trying a different one if I should find myself at one of these again, but I won't be expecting a world of flavor.
