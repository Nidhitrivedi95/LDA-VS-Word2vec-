IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA Been going to the one at Mandalay for years, and finally decided to hit the one at Caesars. +1000 on Opentable for most reservation slots, if you're into that. 

Depending on where you are coming from, the place is a bit of a pain to get to. If you're coming from a different casino, walk down the strip to the Forum Shops entrance and skip the trek through the inside of Caesars. 

Service is great. The decor is very nice, but not over the top. You definitely feel welcomed and conformable here. 

The menu is a little small compared to most Mexican places and it's a little different than the usual "taco and burrito" Mexican restaurant. That being said, I've come here with many people, and everyone found something on the menu that they loved. Oh - the enchiladas (all of them), are amazing. The oysters were pretty good too, the iced toppings were a pleasant surprise. 

Very reasonably priced for the location.
