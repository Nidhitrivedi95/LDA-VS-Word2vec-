Db3CfZWrtG33UZSs8Tdlsg So I've made a couple more visits and have discovered their pico de gallo...  OMG!  It's what pico de gallo should be!  Fresh, tasty diced tomatoes and onions with cilantro.  It might have some additional spices in there - I'm really not sure because we eat it so quickly that nobody has a chance to really inspect it - LOL!!  This stuff is so good that I've started having my fella swing by on his way home to grab a large Pico and some chips just to munch on as an afternoon snack  :-)  I live close by, I wonder if I could build some sort of funnel device straight into my kitchen?  LOL  Thanks Sabor - Steel Creek!!
