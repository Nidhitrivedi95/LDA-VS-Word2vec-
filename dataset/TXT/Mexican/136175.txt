iOt7ebp4Zy-5YUjHL1rbmQ Not the best...I am sorry to say, I wish it were better. The house Salas's has too much acidic flavor? Lime juice i think? The taco meat was bland had a chicken, carne, Birria and I can honestly say I was not overwhelmed with flavor. In fact the meats were bland. Not even sure how that is possible because the chicken has an amazing orange hue covering every piece implying it was marinated for a very long time and slow cooked to perfection. None the less it was as bland as the shredded beef (birria) I am a huge connoisseur of actual Mexico street tacos...if you want tasty "flavorful" Carne hit up the pork shop in the QC...sorry Backyard Tacos I really wanted to enjoy your tacos more...:(
