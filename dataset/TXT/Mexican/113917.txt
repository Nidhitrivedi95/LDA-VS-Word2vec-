GETVAz5SCk8rFziexV54Aw The restaurant is one of few to serve Mexican breakfast. I ordered Huevos rancheros, the eggs were perfectly cooked the ranchero sauce was good, between the 3 tortillas were beans, peppers and onions avocado on top, served on potatoes. The pico de gallo was flavorful but not hot enough for me as I am used to Tex mex. The Coffee was quite good and the service was friendly.
