Wherever there are chips and salsa, we'll be there.
Wherever liberty is threatened, you will find...
The Three Amigos!

This place is no Ned Nederlander! It's definitely more of a Lucky Day (If you have no idea about the movie Three Amigos...you're completely lost...but that's okay...well...for me anyhow)!

Situated in the neighborhood of...not sure I really want to park my car here, Three Amigos brings a robust assortment of great tasting Mexican dishes. I've eaten many of their dishes and enjoyed all of them. If you're looking for Mexico...tough...if you're looking for great Mexican flavors that tend to aim for gringos...you're in luck.

The salsa and margaritas are so-so...but real salsa and real margaritas would likely make their patrons mad when they saw the price tag.

The inside is what you'd expect of a Mexican restaurant...and like many Mexican restaurants we've been to, they don't have a ton of space to maneuver. So if you hate rubbing elbows with people...not your place.

What to get: The Tacos al Pastor are spot on

What to avoid: Nothing really, just avoid the lofty expectations of your visits to Mexico
