lveadz48Q0_ke_p80D2rhg Awful experience!

I live in Las Vegas and my family came to visit and wanted to go to Isla because they had purchased a Groupon. We ordered drinks when we sat down, but didn't receive our drinks for a half hour. When we were leaving we noticed Happy Hour ended at 7pm, which was why we didn't receive our drinks right away, they were waiting for Happy Hour to end!

The food was ok, nothing to write home about. My boyfriend got a nacho and they served it with nacho cheese you get for a pretzel at the movie theater.

Also, during our meal we kept getting harassed by UNLV students who wanted to take our pictures. The photographer told us exactly how much money she makes per picture, which seemed like she was fishing for tips to make more. After 2 couples purchased the pictures, the student came back and told them that she needed MORE money because she forgot to charge them sales tax, and again repeated how they make no money doing this.

I would never recommend anyone to eat here; there are far better options both on and off The Strip.
