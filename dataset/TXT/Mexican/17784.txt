1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ A very dark day for the sauce lover indeed. We came here for dinner with our intentions to grab our typical favorite crispy tacos with all pulehu steak, nori rice, spicy red, mango corn, jalapeños, sour cream, guacamole and doused with the oh so amazing bottled pineapple lime jalapeño sauce. 

We were rudely awakened when we learned that the chef quit so they no longer have any of the incredible bottled sauces!!!! No more raspberry jalapeño, coconut colada pearl, guava & habanero, pineapple lime jalapeño (that was my main reason for being a fan!) I don't think I can return, not until I know they sorted out the sauce situation.

Honesty, I think the pulehu steak is delicious, packed with flavor, and moist, also the tacos have a wonderful crispy texture - but without the sauce, they just taste naked. 

You broke a sauce junkie's heart. :(
