SUd3IyEN7n5OYEGyt_U5lg This place is located inside a gas station. It's not really a sit down place. There are only 2 small tables with a few chairs inside. I don't really see people eating here whenever I come in. Most people order for takeout. I have eaten here many times and this place never disappoints me. The food is amazing. My favorite is their burrito. I always get the al pastor burrito with chicken and it is mouth watering, finger licking delicious. Customer service here is also friendly even though the wait can be lengthy most of the time. It's best to order online ahead of time for pickup. Their limón water (sort of a light lemonade) is also delicious. Definitely recommend this place for any Mexican food lover.
