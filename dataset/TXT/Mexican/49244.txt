8nNB_yG1gzVpbqNH2EBucg I have not been here since 2011. Hard to believe yes. However, we came here the other night for a friends Birthday. We came for Happy Hour.
I will start by saying we had the nicest server. This guy was great. He was very attentive and new the menu well.
He even brought out a dessert for my Friends Birthday. She was very happy as they even lit candles in it.
All the drinks we got were on special for HH.We ordered Cat fish Tacos, which are in a soft shell, a little different but, we all liked them. We also got chips and Salsa with Queso.,very good indeed. As well as fried Catfish strips, they were really great.
We had a nice evening and excellent service.
Lots of Parking and restrooms were clean and well maintained.
