MAuSh7NKoT__CQ4BumoayA Went to eat around 7pm and called in advance to ask if reservations were required...they are not. Waited 5-10 minutes to be seated which isn't bad for a Saturday night but wish there was a seating  area while you wait. 

The Pomegranate Açai Margarita was so delicious!! And well worth the $ as it had a good amount of alcohol in it. 
Chips and salsa was addicting...just spicy enough to keep you going for more. 
Ordered chicken quesadilla as an appetizer. It was very tasty.
I ordered a combo fajita which although delicious, it was a rather small portion for its cost. The shrimps were my favorite! 

The waiter was great! The atmosphere was very nice and the music was perfect...not too slow or fast while you eat. The price was a bit on the higher end which didn't compensate for the portion sizes but did for the flavor. 

Would return again to try other dishes and for the same margarita.
