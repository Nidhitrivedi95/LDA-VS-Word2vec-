as_fyujgsdwtV56n31z-Sw First time at Bomba Tacos and was really excited to try it. Our service was great.. our waitress was busy and attentive and very knowledgeable. We started off with the classic guacamole and added corn and a salsa. The guac was amazing and the chips that came with it was so good! whole grain and plantains. YUM, The salsa was not good.. we got the fire roasted tomato one.. literally tasted like fire roasted tomatoes out of a can. We also ordered a snack of popcorn- it was okay.. tasted just like regualr kettle corn with some seasoning.. not worth $4.

We each got 4 tacos.. i got the chicken rio, pork, and braised beef.. they were all different and delish but nothing to brag about.

Overall they have a diverse menu and the food is okay.. but everything was just 'Okay'.
