SEjyjYlMfFFzkHaru6JadA The only reason I am giving this 1 star is because the waitress/bartender was super nice.

This place is disgusting. We came to eat in the morning around 10am, and were seated in the dining area by the bar.  There is this streamer decoration hanging over the seating area. It was caked with dust which was falling into our food, drinks and you could see the dust in the air.

The food was really gross and soggy. It wasnt flavorful at all. The tables were caked with dirt. Somebody had actually scratched the caked dirt on the table and wrote 'dirty'. How can you not notice that when cleaning? The plates were chipped and had some dry food caked to it. I am very thankful that I didnt get food poisoning at this place. We will NOT be back.
