4DLsC4BTUoEqFGusetQVlQ I'm always a fan of this place. The atmosphere is this super chill, almost grungy underground feel that makes it a perfect place to just have a few drinks and hang out with friends. You can always expect to wait for at least an hour if you head there on a Friday or weekend, so try and make reservations if you can. I always get the chips, and you must get it with the guac! The corn salsa is not my favourite but I did like the spicy bean and queso, but the guac is what you neeeeed to get. For tacos I'm not the biggest fan of the chicken one (too much peanut sauce imo) but I do love the chorizo and fish one. I was surprised at how good the rose pitcher was too, I was with 2 others and we ended up getting about 2.5 glasses each for the price (but if you go on a Sunday it's only $30 instead of $50). Otherwise, always love this place and a go to for Mexican!
