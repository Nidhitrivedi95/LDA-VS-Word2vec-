O_UC_izJXcAmkm6HlEyGSA I came because of the yelp reviews. But now I'm going to keep coming because the food proved itself. It's soooo good. It's a little bit pricier than some of the other places in Kensington Market but they offer some really good stuff here. One of my personal favorite is the Playa burrito. It's so filling you can probably split it with someone. They also have a really big patio at the back so don't be fooled by how tiny the storefront looks. Service was really slow but good made up for it.
