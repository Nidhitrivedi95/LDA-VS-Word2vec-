d8Kz48UDfZ0MPuQpGy2r0Q Food was great. I wanted to try this place before it became the next big Toronto rooftop lounge & restaurant. The rooftop terrace with pool is gorgeous and the view of Toronto is great. Ambiance is 10/10 and service is very attentive. Only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the portions are a bit too small for the price. Be prepared for a pretty high bill if you came hungry. I knew this going in so it was exactly what I expected. For 2 people, you'll definitely need to order 2-3 full-size dishes or 3-5 half-size dishes.  The truffle fries, quinoa salad and prawns were amazing, definitely recommend trying those.
