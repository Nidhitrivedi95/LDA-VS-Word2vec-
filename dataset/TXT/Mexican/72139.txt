c6lzPktduqtKqRSnX_CUTg Went there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon with my family. Great place with delicious food, awesome service and cool ambiance. We all ordered something different and shared it amongst us...turns out everything was delicious. We ordered the grilled octopus, peach salad, sliders, little taquitos, and a few other things. The prices were fair and the best part everything tasted fresh! Definitely will be coming back to try to the rest of the menu and check out their Flamenco performance! 

We didn't mind the TVs as others have mentioned as I can see myself coming here to watch a sporting event and staying away from the rowdy crowds at the other bars. 

I really hope the words gets out and people check out this beautiful gem! There's an amazing mural of Frida Kahlo that's must to check out when you go there as well!
