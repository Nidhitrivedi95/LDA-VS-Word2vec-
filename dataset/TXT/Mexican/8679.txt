_u1Bq7QsgMUXSMex8QHqLQ Oh hell yeah!!!!!

My first experience with a burrito place in Canada and we randomly walked into here, oh thank the universe for this perfectly placed dwelling for a dining adventure. 

Reasons why I love burrito boyz vs. international burrito chainz:

** Easy burrito ordering options. I don't have to be asked dozens of questions during the assembly of my food.

***They have fish!!! Real fish, real tasty fish. You can actually eat this and stand up straight afterwards....yummy fish!!!

*****They have a fresh selection of delicious beverages, gotta wash that food down with something other than soda

***Price, they hooked up a nice sized portion of food for a very reasonable price. A bit less than those international guys.

**That first bite!!! OMG, I thought I had hit every angle in my burrito eating experience, but baby was I wrong. It was packed full of flavor without tons of seasoning and retained the essence it's mexican upbringing. 

****I think the main reason it was so good was the fact they grill it, I have never seen this, heard of this, or had wet dreams about grilled burritos until now. I'm forever addicted and might have to move from Denver to Toronto and develop a long drawn out affair with the Burrito Boyz and their food...a healthy one to boot. 

******Last, they strategically use the letter Z in the name of their joint, which I'm a very big fan of. My passport might soon read Zhane instead of Shane.


Props Boyz, you dun good yo!!!!
