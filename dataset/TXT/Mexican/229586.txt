SEjyjYlMfFFzkHaru6JadA Great Mexican restaurant.  The Bar Side is dimily lit and has a dark ambiance.  The Restaurant side is larger and well lit and comfortable.  Visited here after New Years Eve on the Bar side and also during the Days in the restaurant.  The service has been excellent.  The food has been just as excellent.  Whether having an entree or the buffet style, the food has been fresh.  Check it out after work, or after the club, even the late night or is that early morning munchies.
