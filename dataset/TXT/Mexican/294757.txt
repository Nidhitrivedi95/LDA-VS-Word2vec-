za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw Came to old town with some friends and we decided to come to this place for lunch. The interior of the restaurant  has absolutely nothing special about it (tables, chairs, and 2 televisions. The restaurant appeared to be clean, the staff was good and the food came out a fair about of time (8 people party). I had the grilled chicken sandwich with 50 /50 fries & onion rings. The food was good and the food portion was large enough to fill a normal person. I eat a lot since I workout and my order didn't fill me up. The rest of my party also had good food portions. The price was decent as well. This is a good place to come to if you are just looking for a hamburger / sandwich joint.
