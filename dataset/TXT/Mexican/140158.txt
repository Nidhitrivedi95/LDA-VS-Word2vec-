J7B-hSSYDYSIQx5xiqOJTw Besides the table side guac - I don't have anything good to say about this restaurant. We waited well over 30 minutes for a seat (2 people) and I counted at least 20 open seats at tables they apparently were not seating. We arrived just after happy hour ended and the margs while tasty were way to small for the price they were charging. The table side guac was well done and made to your tasting but the tacos were thrown together poorly and were just mediocre. My wife and I love Mexican and are pretty easy to please but unless I have a meeting or reason to be in Solon we will not be making a special trip back.
