zI4DTA_uiYmdLiGirl3ylA We tried Guacamole's on 4/30/17 and we're so glad we did.  We were seated immediately and asked about drinks and told that we would get some chips shortly and to help ourselves to the salsa bar.  A basket of warm, fresh chips and white bean dip arrived with drinks.  The bean dip is very good.  From the salsa bar, we sampled the fresh pico de gallo, the creamy spicy jalapeno sauce and the traditional red salsa.  All were very flavorful.  We got a small guacamole to share before our entrées came and it was not made table-side, but was very good.  I think they only make the large size at your table.  We did not partake, but the table beside ours got the special $3 house margaritas - great deal! 
There is an extensive menu.  For our entrées, we had the chicken and steak fajitas for two.  This came out very quickly; right after our guac.  It arrived hot and sizzling with delicious pieces of meat, onions, zucchini and bell peppers.  Accompanying the platter was a plate for each of us that had refried beans, Spanish rice, lettuce, sour cream and more guacamole.  We both mentioned that the rice was super delicious as we're used to flavorless, hard and sometimes crunchy rice at a Mexican place.  They had no problem bringing me corn and my husband flour tortillas; three each.  Our drinks and chip basket were kept full throughout the meal.  I had to keep my husband from scraping the skillet to get all the caramelized goodness before we both waddled out of here.  
Overall, this was a well-priced, delicious and simple dinner.  We'll be back for sure.
