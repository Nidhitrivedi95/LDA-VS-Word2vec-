First thing when we walked in, there were no hostesses or servers to be seen (it was not anywhere near busy, either).  A few minutes later we go seated.

I had the chicken flautas and chicken tortilla soup. Soup was honestly very tasty. My father had a chimichanga of sorts, which he loved. Good portions, delicious chips and salsa.
My sister on the hand had a bit of trouble. She ordered a 1 item lunch combo, with cheese enchilada (vegetarian). Neither the rice nor beans were veg, but that was to be expected given the use of lard and chicken stock in Mexican beans and rice. So we simply asked if there was another side we could substitute. Now, my sister and I both work in food service as well, and this seemed like a reasonable suggestion. Except they offered nothing. Not even a side salad... unless you could the pile of shredded iceberg lettuce with an olive and some blue cheese dressing a viable "side salad replacement" that the server so "generously" offered us. Of course, both enchilada sauces ALSO contained lard, so she essentially got a corn tortilla with some cheese and a heaping pile of iceberg lettuce. Pretty disappointing, knowing what else should have been done in such situations.
