oq8qksFNfHVyQwcZsQIN8A So I've been meaning to go here since they opened and today I got my chance. 
I asked for an arepa with carnita's and they had a plate of plantains and I asked if they were selling them as well. 
The good man said you like plantain? Of course I said yes and he proceeded to make me an arepa that was out of this world. 
Carnita plantain black bean and crumbled cheese. 

I work in town less than a half dozen blocks away and will be coming back here often. Cash only for now so hit up the ATM there are many close by. 

It's next to the garage on Cherry Way where the old Primantis Bros was located.
