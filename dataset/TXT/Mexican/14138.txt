The shop itself is quite small with standing tables to eat food. It was also super hot inside the place. I know this place is new so they're figuring some kinks out but ordering/waiting for food takes awhile. 

We got the pork, spicy beef, and chicken tacos, as well as the beef nachos. The tacos were super good, we just wished there was more filling in the tacos, especially because they are $3 each. The nachos were sooooo good, especially the queso they put on them. I feel like the nachos are more worth the price (~$6) because you get a lot of everything. We also wished they weren't canned jalapeños but overall the flavors of everything were great!
