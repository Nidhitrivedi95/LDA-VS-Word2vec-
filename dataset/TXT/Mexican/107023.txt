FoKx_RP4kUM-aiGo3wlUUw My favorite Mexican spot in North Phoenix. The carnitas are terrific as are the shrimp dishes. The Carne Asada is good, just short of great. The portions are huge and the prices more than reasonable. 

I take my son, so I can't partake in the cheap and plentiful margaritas. But I do get a churro or two off of his kid's meal, which is a ton of food for $5 with dessert. 

The staff is friendly and the environment comfortable and generally clean. I say it is the best option for a casual meal in and around the Metro Center.
