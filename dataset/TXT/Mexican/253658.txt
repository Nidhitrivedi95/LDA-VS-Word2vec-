V_RD57ea9ATcoryET1vTkA Really? This what we waited and called and checked on to see if they were open, months of waiting for an overpriced chipotle with a bar. We used to live this place. There are much better locations. Nice try, nice fail Woody's. They should pull the franchise from them.

As for the service the staff is great try as they may and as sweet as they are, you can't sell this crap as Macayo's.

Yes I still tipped well I'm not an asshole. But we will not be back. 

Also wtf where is the fried ice cream!!! Could you not make that hip and cool?
