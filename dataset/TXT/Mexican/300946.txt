zr2wA55AskfBJxrvUeDZRA I am now convinced locals don't know about burritos, let alone what a taqueria is.  I will give Tejano some credit for there were some decent flavours in the veg burrito I had here, but it didn't explode and was a floppy small size.  Their service was slow and precious in that hipster 'we're artisans' type way.  Too bad Montreal doesn't have a full-on taqueria like you find in Cali and the SoWest of the US - it would be huge  here.  The closest I have found here, at least in burrito size and flavours, is Cantina in Pointe St. Charles (their owners are from SanFran and know what constitutes a superior burrito).  Frick I miss the taquerias I enjoyed in the US.
