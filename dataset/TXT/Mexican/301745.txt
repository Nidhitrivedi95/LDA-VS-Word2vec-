zW0a510NN0P2n4tqKeIRBw Working odd hours it is hard to find places that are open and offer great, fast service. Using Yelp I was able to find this location and it happened to be 24 hrs!! I pulled in the drive thru. The gentleman that assisted me was very polite. Right off the bat he advised me they could only do cash transactions at the moment which was fine by me. I ordered my food and pulled up. I was handed my drink promptly and had a small conversation while waiting for my food. Great way to distract consumers while waiting for freshly made food! I got my food along with enough napkins and sauce to fix up my meal. I enjoyed my experience throughout the entire process and I normally don't have any care one way or the other when it comes to fast food restaurants. Definitely worth the extra drive time!! Way to go night crew!!
