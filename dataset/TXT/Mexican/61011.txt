arpBUwgiaE8iqfNGMQ_hgg I'm not the biggest burrito connoisseur, but my dinner date for the early evening was and he says that albeit big and fat, that BFB's burritos are "allllllright". I opted for tacos (one "vegetarian" filled with rice and beans and the other seasoned ground beef) and was satisfied. 

The street-facing seats are prime people watching spots and great for those warm (or just sunny winter) days when Kensington is abuzz with energy. I found it a little chilly on the windy night that we ate there, but the Ramones playing overhead kept my leg tapping.
