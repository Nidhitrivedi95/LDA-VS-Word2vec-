CuP3Z3CUZrV22FytT_uZ1A Ordered online and waited at the register for almost 20 minutes. I don't mind having to wait, what I do mind is that being told I get to go to the front of the line if I order online and then sit there and have to wait is ridiculous. It sucks cause this is so close to home but I guess I'll have to go out of the way to eat chipotle now.
