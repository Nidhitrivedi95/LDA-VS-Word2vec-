havUcqU5tH0zorHxCxGj8A I love this place! That says a lot, being a native Litchfield Parkian, I'm pretty nostalgic/upset/happy/thrilled/worried about whatever business may go into the strip center there (is it still called Tierra Verde Village?) Anyway, Old Pueblo has definitely been embraced by the community and those of us wayward natives who have left the area. 
Fine Mexican food. Only one time was I disappointed with what I ordered. They have a full bar and karaoke, outdoor and indoor seating. It's a lovely place - lovely. Peter has done a great job on this place. Just love it.
