cdkzUI1tXc8rUMF33iKMlg Best Friend and I decided to attend the Craft Crawl last night, with Vida Vida being one of sponsors as well as she wanted to try it for the first time we decided to go. The waiter whom was really nice but unfortunately he had NO support. Her friend came out first and I waited anthoner 10 min for mine which OK we have worked in the restaurant field so we understand, until the party next to us received their food within 10 min of sitting and ordering as well as all together.
