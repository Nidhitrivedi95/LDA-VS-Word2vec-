xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw I found the bane of my pregnant existence: a giant slab of fry bread loaded with beans, lettuce, cheese, grilled onion, and sour cream.. also known as the Vegetarian Taco. 

The place isn't too big, and you place your order at the counter and wait for it. The food comes fast though, and when ours did, I gulped in anxiety over how to tackle the taco.. it's h u g e. Just give in, get a pile of napkins [and a moist towelette] and grab that delicious morsel with both hands and understand it's messy. It was love at first bite for me, tasting every ingredient nestled between two sides of one delicious piece of fry bread. 

For dessert, my husband and I split a powdered sugar fry bread, and as he was so full from his green chili beef taco, I got most of it. 

Bring your appetite and leave your Biltmore ladies behind, because hearing how fattening this wonderful place is would be a total buzzkill.
