MM572Htt9k_e96IKNyCEtA We went here last night for az restaurant week and we very happy! We were sat outside and really enjoyed the atmosphere and zen music being piped through. They served beers from local az breweries which was a nice touch, I ordered a four peaks peach beer that's one of my faves! For our 1st course I got a salad and my husband got the fondue, both were delicious! Then for the 2nd course we got the short ribs and shrimp and grits and loved both of them. Then had an apple pie and chocolate cake for dessert, again both were yummy. Our waiter was also very friendly and attentive. We really enjoyed our meal and will definite be back!
