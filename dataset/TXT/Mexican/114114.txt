gEv1Og5uGDLw9HkbKSGUZw I hosted a party of 25 here last night and from beginning to end it was an amazing experience! I'm from NYC and planned the event from tree so there were many opportunities for things to go wrong however that never happened. 

The manager, extremely courteously, went above and beyond to ensure we had everything we needed and even brought down high hat tables from upstairs to make the room more to what I envisioned before coming in. 

Out waitress Alyssa was excellent. She could not have been more friendly and efficient. The Tacos....oh the Tacos!!! They were great, reminded me of trips to San Diego and Hawaii. Margarita Pitchers were generous in Tequila and delicious.  

There was a DJ there (Sat nights) who was playing a great mix and many 90s throwbacks which was also fun. 

All in All an amazing night. Will definitely return next time I'm in town.
