fGnILhhgE393e-8X9JIB4Q This is the place to find the most authentic Mexican food in all of Toronto & GTA! The food is fresh and the service is friendly. They have a taco bar where you can pick and choose the sauces and garnishes to customize your tacos and nachos. Prices are very reasonable as well (ex. ~$7.99 for 3 tacos). They also have a drinks menu! Definitely worth the trip to Vaughan for this place!
