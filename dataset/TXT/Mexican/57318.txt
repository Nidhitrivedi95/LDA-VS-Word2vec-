The Beef rib in particular, was pathetic. the meat portion of this dish would fit in a tablespoon; for $17+. Not acceptable. We've all bought beef ribs, we know the cost. Even if you factor the cooking, the mole and the presentation, the markup on this menu item is criminal. So I had to order more as a result. I didn't plan to order more.

Great place if you are a) wealthy AND b) you want to impress someone without going to a pretentious place.
