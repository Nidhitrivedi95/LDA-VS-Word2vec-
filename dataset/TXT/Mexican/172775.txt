medCzwjjGeReqxOt-iPVTg If I could give a  negative star I would.  Stay away folks the drive up cashiers are idiots.  Ordered carne asada fries and super nachos carne asada.  Clearly ordered no onions.   The receipt even stated no onions.  Got home and guess what?  Tons if onions.  I called they said Come back tomorrow we will make it good.  I should have wrapped it up and let it ferment overnight.  Because when I got there the little tart cashier starts lecturing me about they will only do it this once.  Damn right I will only go once because when you mess up my order  I don't come back .  I only went back because $20 is a lot to pay for the those two items.  I don't need a lecture or any accusations that I was lying. When I get there some idiot pretends he is the owner which obviously he wasn't since he started yelling at me. Had to drive off and left their cacca asada fries for them to eat.  I predict they won't be their too long.  Business don't survive with idiots behind the cash register.
