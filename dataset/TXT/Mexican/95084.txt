EC7NrIHKk6i3US_XJlDWDA Best shredded beef tacos in all of Scottsdale/ Phoenix!!! Thank you so much for having them. Being from Los Angeles I was so excited that an amazing tacos place was down the street from our favorite hotel in n old town Scottsdale! Also the chips are so thin and crispy, definitely very fresh. Everyone working looks super happy, so you know the service us gonna be good if the staff is happy! Thanks again, we'll definitely be back!
