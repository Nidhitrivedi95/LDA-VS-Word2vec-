oBABBuVRfIump4jHKlJmHg Went there on a Friday night to grab some drinks and a bite to eat. We ordered the salsa appetizer, I had the mushroom and cheese quesadilla with whole wheat tortillas with a glass of wine, and my husband got a margarita with wings. The food, I must say was pretty good. Our waitress seemed like she was new, as she spilled our dip all over the table. She served someone else before she wiped it up. When my quesadilla came out, it looked like it was on a white tortilla-I asked, and sure enough it was. She comped the entrée for the inconvenience and apologized many times, which was appreciated. Despite these few issues, we really enjoyed our night there and I'm not sure if it's the low lighting, or the booths, but I really like the ambiance at this particular Mad Mex. I do wish they had more drink specials for a Friday night. Even so, everything was delicious and they had lots of vegetarian options. I'm sure we'll be back.
