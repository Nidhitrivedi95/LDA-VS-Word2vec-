JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg Best margaritas I've ever had. Hands down. My hubby and I shared a pitcher of the El Dorado Margarita and it was enough to get a good buzz going on. We wish we came when we were hungry because the food here is apparently amazing, but we made the mistake of having Bacchanal's Buffet earlier in the day so we are stuffed.

That just means we'll be back next time though! Great service here too. If you don't mind the fact that it's next to Sapphire's, definitively check out this gem off the strip.
