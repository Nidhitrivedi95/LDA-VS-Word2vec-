JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg Love the decor & my friend had faved on about how great it is!  We shared the Street Tacos, which were carnitas, carne asada & shredded chicken & the Chicken Enchiladas w/ Green Tomatillos Sauce.  I like how they shape the Cilantro Rice in a flower looking mold & the margarita's were good!  However, the sauce was good, but the chicken was dry.  The chicken half of my meal was not good.  The other half was ok.  

After eating at lots of Mexican restaurants, I have had simple chicken enchiladas & tacos come out moist & much better.  Since my friend loves it, maybe next time I'll try whatever he loves or maybe our palate is different.
