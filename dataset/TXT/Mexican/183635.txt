NOfbzTpQ7hrt6ZbJVeXUUw Only 4 because we only had drinks and nachos, not dinner. (update to come)
The Margarita were a little different and very good. The nachos were also different and good.
Don't look for REAL Mex food but, enjoy their version!
We had to ask for the server's name because we were very impressed with her!!
Thank you Brittney!!! hope you're our server when we return.
