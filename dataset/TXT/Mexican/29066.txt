3yymiTfNro2fmv6FedUW3w I am such an idiot for believing this food poisoning thing was over. Don't make the same mistake I did!! I went tonight (2/27), had a steak bowl, and spent the wee morning hours throwing up & in the worst stomach pain of my life. Guess what people! It's not over. Reporting to CDC in the morning. RIP Chipotle. I will miss you.
