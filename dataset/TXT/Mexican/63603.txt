b_2SSLpmL8rWUhwGETseFA OK so let me just start by saying that I literally drive 20 miles just to eat at tacontento.
My boyfriend (alberto)is very very picky with he's food and I would never thought he would give a food truck a try,but he did and let me tell you guys that he is addicted!!!since we live soooo far from this food truck we go once a week and every single time the food has been amazing.
The guy in the register is super nice,the ladies cooking look very clean and have the passion to serve the best of the best.
Do I recommend this location? Oh absolutely! They have so many choices of meals and meats to accommodate anyone's appetite.

Keep up the great work/food tacontento! :)
