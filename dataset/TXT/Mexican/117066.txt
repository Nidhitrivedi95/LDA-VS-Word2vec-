gOBxVkHpqtjRRxHBIrpnMA As a former devotee to Chipotle burritos while I was living in the US, I certainly mourned their dearth here in Toronto.  While I travel to the States frequently, I have to admit that one burrito a year may not suit when you have a sudden Chipotle craving. I even sent them an email asking for a location to be opened about two and a half years ago, so in my twisted brain I'd like this to mean that I can take credit for it.

The one thing I don't like about this Chipotle, although I can hardly blame them for it, is the location.  Dundas Square is a place I consider to be malltown for tourists, rubes and other people that don't know anything about the city.  But with all the other mega chain restaurants in the area, and the heavy foot traffic down Yonge, I'm sure it seemed like a no-brainer to the number crunchers at Chipotle.

Most of us are sadly aware that Toronto has a terrible Mexican food situation, and even Tex-Mex or American influenced Mexican places are at a premium right now. Chipotle is the latter - mission style burritos done perfectly.  The menu is sparse on other accounts, because they do something right and don't split their focus with a lot of other entrees.  I hope that Chipotle can serve as a beacon or goalpoint for the current and future restaurants who want to serve burritos in this city - maybe they'll be a good influence.

If you're unfamiliar with the chain take a look around their website, which explains their goals and back story.  The chain has some really great corporate policies, including using ethically-raised meats and environmentally sound ingredients and packaging.  It may be a chain, but McDonalds this place ain't.
