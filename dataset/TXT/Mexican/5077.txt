-x2NjuDTiphKwCixSrv_SQ I was literally just there for dinner on Saturday, September 23, 2017.  It was open and it was fantasic.  In fact, they added some new decor.  Nothing that will truly impress but there are now tableclothes on the tables and some other minor things that'll make one smile.  Food is the exact same, delicious authentic mexican which gets no better in Pittsburgh or the surrounding metropolitan area.
