iIFMeiovZ2o7RzJ_1YYVww They give free chips and salsa!! The salsa they give is a green salsa. It's freaking delicious. Like one of the best salsas I've had from a restaurant.
I got a green chile tamale, carne asada taco, and beans. The beans were great. It was a nice size portion too. They are creamy but not too thick, with a crumbly cheese on top. The green chile tamale was good. It wasn't very strong on the green chile, so you definitely get more of a masa taste. The tacos are street style, open faced. It tasted super fresh, and the meat was cooked well.
My boyfriend got a cabeza taco, that was well done too. He also got 3 quesadillas. One spicy chicken, carne asada, and al pastor. They were all good. I liked the carne asada one the best. The chicken one wasn't super spicy, so if you have a low heat tolerance it's still perfect for you.
All said and done it was $20 for all the food and a bottle of coke. That's awesome! They don't have a card tip option so if you so want to tip, bring some cash!
