frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A Love the margaritas, extensive tequila menu & the food is great! Great salsa bar! A great place to bring family & friends when visiting Phoenix. Only downside was that they are a little short staffed & takes a little while to get yr drinks & food. Plan to be there a little while, but in the end, it's all worth it!.
