lWmDrnqgU6w3gFaJyn_1Uw Awesome atmosphere, creative and very well prepared food, excellent wines and beers, and great service. The space is very well done in a mix of old Champaign with some more subtle modern features. 

Ate here on a visit from Seattle and was very impressed. My steak was one of the tastiest, most tender cuts I've had anywhere (including any upscale steak house). The gnocchi was outstanding. The prawns with the bacon, amazing.

I didn't think Champaign had cool restaurants with awesome food...was I ever wrong!
