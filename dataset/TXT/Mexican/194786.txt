OTcBXjDkViDPds4Lxy8KIQ A meal that I actually finished... get outta here!!!

This place is worthy of the 5 star title. The food is sooooo good it'll have you signing up for their rewards program and coming back. We were looking for a place where we both have never been and he remembered his friend had recommended this place. Well thank you, friend! I really enjoyed the people and the food.

I asked the lady who took our order what the most popular thing was. She suggested the sopapilla but I was almost tempted to get a burrito. My friend got a burrito so I figured I would get the sopapilla and we could share! What's a sopapilla? It's like stuffed fried or toasted bread. I was shocked at just how yummy it was. We also got chicken smothered fries to share, so delicious. His burrito was super good too, with the green sauce (which apparently is spicier than the red sauce).

Overall, the service was great and the food was even better. I want some more right now just thinking about it.
