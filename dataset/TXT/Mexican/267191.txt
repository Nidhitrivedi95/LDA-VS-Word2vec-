wJ84TZZTuT0EdLzPHt8RDw I would say Taco Bell is a step up. It was the blandest chicken taco I've ever had.! It also was laid on my beans so it was really nice to hold. The fish sandwich was tough and hard to eat. They forgot the sauce on it and the salad dressing.  Nothing special for the price.  Oh, and they forgot to bring out the fried ice cream they promised for my moms 70th bday.
