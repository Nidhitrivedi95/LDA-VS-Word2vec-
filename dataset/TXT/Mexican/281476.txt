XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg We have eaten at this place before and really loved the food.   This time (Jan 26) we were so disappointed! The service was sooo bad we didn't couldn't enjoy the food.  Just wanted to get out.  We had to wait after being seated for a long time, practically ignored and the food was just dumped at the table .  Poor, poor. The food was tasty, have to say, but we probably won't go back.  There are just too many  other excellent places that want your business.
