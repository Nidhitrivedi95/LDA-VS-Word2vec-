MhwAKgF54Rwmm4vkdIb0Lw Great food and excellent customer service! I had the fish tacos which were wonderful. My daughter ordered the California Bowl which was too spicy for her. The employees noticed she wasn't eating and asked if everything was okay; when we explained the issue they immediately offered to remake it without the spicy chipotle sauce. A great experience!
