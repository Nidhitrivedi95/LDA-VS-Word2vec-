pup46G8qFBG8695RtbQNwA Food was good. Price point a little high. Manager with the man bun extremely unprofessional to staff while we were sitting at the bar. After ordering our meal the manager felt like that was a fine time to bleach the floor. Was our first time into that location and our last. Not sure if that was black mold growing up the wall due to heavy rains that the staff was being told to cover with metal tables to stock drink glasses. Would Not recommend!
