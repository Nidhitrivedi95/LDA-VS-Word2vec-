Excellent restaurant.  From the time you walk in, you are immediately met by a very friendly staff and a very cool interior.  Not only do you get some really good chips and salsa but also then some fresh made refried beans to dip the chips into.  YUM.  Then, while deciding from their amazing menu they also bring out a small cup of some very good fideo soup.  YUM YUM.
The waiter was very friendly and attentive to our "special requests" and made some great suggestions.
I will admit, I was hungry and I was a pig!  I ordered combo #1 with a taco, chile relleno and a cheese enchilada and all were really good.  The relleno was one of the best I have had and I have eaten a lot of Mexican food.  My wife had the "Gallo al Conac" and it was simply amazing, not the normal Mexican fare with more of a white cream sauce.  She loved it.
This will be a new must stop restaurant for us whenever we are in Vegas.
