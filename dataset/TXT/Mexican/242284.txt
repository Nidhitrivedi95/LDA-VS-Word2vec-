Te-BqwJZt8S0fu9ltlq3Eg Stopped here for dinner on the way to Cleveland. My family was craving Mexican food, and I had a hard time finding a good Mexican Restaurant. This place left us satisfied! I ordered the dinner combination; for just $9.99 you get to choose three entree items that come with rice and beans. Also complimentary chips, salsa, and here's a unique one...cole slaw! 

I ordered a shredded beef tamale, shredded chicken tamale, and beef enchilada. I asked for no cheese when I ordered the enchilada, and everything but that had cheese, so I just scraped it off. The chips were really addicting, but the salsa tasted like the one from a jar. I LOVED the tamale-not too many places back home sell tamales so I had to try Los Gallos'. I wasn't too sure what was in the enchilada; it was like a chili-saucy consistency and I didn't see any meat. The shredded chicken taco was yummy, and I wolfed down the rice and beans. The black beans had a pico de gallo on top with tomatoes, corn, and carrots which was delicious. 

I was so full afterward; the portions are huge for the price you pay. Awesome deal! We were seated right away, service was prompt, but it took a bit to get the check.
