The place is a bit small and I can see it get cluttered if their business improves. I've been there 3 times and my only disappointment was when I ate half of my cousins shrimp burrito, the shrimp was overcooked. That being said, their steak burrito is great with tender meat and packed full of meat, rice, beans and anything else you'd find in a burrito.
