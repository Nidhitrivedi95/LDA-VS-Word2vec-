YSYDJTCt5kzY2kKnLNGRiA Fun place to come and get some authentic coastal Baja California Mexican food. Which means they do a lot more  of  seafood  and other dishes rather than northern Sonoran food which is the taco burrito base that most are use to also known as Tex Mex.They have great happy hour specials on both food and drink, Plus  live music some nights of the week. Also is located in the Scottsdale quarter which has lots of great shopping restaurants and bars to choose from. Definitely should come by and check it out
