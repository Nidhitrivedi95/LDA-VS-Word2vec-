geQG2a9uO6Q9hXVx937Kbw I'm not sure if I came at a bad time but the staff weren't friendly at all. I told the lady who was making my bowl that I didn't want any hot sauce or anything that was spicy. However, she proceeded to add hot sauce and after reminding her, she then added jalapeños. When I got my food, the halibut was rock hard and tasted like cardboard. It was my first time coming to this location and needless to say it will be my last. There's a Chipotle right around the corner that has better service and way better quality.
