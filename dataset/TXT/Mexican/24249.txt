2TZl160uaMAg1cr8KFbk8Q food prices are high but seriously over $9 for an "okay" machete.  not to mention i had to order (3) times because they were out of this or that.  i wanted beef and each time the girl asked me if i would like to order chicken.  what was chicken on sale or brought from their farm?  i definitely will not be going back there
