0vdw9E5zzYDNsW_smjBmHA We moved to Chandler from Tempe 6 months ago and dig this little place. Their homemade tortillas, which they sell, are fantastic! Love their chorizo and egg breakfast. Their chorizo has good flavor without being too hot. The potatoes are crisp on the outside and soft inside...yum! Beans are done right too. We've eaten in each time and the staff is very pleasant. They're only open 7-2 so plan accordingly and buy some tortillas to take home. We're lovin this place!
