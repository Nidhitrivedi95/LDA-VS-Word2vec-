Staff: Service was friendly but was a bit slow. They did come by every so often to let us know that the food was coming a few times. Luckily, I was with great company so I didn't notice the lag time as much.

Ambience: When you enter from the street there is a long corridor leading up to the entrance, so that made it harder to spot. When you walk in there was a big open space and some tables in the back. The seats were comfy and the décor was nice.

Food: I had the Chicken Chimichanga which was super delicious and perfectly filling; I highly recommend it. I also tried each flavour of empanadas (Cheese, Chicken, Beef and Chorizo). The Chorizo and Cheese were good but the Chicken and Beef were not very flavourful. For dessert I had the Churritos and they tasted as expected, though I wish there was more on the plate for $7.

Overall, the Chimichanga was the highlight for me!
