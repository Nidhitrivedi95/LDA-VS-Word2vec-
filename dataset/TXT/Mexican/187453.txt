O1ird5yRyuDFnOmYu90OoA I am actually surprised at how much I enjoyed my time here this time. The last time I would say could only be described as, eh. This time I had fun, the food was good, and the drinks were affordable! All things that I think anyone would be looking for in a place. I will say that we went for happy hour and they were accommodating to 5 people with plenty of tables for us to pick and they had really fast service! FREE CHIPS AND SALSA!! 

I was loving the $5 taco deal. You had your choice between, something, something, something else, and fish. I of course picked fish because it is what I am always drawn to. I don't even remember any of the other choices, because when you can pick fish why pick anything else?!

The plate for $5 came with two fish tacos. I will not say that these were the biggest tacos I have ever seen but they did fill me up without leaving me stuffed. I enjoyed them. AND THEY ARE SERVED WITH CORN TORTILLAS. Personal favorite. 

I also got the $5 sangria. It came in a tall mason jar and hit the spot. It wasn't overly sweet and was topped with just a simple orange slice. I thought that was nice, more room for the booze and less room for fruit that would be hard to eat/get out of the jar. 

So for about $10, not including tip I had a really fulfilling meal. What else would anyone want other than that!? 

I will say the wait staff was super helpful and really nice. I was happy we picked Round Corner.
