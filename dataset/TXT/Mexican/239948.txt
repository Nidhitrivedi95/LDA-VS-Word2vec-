T2tEMLpTeSMxLKpxwFdS3g This is my favorite place ever. I'm originally from Blacksburg which is where the only other Cabo is located, and I'm not going to say that Cabo was the sole reason we picked the NoDa neighborhood to relocate to, but it was definitely a factor.  This place holds a special place in my heart, and my tummy. My go to order (I literally do not stray from this, ever): Lemon Grilled Shrimp Tacos with the Guacamole Pasta Salad.
