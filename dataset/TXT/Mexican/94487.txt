Juan Gonzalez Taqueria is an affront to taco joints in the city. I haven't been to a Taco bell in about 20 years but I am fairly sure there would be more flavour in their horrid attempt at an Al Pastor taco than the pathetic plate that was served up to me at this place.

At 3.99 per taco you might think it would be a damn fine taco. My Al Pastor taco was a pathetic mess of 60% overcooked pork that was seasoned with something that added no flavour, 10% pineapple that wasn't very ripe, 20% diced onion, and 10% cilantro.

The ONLY redeeming feature was the bottled Horchata, which has a cinnamon stick inside the bottle to really bring out that flavour.

If you want decent tacos, consider a walk to Kensington Market or further east along Queen. Definitely not recommended.
