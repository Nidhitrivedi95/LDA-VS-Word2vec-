7QThNKBZfCNDsCaWRoejMw One thing to know : The Burrito is huge

Filled with rice and black beans, and your choice of meat (chicken, beef) or veggie, any option you'll choose will fill you up.

You can decide to go for something a bit lighter like the Quesadillas, with sour cream, and your choice of salsa.

It's all pretty fresh but it's still a "fast food" joint so I wasn't that impressed.

I tried the "M4 beer" with coriander but am still waiting to taste the coriander.

Good place if you're in a hurry and wanna have something else than a cheap burger.
