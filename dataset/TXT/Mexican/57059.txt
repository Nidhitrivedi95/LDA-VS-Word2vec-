A8MmwHrMI0WnRTyQMdf8aQ Actually a 2.5.

I never knew we had a Chipotle in Canada, so when I saw this one at square one I tried it without hesitation.

I got a burrito here - Shredded beef and Chips on the side. I didn't realize it, but the chips were just nachos. Without any flavor. They were so bland... Waste of money in my opinion. 

The burrito was also not that tasty. I have had much better burritos at different Mexican places, and this just wasn't close to that standard. Really was a let down experience, but I will give them another try with a different flavor burrito the next time I'm in square one.
