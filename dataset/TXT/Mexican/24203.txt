What a mess! Yes, the teenagers were working here at about 8pm on a recent weekend and both of them screwed up royally.

Teenager 1 (female) - tells me that their chicken is white meat. It looks questionable, but took her word and then got home with the food and it was chicken from the dark meat side. She put alot of chicken in the burrito and that made getting out all the nasty pieces nearly impossible. Some chunks looks uncooked as well.

Teenager 2 (male) - overcharged me. It's $2.99 to add drink and cookie, but he rang up each item separate costing me the $1.50 I would have saved. Too much of a hassle on the refund after the card was already charged, so let it go, but bad training, service and a bad burrito made this an unbearable eating experience. 

Besides the extra veggies in the bins, the meats were old, nasty and just miserable looking. If you go here, get a veggie burrito to stay safe or turn around and leave to be safer. They focus too much on their ugly little green color scheme  but need to focus on what they serve. Oh, the cookies were decent.
