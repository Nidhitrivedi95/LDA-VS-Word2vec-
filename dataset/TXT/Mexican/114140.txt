gEv1Og5uGDLw9HkbKSGUZw This review is for the Saturday brunch. 

We came in with fairly high expectations for the food, and unfortunately we were a bit disappointed. Two of us split the Churro Pancakes and the Huevos Rancheros, and we were definitely satisfied portion-wise.

The Churro Pancakes were quite over-hyped. The churro itself had too much cinnamon, with the pancake being a bit dry. It was not fluffy as a pancake should be, and the flavour itself just wasn't there.

As for the Huevos Rancheros, the guacamole was the best part of the meal. It had a bit of spiciness, and the texture was very nice. The rest of the plate was okay - the papas bravas and beans were both decent but could have used a bit more seasoning/flavour.

The servers were quite nice, and the ambiance is quite relaxed, but this did not compensate for the overall average/mediocre food.
