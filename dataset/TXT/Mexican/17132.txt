1HfkEkNhI6XJXkgrCTBKpw I've been in Pittsburgh for a month on business staying the south side. This is by far the best bat I've been to. Awesome beer (58 craft brewd on tap) awesome food and very friendly/ attentive bar tenders. A great place that I recommend for happy hour drinks as well as dinner and late night.
