xyK7KUcJzWy1LlejwQpQMg One word. Gross.  I should have turned around and walked out when the smell hit me.  It turns out the smell was the sauce which is ladled on liberally over everything.  I was skeptical from the start and so just ordered something to share with sister.  So glad I didn't spend more. It was pretty bad - no flavor and soggy from the sauce.  Yuck. This one is off the list!
