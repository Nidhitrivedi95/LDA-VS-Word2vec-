R1PQEK6qvrZVC9qcWfKvDA Got the steak tacos for lunch. They were very delicious! The steak has a sweet marinade and is very tender. Ordered an Island Tea as well. It tasted just like Arizona Iced Tea, except in a smaller can that was double the price. 

The salsas are said to be spicy. My taco with the hottest salsa was pretty tolerable. Definitely not as hot as I was anticipating. All the salsas had good flavor though. 

It's also worth noting that the staff were very friendly and quick. I'd recommend this spot to anyone in the mood for tacos. 

I'm going with four stars because it was kind of pricy. 3 tacos and a can of iced tea came to $12. I guess this is cheap for Vegas standards, but I'm still going with four. Consider this five stars if that sounds like a deal for you.
