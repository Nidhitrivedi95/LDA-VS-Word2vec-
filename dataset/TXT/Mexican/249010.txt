UDucqwO8PwUOwcmUsJ-gOA Asadero is hands down my favorite restaurant in all of Arizona. It's a must-visit every time we go back to visit. It's a small, hole-in-the-wall restaurant with delicious food. I'm grateful to yelp for Asadero getting it's name out there more. Years ago, it was a word of mouth type place. Co-workers introduced me to it, I brought friends and family, and they'd bring their friends, etc. and it was like sharing a precious treasure, because their food is that good.
