Y2yWvcEBs6ESnmOQMBKkeQ Food was very fake, rather have popeye's church's. Had onion rings that had minced onion in it, nasty. Mashed potatoes made from powder. Employees asked us how it was and when we lied and said it was good you could hear them chuckling about it like really. Won't be back there again.
