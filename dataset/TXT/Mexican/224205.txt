RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg Came here after a buddy recommended a good taco spot. Upon arriving place was packed and super hot inside. I'm usually very impatient but my buddy swore it was wore it. 

Line went pretty quick ordered four tacos de el pastor and an order of carne asada fries. Also got a plate of grilled jalapeños and grilled green onions which were on point. Couldn't find any seating so we ate in the car. The food was on point and I'll be returning for sure!!! 

Don't leave sue to the long line the wait is worth it, trust me!!!
