Y2sqvs29NZvfpWxRXsI47Q I've been here a few times, the portions are great and most of the ingredients seem fresh. I love their baked chicken and get extra burrito sauce + a touch of the hot sauce. Last time I was there, I tried the "butter chicken". I know I shouldn't have had any high expectations but it was disappointing. I'll continue to stick with the plain baked chicken. 
They also do a good "burrito in a bowl", and I always ask for extra lettuce/veggies because they can be skimpy.
