fSmIQUcriQNu6hKkEoGgOQ We are regulars at this place....either place...Scottsdale or Mesa. Both locations are dependably good in their service, food quality and cleanliness.  

Great for families, couples, whatever.... Outside dining (mist system when its hot) and pretty good prices.  All around a good place to go anytime.
