c6lzPktduqtKqRSnX_CUTg The reviews for El Panzon Y Frida have been really great so far, I was super excited to check out this restaurant for a Happy Hour event! The space was a bit smaller than I expected but the decor and architecture seemed well thought out, it was very modern and eclectic!

We had gone for happy hour and in reviewing the menu, it seemed like a good deal with the few food and drink selections to choose from. I initially got the House Gyozas and Spicy Kale Dip appetizers to start. The gyoza were presented beautifully with veggies & garnish atop a citrus soy glaze. All of us agreed that the citrus soy was a little bit too salty, but I unfortunately was not a fan of this dish. I spoke with our server and he was gracious enough to offer to get me something else so I went with the Orange Beef taco bites. Those and the Kale Dip were phenomenal! The Orange Beef taco bites had tasty pieces of orange beef topped with jalapeño, citrus zest, and a light sauce; a little bit of sweet and spicy! All dishes looked amazing but my favorite was the Kale Dip as it had a lot of added color with the crudites (radishes, carrots, and cherry tomatoes). I personally enjoyed the toasted baguette most with the dip, however.

The head chef of the restaurant mentioned how art is their inspiration which was very evident by the attention to detail on the food. They source ingredients from local farmers and seem to work to create a unique experience for patrons. Overall, a great new addition to Old Town Scottsdale, we will be back!
