If you go with a big group, you'll probably need to segregate, the premises are tight, plus it gets really busy... On the other hand, this place is successfully intimate for couples (iiiiuuu), specially if you take into consideration the low lights, the sexy live music (some days), and the "makes everybody attractive" magic potion called tequila.

If I were a guy I would bring first dates here.

The bar pampers the eyes, what a beautiful image: all kind of tequilas and mezcales illuminated by a purple mystic light...

The musicians were delightful, I felted like dancing, and for an instant they transported me to the 1920's. Those $5 bucks for cover were worth. 

After having a huge dinner, the "Hola café" seemed like my best bet, boy it worked...! (excellent digestive)

We couldn't leave without refreshing our tongues with one of their heavenly fixed Palomas (a must taste).

Salud!
