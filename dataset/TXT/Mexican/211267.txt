qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A Went for lunch today (Wednesday) and it was a very good experience.  The place is definitely hipster based, but not obnoxious.  The menu is a bit limited, especially at lunch.  The flauta and shrimp/chorizo appetizers were fresh and excellent.  The salads were very fresh as were the ahi and salmon.  I had the New Mexico chili burger, it was tasty, but the burger had the consistency of mush, very strange.  Service was very good as well.
