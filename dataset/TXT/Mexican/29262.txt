423AAbu0yBoDMOeVwnLzkQ I live in the neighborhood and was so excited to see this place open. I gave it a couple weeks to get going before I stopped in. I wish I'd just kept walking... 
I ordered the ceviche. Mistake #1. It was absolutely the worst ceviche I've ever eaten. Served in a bar pint glass with store-bought chips in a Chili's/Appleby's type dish. The squid was the most rubbery-inedible thing ever, and the shrimp were definitely frozen. It tasted like they dumped cheap (also canned or store-bought) tomato salsa over some frozen seafood. Really really gross. I couldn't even eat it. 
My friend ordered 3 different tacos. His words exactly: "They aren't anything to get excited about. They're too small and there really isn't that much flavor...especially in the meat". 
Neither of us tried a cocktail, but if the food is any indication of the cocktail quality, count me out. 
I definitely won't be back to Camino, as I can find FANTASTIC tacos and drinks right across the bridge at Orale... It's a shame this place isn't better--downtown could really use a good taco spot. 
If you are in the mood for plastic/frozen food with very little imagination and poor quality ingredients... This is YOUR place. Enjoy.
