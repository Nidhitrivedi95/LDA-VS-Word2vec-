Ln3jC2yAs5KtopUDAhYZBA Let me start by saying I love Carls jr, the food taste great, but what happened today was absolutely unacceptable. I pulled up to this locations drive thru and was told by the girl that it would be awhile with no explanation. i waited in line for 13 minutes before anyone even asked to take my order. I then decided to back out and leave (forcing the other 3 cars in line to back out as well). Do better carls jr
