vQq_sX0kSAUdT3yLW06q5A I've been to the other two sister restaurants in the same plaza, but had not yet checked this one out.  It was a weeknight, and they were not all that busy, so it was a good chance to try out some of their popular dishes.  

The oysters Rockefeller / chips + salsa were really great appetizers.  It was my first time having oysters that way and will definitely not be my last.  The salsa was fresh and chips were perfectly warm and salted.

For the entrée I got the chorizo pizza - mostly because I like house made chorizo and wanted to give this unique twist on a pizza a shot.  When it arrived on the table, I saw all the fresh cabbage on top and remembered the last time I had lettuce / cabbage on a pizza was the time I tried a taco pie in Idaho - which was an epic fail.

This didn't fail as bad, because it gave the pie a nice crunch / texture alternative.  But the next day, as you might imagine, it didn't quite hold up.  The flavor combination just wasn't ideal and not something I'd order again.

That said, the service was solid and the appetizers were really good so when I come back I'll just try something else.
