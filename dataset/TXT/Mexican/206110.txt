PYx-VT43sMFANCEqoY2lAQ We live closeby and while we'd love to love this place, we just don't.  Every time we've gone, we've asked for a special way to order something, for example, no mushrooms on the veggie fajita.  Do you think they can get this right?  Nope.  Every time, mushrooms show up.  DH orders mole with his order sometimes.  Do you think they bring a cup of mole?  Nope.  We have to repeat our special requests every time.  We got tired of doing that, so we just stopped going.  The taco truck down the street across from Betty Jane school is much, much better.
