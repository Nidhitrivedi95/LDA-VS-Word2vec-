DyOzNIeXUksPNLXYHnB-oQ I really enjoy this place.  As fast casual goes, it's probably the best around.  Food is fats and good.  My favorite item is the yuca nachos.  I also like the arepas.  I have been with a couple friends who complained their tacos were expensive for what they got.

I really like the pineapple habanero salsa on the salsa bar, but it has serious kick.   

Good selection of local beers in can to buy as well.
