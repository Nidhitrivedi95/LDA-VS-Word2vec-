5idlmsT1O86_ywGJtqot5w Loved it! Swung by here for lunch with a TON of girls and we mobbed the counter with really specific orders.
The cashier was kind, attentive, answered our ridiculous "does this have...?" "does this come with...?" "yes but can I do that with this instead of that?" questions, and even let a couple of us change our orders after we made them.

Food was AWESOME, I got the 2 taco combo with pulled pork. It was surprisingly juicy, and I literally moaned when I took my first bite. SO good, I felt so healthy after, and they even let us pull together 6 tables.

Great Baja Fresh. I'll go here any time I'm in the area. For sure.
