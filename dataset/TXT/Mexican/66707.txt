Bf2fuqWbHd3L-X69FSMvmg We've come here at least once a month for the past eight months, so I can claim to know a few things about El Trompo. 

Can I tell you if it's authentic? Nope. But the the tacos are consistently good and the quality of the ingredients is excellent -- fresh and yummy. The guacamole is stick-your-face-in-the-bowl delicious, and the service is fast and super pleasant. We'll keep coming back over and over.
