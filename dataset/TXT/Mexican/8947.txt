_u1Bq7QsgMUXSMex8QHqLQ As an outsider and someone who loves Mexican food I was thrilled to try this place. However I was not impressed at all and to be somewhat honest in the four days in Toronto I had better Mexican food. Perhaps it was the nacho's and that is what I got. I was disappointed I paid for guacamole and they didn't give it to me. It was crowded so clearly I went in the wrong direction on choices.
