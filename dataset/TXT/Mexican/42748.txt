78hGCrQ6wLA2yh8zMywnmw I've been eating at Wahoo's for 6 years. I love the two bartenders they are so kind. Brian and Floody make the place feel like Cheers... Always a smile and great service. I don't think I would eat there as much as I do if it weren't for them and the wonderful kitchen staff especially Julie. The food is always great and I'm a picky eater
