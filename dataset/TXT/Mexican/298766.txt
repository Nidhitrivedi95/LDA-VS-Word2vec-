zJGtD3y-pAIGNId4codEEg We used to really love Otro Cafe, but it's been steadily declining and after our last visit, it's unlikely that we'll go back anytime soon.  The service was absolutely awful.  We waited as several servers passed us by and I had to ask to order my son's food and all of our drinks.  We waited again and had to flag someone down to order.  Our drinks and food took an excessive amount of time to arrive, and something came out with an error.  The manager held a staff meeting during the breakfast rush, and we watched as an entire staff of folks gathered by the hostess stand while we were waiting for our food with empty drinks.  Not once did a manager visit our table.  It was a very disappointing experience to say the least, and sadly I will not be recommending Otro Cafe anymore.
