qWi9dNGo9D9I4F9RANc-6g We went there last night for the first time. Won't be back for sure. First mexican restaurant I had to pay for the salsa. Which wasn't very good at all. The menu was rediculous to read. The service was terrible, had to ask 3 times for partially stale chip refills while we waited over an hour for food. Our bartender/server was overwhelmed. Not sure why we had to ask someone to help her out with our table of 9. Needless to say i will stick with my local mexican restaraunts from now on
