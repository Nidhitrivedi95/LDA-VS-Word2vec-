333W59XcrXZsJlnBAAx5mQ The food is just as awesome as it ever was but there is a problem with an old school waitress. She was no fun at the old place and it continues today. I'm kind of recognizable so she probably has it out for me. Tonight I signed my bill with a note, I wrote, "Poor service equals poor tip, please apologize to the bussing staff". I felt terrible stiffing the kids but I felt I needed to express how I perceived her service. The other servers were working like rock stars and showing attention to each and every table. 
To be true to the guidelines I will not mention names but many long time visitors probably know who I am talking about. It wasn't the half bowl of chips she started with or not noticing my tasty Michelada was empty when the food came and never dropped by to see if I might like another for the next 30 minutes. The next time we saw her was when we finished our meal and had to call out to get her attention for a check.
I should have written, "Poor hospitality equals poor tip". When she brought out our food I asked her how the seafood place was doing that moved into their old location. She replied smartly that "She doesn't go that far south", making me instantly feel that she just disrespected the entire neighborhood that I have enjoyed for over 50 years. I know she has gone that far south, she worked there for years. I had no idea that moving 3 and a half miles would change people so much. Not a lot of love tonight, via con dios amigos... I can name a half dozen competitors that love my business and sell Tecate.
