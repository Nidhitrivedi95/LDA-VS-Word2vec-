K_sbl7yJnDE-zqkGB7NxeA Like I said in previous posts- Iove me some burritos! We stumbled upon this place while passing it numerous times. What drew my fiancée to this place is the fact they advertised Jerk Chicken. Can you say yum?!

I'm glad to say we finally did. The decor is cute. They have humorous signs up on the one wall. The seating is very limited. It gives me the impression it's more of a take out joint. 

On to the food! We ordered regular burritos. A buffalo chicken and jerk chicken. They were yummy and good but we both found they were very saucy at times. Flavour of the Buffalo was good and had a nice spice touch. However, I found the sauce got old in terms of flavour real quick. 

4 out of 5 stars- too much sauce but still delicious!
