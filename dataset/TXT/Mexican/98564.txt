EP1do6l8hLyIGEru0gN3EQ I enjoyed this very much! My food was filling and delicious. I got the Steak Quesidilla Big Plate, with a side of the veg of the day, Which was fresh corn with basil and something, and it was all good. I didn't manage to eat it all, and the leftover Quesidilla and beans were tasty cold 2 days later.

My friend got the "margarita of the Day" and that was delish too, though I don't remember what it was, I think watermelon something.
