XpyYSWF-8xi_aZ67RUuk2Q We went there today for an early dinner. They gave us a nice seat in the dining room even though the bar and outside were the choices. 
    My wife had the veggie enchilada dinner and I the beef enchiladas. Both were delicious. Not the usual fair of most Mexican eateries. Mine was very flavorful and my wife agreed that hers was also. 
     Our waitress Wendy was very attentive and personable!
       We will definitely come back!
