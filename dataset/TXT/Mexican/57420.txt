a8pmtlVKf7NiSLI-4KejIw I had never been to El Catrin before but went in a party of 8. As the tapas portions are rather scant and getting what you like is quite difficult. The atmosphere and service is good. The place was buzzing all night. The problem is that I went away hungry and one other attendee suggested going to McDonald's after which was partially accurate as it was $422 plus $84 for gratuity and still steep for a little food. I have been to Mexico and the decor and atmosphere was very accurate to something in Acapulco or Mazatlan .   He Ceviche de Verde for $13.95 was three mouthfuls and not as nice as I had hoped. I think a party of two would fare better having what they wanted. Big groups seem to end up being hungry . I would try it again, but not line up as the crowds were big to get in.
