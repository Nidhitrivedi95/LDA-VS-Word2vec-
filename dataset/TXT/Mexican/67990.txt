BHMqFvtguSDrZLQPtjZSuA For being a fast food Mexican restaurant, the food here was surprisingly good and was better than expected. I have been here a few times before and I liked their chicken tacos which also comes with rice and beans. Overall the meal was great with the chicken tacos being tasty. The prices for the food are very reasonable and they're also open late night and have a drive-thru, so it's a very convenient option if you're in the south Scottsdale area.
