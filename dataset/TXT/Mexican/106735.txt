FMo1PJTUV5OpyiZlnTM1Rg We have eaten at Sharkey's three times now--love it!  Quick order at the counter, lots of organic and healthful choices, free salsa bar and complimentary chips, friendly staff, nice atmosphere inside plus outdoor eating as well. My favorite is the half shrimp power plate with two sides of grilled veggies--no idea how I could eat the full sized one!  The fajita tacos my grandson had looked great!
