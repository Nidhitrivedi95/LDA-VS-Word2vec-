ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA We heard about Ocotillo from the 2016 Best New Restaurants in Phoenix Magazine and wanted to try it out for our anniversary weekend. The ambiance is great with the wood burning fire pits as you walk in from the back parking lot. We asked to be seated outside as it was less noisy on the patio. Our waitperson was very knowledgeable about the menu, but wasn't as attentive to our table, there were long waits for our drink order and our bill. The food was delicious. We had to have the cauliflower for a starter since supposedly that is their signature item on the menu. We also had the crispy chicken meatballs, wood fired beef ribs, and grilled ginger steak. We were not disappointed with any of our choices. The beef ribs were meaty, plentiful, and falling off the bone. The mole BBQ sauce was especially pleasing. The steak was cooked to perfection and the ginger sauce was just right. We would definitely come here again, but sit inside to get better service.
