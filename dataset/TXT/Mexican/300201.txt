zMfZLd5_h5W8ZVxTNoeJyQ I'm biased because I am from California (San Jose, CA specifically) where we have sooooo many amazing authentic Mexican (and not only Mexican but Salvadorean, Peruvian, etc.) restaurants around me.. So I understand that I am super lucky and privileged to have quite the selection. 

I came here for dinner on a Saturday night - took a cab from Oakland but it's walking distance. We were seated immediately by the host and our server promptly greeted us. She gave us extra time to look through both the drink and food menus then came to take our orders. We ordered: 

Drinks (the drinks were my favorite part of this place, sooooo good!)
-Cactus Caribbean Hurricane (spiced rum, coconut rum, OJ & pineapple juice)
-Steel Cactus Mojito
-Patron Select Blood Orange Margarita

Food
-Camarones De Chili Lima
-Cactus Molcajete Bowl (mix of carne asada, chicken, jalapenos, shrimp served in a HUGE heated bowl along with lots of sides like salsa, black beans, etc.)
-Carnitas Enchiladas (DO NOT order these, they were not good at all. Dry and not tasty.)

Anyway, I give the service 5 stars, the food 2 stars and the overall atmosphere/vibe/interior 4 stars. Altogether, 3.6 stars. :)
