Kj8rXSpMQlFOP2iWN0fXYA Anayas is one of the best Mexican restaurants I've eaten at.  Their salsa is wonderful.   I usually don't do too spicy, but where this salsa is concerned, I  can't stop eating it.  The staff is friendly and helpful and the food is excellent.  I especially like their red child tamale.  I've already recommended Anayas to family members and a friend.   If you're looking for good Mexican food, I recommend Anayas.
