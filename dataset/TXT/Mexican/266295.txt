WfB_SsYeKy83QQsqAAyGVQ There are no cooks in this restaurant you get a actual chef to make your fresh cut meat and fresh deep fried chips , and delicious salsa !! Got to say that everything was so good the flavor of the rice and the beans were so good !! Big plates and great costumer service!!! You must go to this place don't let the location fool you it's worth it and affordable.
