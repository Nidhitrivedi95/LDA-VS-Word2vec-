BgQ5ob0QiZfO5YbgI7VyFw The building is uninviting.  If it wasn't for a business dinner, I would not eat here.  I got carne adovada with green chile. It was a little overcooked and flavorless.  However service was excellent.  Perhaps it's because we brought 35 people on a Tuesday night.  The guacamole was missing something - garlic and jalapeño?  My coworker found four inches of hair in her stuffed chicken.  They replaced her dish within minutes.  I work with respectful folks so no one said anything bad about the food but no one said anything good about the food.  A few plates were empty so you can interpret that however you want.  I don't live in AZ so I can only speak of this experience.
