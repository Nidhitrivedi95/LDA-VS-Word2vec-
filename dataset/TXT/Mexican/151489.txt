Service was meah- server seemed angry and impatient.
I had the pork carnita grilled cheese- idea is great! Problem is when biting into it oil literally poured out the bottom. Lost its appeal quickly.
Friend had the divorced poached eggs- said they were flavourless
Friend had the waffles- advised they tasted like they were frozen.
 Sad really- place came highly recommended by friends who had been thought it was great. However- prob won't be going back. Not sure what the big deal
Is.
