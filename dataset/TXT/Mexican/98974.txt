Es-MfCr79uHI-CSrzkea-w My only complaint about this place is that it doesn't marinade either the chicken or the steak for the fajitas. If it was marinated in lemon and lime juice and garlic etc. with just a little salt, the flavor would be so fantastic and also the meat would be more tender. Every time I go in there's a huge problem with how hard and tough the protein is. Please start marinating your protein. Thank you!
