yydyoWCY3LJYlPwVLKbJ3Q Haha! What is this place? Ordered the ceviche and it's not ceviche. Ordered a margarita and it was like Kool aid. Got the bill and it was twice as much as I'd expect for Mexican food. Waiter was on his game but felt bad for him because it was like he knew the place was not good. This place may be good to watch a game but that's it.
