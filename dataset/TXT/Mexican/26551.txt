3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ Decided to try this place out due to the awesome decor but was sadly disappointed. Coming from a restaurant background I know what to expect and what is incorrect. To start off my boyfriend and I were greeted with an unfriendly guy who looked like he was more than ready to leave for the night. he brought us our drinks then disappeared for quite some time. By the time he came around to ask for an appetizer order we were already losing patience. The food took forever to hit the table. The food was mediocre and the service didn't help. We had to ask several different people to fill our waters and were only checked on once which was when we asked for the check. I had high hopes for this place but simply left with leaving a note on the check saying "service needs a lot of work, step it up." Won't be going back.
