oq8qksFNfHVyQwcZsQIN8A This place is brand new. Kind of like don't judge a book by its cover situation. The food is on point. I had a the fish tacos it was spicy and very flavorful. The green salsa is very fresh and so authentic, they should sell it in bulk. Try the black beans. I came to this place on a whim and so glad I did.
