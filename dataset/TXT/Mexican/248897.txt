ucJ17aXhHoIYmHrneOLI-A Newly opened here. The menu is chock full of items to choose. Large portions..we are stuffed!! The wait staff (Adrian) was very attentive, friendly and oh, yeah and  attentive.  When considering that they have not been open very long, we are quite impressed. Good luck and keep up the good work!
