1HfkEkNhI6XJXkgrCTBKpw Was very excited to check this place out this weekend. I was with a group of 6 people (4 males and 2 females). The bar was not crowded at all, and as we attempted to enter the bar the bouncer allowed the female members of our group into the bar with no questions asked. When the males attempted to enter the bouncer informed us that "he could only allow two more males in due to fire code". 

I would understand his concern if the bar was at capacity or if the gender had not been mentioned, but last time i checked Pennsylvania fire code does not set gender limits.

Extremely disappointed and will not be returning.
