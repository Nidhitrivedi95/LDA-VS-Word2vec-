7D-ATDP9Ezr1ZehszsotOQ This place is hit or miss. The food is generally good, but recently has been so inconsistent. We ordered guacamole for the chips that came out with our dinner. I ordered a combo with a taco, enchilada and tamale. There was no meat (none) in my taco. The server also forgot the beans. Service is satisfactory. Our waters were empty until we asked for them to be filled. The WORST part about this experience is that it smelled like urine in the restaurant, except for the bar area. It was horrible. Shame on me, it has smelled like urine 3 of the last 5 times we have dined in. We should have known better. I think so we can go back after so many failed chances.
