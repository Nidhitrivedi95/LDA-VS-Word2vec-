g9vzFlunYXagaH5hNkU2Uw I really used to like this place but we were very surprised tonight when we both ordered full meals, and my friend ordered another meal to go in addition to her meal.  They CHARGED a surcharge for take out.  

When she questioned the manager he got rather rude and told her that the take out containers cost him money.  He then called her "sweetheart" in a condescending way.

Who charges a surcharge for containers for take out?  And if they do, they need to put it clearly onto their menu!  There was no mention of any additional charge for take out!

We will not return.
