g-E12y45gBKedax5N20YmQ First burrito and taco spot we've been to in CLT. They offer a Cali menu of options, that gave us the excitement to go since I grew up in CA, been in TX. So hubby and I wanted to check it. We are always on the hunt for amazing food. Ordered the Cali burrito which was good, steak taco and fish tacos which weren't so great, just wish they weren't frozen. I'll stick to the steak. 
May return if we're in the area and feel like having tacos and burritos. Service was ok.
