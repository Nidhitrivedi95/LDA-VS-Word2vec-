Had a great friendly server and not so good hostess (4.5/5) for service
My husband and I both agree that the food was just alright. (3/5)
We ordered the guacamole sampler of 3 different flavors for 18.50. The guacamole was a best part of the meal.
We also ordered a wild boar tamale and beef brisket taquitos. Not impressed and not worth the price. Had much better tamale and taquitos for half the price!
