Kj8rXSpMQlFOP2iWN0fXYA Very very good. Fun decor, and clean inside. Staff was friendly. The food was delicious. I had "Dos Amigos".
(shrimp, scallops, and mushrooms in red sauce)
It really hit the spot. I will definitely be going back.
I highly recommend this place when you get a hankerin for mexican food.
