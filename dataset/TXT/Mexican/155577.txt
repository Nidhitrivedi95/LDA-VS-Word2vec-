k9b96JXlNewj36ddrce9Jw Let me start by saying, if I could give this place 20 stars, I would.  I bartended a special event downtown, and they were a vendor there.  I'm a vegetarian so this was really the only place that had anything I could eat.  It was a 3 day event, and thankfully I ate there the first day, so I could go back the other 2.  The food is out of this world, with so many different flavors and ingredients that vegetarians/vegans aren't used to experiencing at a "normal" food establishment.  Food is VERY fresh and unique.  I tried most of the menu, don't ask me to give my favorite because that's an IMPOSSIBLE question that doesn't have an answer.  I have no clue why they don't have a restaurant so we can have access to their food all the time!!  I really wish they would!!
