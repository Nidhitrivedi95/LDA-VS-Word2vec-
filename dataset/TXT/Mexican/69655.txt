br2M2b-CsXI0HY0RXvHl0w Our team at work continues to go out for lunch every Friday. This week, we headed over to El Sombrero.

It was the second week that we went to a Mexican eatery. My manager used a random generator to determine which restaurant we go to each week. Because we were doing Mexican again, only three of us said yes to going out.

I drove my colleague and manager over to the restaurant. It's in a fairly quiet strip mall. Getting there was fairly straightforward. I drove along Matheson Boulevard, and then turned north along Hurontario. I then turned onto Brunel Road and was there.

We got there at noon. It was busy. We lined up, with my reserving a table for us with my coat and hat. My colleague placed his scarf down on the table.

I had the enchiladas. I got to choose the type of meat and went with chicken. You get chunks of chicken. The lunch comes with black beans and rice. It was so filling and tasty. I think that the sodium could have been reduced and the beans didn't need feta cheese. The enchiladas were smothers in shredded cheese. The food was delicious.

My manager had the lentil soup and soft fish tacos. I love fish tacos that are grilled and are not fried in some batter. They looked good. The fish appeared to be salmon. He enjoyed his food.

My colleague got the Mex burger. I love burgers with guacamole. He liked his burger. He also let us have some of his fries. I normally don't like fries, but they were good. 

This restaurant is a nice family-run business. Everyone taking our orders and getting our food to us were helpful, hard-working, and friendly.

The restaurant is fairly small. There is a bar area. In the summertime, I am sure that there are more places to sit when the patio is open.

I will come back to sample more dishes. Perhaps I will do takeout one evening.
