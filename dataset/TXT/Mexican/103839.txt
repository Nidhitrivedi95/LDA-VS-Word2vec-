fbQaKW0Lte0JQ_opbnjdKg I have always enjoyed coming here. The last time I was at this establishment it was not so good of an experience. I tried to order the nachos, I noticed their chips (which are homemade there in house) had salt. I have a condition called Meniere's, if I consume too much salt it can send me into extreme vertigo. When I questioned about the salted chips the gal with the blue/purple hair said, "Well, everything else has salt in it." That's all she had to offer. And she wasn't nice about it. I thought maybe, just maybe, they could fry up a fresh batch of unsalted corn tortillas to make unsalted chips. I was sorely mistaken. I can go to any establishment that makes fresh and request unsalted chips and most often they are happy to accommodate. I was terribly disappointed because the food is otherwise very good. I did try to contact the owner to discuss this issue and that was over a week ago. I have yet to hear back from him. Thanks for showing care and compassion Mr. Poole.
