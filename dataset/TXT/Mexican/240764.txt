Tc1ly-0VLk3AaoMb7CrlVA I'm making this quick and straight to the point...

1. Don't place an online order. Your food won't be ready when you arrive. 

2. The service is shitty. I stood at the window for about 3 minutes without being acknowledged by anyone even though there were two living human beings that I made eye contact with.

Keep in mind,  I was there to pick up my order I placed on Yelp because I was on a time restricted lunch break. I had to sit and wait for them to make my food when it SHOULD'VE ALREADY BEEN DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

3. I ordered the steak tacos. They were ok but the meat was greasy and like others mentioned the portions are small. I ordered salsa ON the tacos,guess what? NO SALSA so my tacos were DRY as Death Valley. How do you make a dry taco? 

4. Oh yea, the pico isn't that great either....

Pass on this place and go somewhere else.
