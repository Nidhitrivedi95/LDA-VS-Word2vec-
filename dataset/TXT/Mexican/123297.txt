hisaMvsxMzo08xigPIwXiA So I can't speak to the lobster or higher ticket items as I've only had the fish tacos.. But seriously Madison.. Best fish tacos EVER! So good and unique that every time I come here I have no desire to order anything else. The taco consists of small little pieces of fish with the usual assortment of onions, cilantro, tomatoes and cheese mixed in between a corn tortilla... But the holy shit moment is their own sweet aioli concoction that you put on the taco! It's everything you could want but never had imagined. Eat it!
