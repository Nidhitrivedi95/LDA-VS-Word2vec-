gLIXqQDeNjW4CR7x58orrw We went here for the first time today and won't be back. We've been to other locations and typically have a great experience. Not this location!

It was very messy when we walked in, as if they hadn't cleaned from the lunch rush. We ordered and the first employee seemed very disinterested, and I could barely hear her. I had to ask her to repeat herself several times. I finally leaned over the sneeze guard as much as I could. 

We ordered vegetarian tacos. Usually the first line employee does something, but this time we were passed on to the 2nd employee. She was honestly the only employee who seemed to have any interest in her job. 

When it was time to pay, I told the cashier that I had a free meal on the rewards card. I had already seen signs that stated the new rewards program on the app. But I had still purchased 10 entrees and earned a free one. When I told the cashier, she said "oh we don't do that anymore, now it's the app". I told her I understood, but I had still earned a free meal. She wouldn't honor it and I requested a manager. The manager took care of it, no problem. I don't understand why the previous cashier made it more difficult than it had to be.

The food tasted fine. However my spouse and I both got sick shortly after we finished our meal. 

Maybe I should have seen that coming. When we used the restaurant bathroom, it was very dirty. This store needs some serious help.
