vFylbmcjMRaVxYeDZhnGyw I love this OTB.  The staff is always friendly, the food is good, and the place is clean...even the bathrooms.  Good value for the money.  And the gentleman who serves the food and sings is always a treat!  He's a hoot!  Friendly, nice people make an establishment even better.  If someone wants "real" Mexico City food, then go to Mexico City!  For me, it's the OTB!!  Love it!
