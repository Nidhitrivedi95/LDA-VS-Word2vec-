XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg We ate at Mesa Grill last Saturday and it was great!  I loved the food, service and decor (southwest).  I had the NY steak & my wife had the lamb (the side tamale was the best we've ever had).  My steak was PERFECT!!  I rarely eat beef, and when I do I want the best.  This steak did not disappoint.  It was cooked perfectly and was a perfect cut of meat, and the sauce was the best I've ever had.  The service was very attentive, without being overbearing.  The waitress or busboy seemed to appear out of nowhere to clear plates or check on us.  We'll come back for sure!
