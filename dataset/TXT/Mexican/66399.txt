BEplfZTUzYwApjMUaOA12w I came here for breakfast around 8:30 while the rest of Vegas was mostly still asleep. The service was polite, prompt and attentive. I got seated at a table next to the canal and had a great view. 

I had the breakfast burrito which came out within ten minutes of ordering and was decent. The portion was generous, it was a good mix of rice, potatoes, beans, egg and condiments. Then it was stopped with salsa like a wet burrito.

Four starts because the food wasn't amazing but it was good but the service was solid.
