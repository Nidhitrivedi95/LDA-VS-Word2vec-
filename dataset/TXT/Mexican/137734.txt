ITRBrOOVQJEgc5dbxV1Bbw I really love this little spot over here in Tolleson. It's pretty darn good mexican fast food. My very favorite is the pastor burrito with added beans. Oh my goodness it's so delish! My kids & I also love the mini tacos of carne asada, pastor and carnitas (on Monday and Tuesday's these have a  good special on these!).. all three meats are seasoned well. Another added bonus they have a condiment center with freshly chopped cucumbers, limes, pico de gallo and salsa. I would definitely recommend if you're near by!
