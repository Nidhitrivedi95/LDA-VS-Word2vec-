1Nq7GxjvEDgAJxBeOjR_9Q We were regulars up to this point. Very disappointed. We called at 6:13 pm to place an order. We were told we would receive a call back for payment. At this point we were given no information on our order. We called at 6:40pm to check on the order and spoke to Oscar. He said he was very busy and our order was being cooked. After a short conversation I was under the impression he was to busy for my business. When I requested cancelling the order he hung up on me. I called back and requested the owners name. Jackie was the name I was given. He said I spoke down to him. At no time did I complain cuss or yell at Oscar.  I asked him what he needed from me to complete the order. I do not feel my response due to the lack of communication on his part warranted a dial tone. I would never hang up on a customer. I will be calling the owner. With this kind of customer service I recommend going elsewhere. We will be crossing them off our list for delivery. I suggest a refresher for Oscar concerning customer relations.  I hear Filibertos is a great place to eat.
