_H4GXECi4nHfJTz4dsQV_w I initially wanted to check out Rita's because I happened to see the low prices and I was intrigued. I went in with fresh eyes and luckily there was no one there so I had time to get a feel for the place. I got a breakfast burrito and it was great! Today, I went there and the line was out the door. Rather than waiting, I decided to call my order in since that what they are best for (per their news interview). I called them numerous times, but there was no answer. I don't think leaving a voicemail would do me justice. So I went to Señor Taco. Sad day.
