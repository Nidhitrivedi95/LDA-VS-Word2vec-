My margarita was awesome, even though they made it without the Agave syrup, as requested.  It packed a punch!  Thank you!  And my chimichanga was sooooo good!  I think I heard angels singing instead of the mariachi band?   I am a green sauce person, my guest is a red sauce person.  So, we ordered our usuals, green sauce chimichanga for me and a red sauce wet burrito for him!  After our food arrived,  we did our typical food swap.....  To my surprise,  even though I loved my green chimichanga in front of me,  I loved the red even more!  He loved MY green sauce more than his red!  Sauce so good it made us change teams!  Sauce teams that is! . What a beautiful food experience!  Can't wait to go back and try more menu items!
