This is authentic Mexican as opposed to the usual tex-mex that everyone other place in the downtown vicinity offers and it makes for a wonderful addition to the downtown food scene.  I had the carnitas, which were one of the special offerings of the night, and while I'm not used to having carnitas shredded they were cooked perfectly and everyone at my table loved them.  It's the type of spot that deserves to be frequented and as busy as it got in there I don't think they'll be a long-lasting establishment.
