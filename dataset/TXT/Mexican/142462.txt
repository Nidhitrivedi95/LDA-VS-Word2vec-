Walking in it smelt like they just got done burning the rice (good thing I wasnt there for rice). I ordered a carne asada burrito and a green Chile burrito. These things are 5 bucks each and are flippin tiny. They should call these tortilla and green Chile burrito because there is so much tortilla to meat combo... I tried the carne asada first and it was decent. It was a tad salty but the problem is the tortilla is thin and wraps around the meat like 3 times its so Damn big. I next tried the green chile... Instead of throwing it across the parking lot and yelling at the skies with fury and anger, I gave it to the human garbage disposal sitting next to me in my truck (coworker). It was slimy with bits of meat and had absolutely no flavor. I would have rather had a certain fast food restaurant burrito that usually you get after drinking. Well, I gave it another shot and it failed miserably. I wouldnt ever spend another dime there.
