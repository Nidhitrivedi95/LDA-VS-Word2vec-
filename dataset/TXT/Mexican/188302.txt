o6Yor6ofIw2TqM3mN28Kzg Finger licking good authentic Tex Mex with some added more authentic Latin cuisine like the Papusas. 

This place is good, cheap, too small and stuffy, never open on time, bare essential, great food, simple service, no washroom, hole in the wall type of place that you go to when you just want to stuff yourself with good cheap food regardless of the less than perfect atmosphere. 

Don't go here expecting perfectly clean fast service! Go here for grub a tub tub or better yet, call and get take away so you get the cheap good food without the crap atmosphere.
