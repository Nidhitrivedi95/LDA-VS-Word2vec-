gwd1W_0Mgzqo3QxgXrt16Q I would go back to this place purely for the ambiance and beautiful patio. Sat outside on a nice summer night (that for once wasn't too hot!) They have live music on Wednesdays which was nice but got to be a little too loud if you're having conversation at your table with more than one person. 

Service was very slow, we were there for almost two hours and waited probably 15 minutes each time we ordered drinks. It seems as if they had to go inside for the drinks each time even though there's a bar outside which seemed odd. 

We got the three amigos appetizer which included salsa, guacamole, and queso. The guac and queso were great, the salsa tasted like it came from a jar. I got two tacos, and they were just OK. Nothing compared to Paco's Tacos. Would not come back for the food, but definitely for a nice night on the patio.
