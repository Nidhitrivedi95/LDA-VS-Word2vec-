XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg There are very few places I will give five stars. I had the blue corn crusted halibut and the squash blossoms and both were absolutely amazing. I sat at the bar and the staff was very attentive and responsive even though she was by herself and it was busy.  I can't wait to get back to Vegas so I can eat here again.  Well worth the coin you will drop (by myself it was over $100).
