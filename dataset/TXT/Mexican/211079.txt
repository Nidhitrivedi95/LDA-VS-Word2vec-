qpWi9P3DEG-aIwT74Gh8Dg Support Local. Mike has done a great job at transforming this local spot from The Nosh to Urban Margarita. Vegetarian tacos were delicious. Black beans also great. $6 skinny and house margaritas. My husband ordered vegetarian fajitas that were tasty. Come support Mike and team. JT is still the infamous Friday night and Sunday morning bartender. #supportlocal
