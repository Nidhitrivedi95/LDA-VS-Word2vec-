xUvgrDdKhcmaP6Zv0ssb6A I've been meaning to write this review for quite a while. This place isn't "the best" Mexican food around if you're part of the Scottsdale crowd. IT IS affordable, consistent and always a great atmosphere!

I suggest going for happy hour. It's from 3-6 and includes a nice sample of food and drinks.

Outside of happy hour I prefer the 3 Amigos enchiladas. You can't go wrong with these flavors and that side of rice and beans. 

Don't forget to ask for the hot salsa!

Other favorites include the chicken cheese crisps, chicken taquitos and Mexican pizza.

This place is great and make sure to sit in the cantina.
