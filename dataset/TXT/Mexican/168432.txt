What makes me angry is the waitress not telling me I was being charged. Then I ordered the shrimp tacos ala cart because I didn't want rice and beans to my surprise when you order less food it costs three dollars more so be sure to get the plate and waste the rice and beans. I always worry this place will go out of business. It's such a cool dive bar with slow service and  they typical you should expect. Just sucks I have to leave one of south Scottsdale classic spots one star
