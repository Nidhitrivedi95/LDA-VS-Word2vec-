gEv1Og5uGDLw9HkbKSGUZw What a great time was had at El Caballito. The tequila was flowing at the Yelp party last month! The tasty, potent margaritas and flavourful chicken tacos were complimented perfectly by the very friendly and attentive staff. I truly enjoyed the underground atmosphere at El Caballito and will definitely be back to try some more of their menu items and may be easily convinced to try a few more margaritas.
