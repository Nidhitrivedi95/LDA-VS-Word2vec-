YCVAc-MG8--2An9erAo7NQ Only 1 star for this location.  

I love Chipotle... the quality of the food and taste is one of my favorite quick grab meals. 

This location is the worst... it's quality of service has gone down hill over the past couple of years that I've frequent it. Which is very disappointing!

Tonight I went to get something to eat with my two daughters. We ordered a salad and other items from the menu.... once again quality of food good... but when we went to get our drinks and utensils, no forks.... ok so they haven't restocked the supplies.... it happens so we ask at the counter for forks.... "we have no forks" the person replied. What??? Really you sell salad but don't have anything but a spoon to eat it???  You don't mention it to us when we order that maybe we should get a burrito instead of a salad??? About 15 minutes later lo and behold someone comes out with a huge box of forks!!!! The place was empty when we went and was just staring to get busy. 

How completely inconsiderate and uncaring for their clientele!!!

I repeat I love the brand but Chipotle really needs to up their employees especially at this location.
