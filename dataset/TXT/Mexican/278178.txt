xLy3aWEbtpoUSVdjuHBS0A This place is hit or miss.  The burritos are amazing.   The salad I had the last visit was just ok.    Service can be hit or miss as well. 

We do like their food a lot and would return.   I would just order the burritos!  Also,  I would definitely say the table side guacomole is a must! You can request mild, medium or spicy.  The spicy wasn't too spicy but it had the perfect amount of kick.    Hands down the best guacamole we ever had...
