9Bg2JLQdyf97KlNuRQ56HA Boy have they raised their prices...now $3 for a tamale that is a tad longer than middle finger...red sauce barely warm...was $1.60.. carne asada quesadilla was $4.90 now $6.50...was cut in thirds and one piece only had two bites with filling...prior visit was breakfast burrito...they cut back on filling as had few bites to get to filling....have never had problem with order or service....but visits will be less..they do have great red hot sauce...
