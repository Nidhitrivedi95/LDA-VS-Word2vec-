SW6ZQk22G1_CV81_gfnvNQ I've been going to La Carnita for a few years now. A go-to spot when I want a place with good music, cool vibes, and pollo (chicken) tacos that everyone consistently loves. Fantastic hot sauce (this is a big deal to me). I also ALWAYS order dessert.

Solid service. Fast, attentive, detail-oriented but not overbearing. 

I'd go a bit earlier if you want some quiet(er) conversations. I personally like the busy and loud atmosphere. Love the booths in the back room for larger groups and the smaller tables across the kitchen.
