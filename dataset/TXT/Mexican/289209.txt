YKGTLE-Q9nQl7M1NwLvFZg My first time trying this location, but I've long been a fan of the Oakville locations. It was taco Tuesday today ($5 tacos), so of course I got an order of steak tacos. 

The steak is freshly grilled for your tacos and it was a nicely cooked medium. You get to choose two freshly made salsas and I usually go with the pineapple salsa and the salsa fresca (essentially a pico de gallo). I never get cheese or sourcream and I usually omit the lettuce. At most places this would leave you with a very skimpy taco, but here that's not the case. The two salsas, abundant steak, jalapenos, and cilantro filled my tortillas quite nicely.
