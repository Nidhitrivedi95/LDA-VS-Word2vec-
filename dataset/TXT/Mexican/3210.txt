-o082vExIs0VVNSuZmiTQA Terrible customer service and obviously management issues. Website, yelp, Google says closes at 10PM on Sunday. We arrived at 8:45 to be told were slow so the kitchen closed. Then told we can get your food in but we're closed. So, no relaxing, enjoying and eating. I guess always call before arriving.....? Terrible management. Change your advertising if you "close early when slow." Will never recommend or try again.
