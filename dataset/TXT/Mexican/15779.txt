Burritos: 
Three weeks ago I ordered a carne asada burrito. Excellent quality meat, a great marinade and a good sized burrito for about one dollar more than the cheap hole in the walls charge. The ingredients set it above and beyond all other places I've tried, which is about 12-13 other places (I was searching for my go-to place). 

Two weeks ago I had a carnitas burrito, double meat. Excellent and didn't skimp on the extra meat. The carnitas were still the best I'd had in town, but not ever. The carne asada was on par with the best carne asada i've ever had, though.

Came in today and got a double meat carne asada burrito. Again, perfect, large. Inspired me to finally write this review.

Salsa:
The red salsa is not spicy, but has a lot of flavor. If I recall my first time here, there are actually two reds and one green. The green was alright, but I am biased because verde has never been my thing. One red was darker than the other I believe. None were spicy. That would be my only criticism of this place. There should be a hot hot red option.

Customer service: 
Excellent. I have placed orders via phone twice. Once I called, and nobody picked up, so that was a bummer. But, they promptly picked up this time. When inside, the owner was genuinely nice and excited about his product. He remembered me three weeks later. It really doesn't feel like a Mexican food place because everyone is nice, attentive and everything is spotless. 

A restaurant has to be either incredibly good or incredibly bad for me to leave a review, even though I yelp every restaurant I go to. This earned a review. Check this place out.
