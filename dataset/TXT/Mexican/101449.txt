EUxbuNT8BYPs_h0vVMy2pg This restaurant was a fabulous find for authentic Mexican food. You place your order at the counter, the chips and salsa are brought to your table, and they're amazing, and when the food is brought to your table it's delicious! This is a small restaurant in a strip mall with a friendly staff, and good service.
