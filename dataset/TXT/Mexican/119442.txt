gtffarZ2Y_rLfCegMg-nqw 3 Stars for inconsistent service has always forgetting the Salad dressing. This chipotle is located inside the Fashion Show Mall. It's really convenient if you park in the "green" parking garage and take the escalator up which leads you right in front of them. I dine at this chipotle at least once a week and the services in very inconsistent. I almost never get my salad dressing. I have to make sure I remind them at the end every single time. Since I take it to go, it becomes very disappointing to get back to my office and realized there is no dressing. They're also inconsistent with the veggie option. Guacamole comes with the veggie option as meat at no extra charge but sometime they charge me extra. The service as far as the friendly faces preparing the food is great, they're all very kind. Even through the hard orders struggling to explaining to tourist foreigners they remain friendly and helpful.
