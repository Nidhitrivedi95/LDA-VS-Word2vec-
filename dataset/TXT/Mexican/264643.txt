Wc9UpJhOcdSj7olZkz7SJA Mixed feelings on The Stand right now. We have been loyal Stand customers since they opened. The burgers and fries are typically amazing and so are the shakes. I love the salted caramel! 

My husband and I got off work late last Friday night and decided to pick up some food around 10pm (I think they close at 11pm). We got it home and it was  absolutely horrible. The fries were tiny little soggy, greasy pieces and the burgers did not taste fresh either. The whole meal was very unappetizing and at $20 for two burgers and fries majorly disappointing. We wrote it off as a fluke since it was late, although we have gotten delicious food there late at night many other occasions.

We went again today and although the burgers were close to normal, the fries were absolutely horrible again. They were all brown, greasy, over cooked, soggy, and barely edible. 

We are small business owners ourselves and have been going to The Stand for about 2 years with no issues, so we were really trying to give it the benefit of the doubt. My husband called and let them know about our recent experiences. The employee who answered did not seem concerned. We asked if anything had changed about the fries, is there something we need to mention when we order to not get old, greasy fries? And return to the normally delicious, crispy, well seasoned ones? The employee said that they just have bad potatoes right now and there's nothing they can do to change the current quality of the fries. Bad potatoes?? For a place that prides itself on fresh ingredients I'm not understanding how a subpar quality of potato would be used for over a week. Moreover, I don't know how the quality of the potato could be affecting the amount of grease and lack of freshness of said fries.

Sadly, we will not be returning for awhile...
