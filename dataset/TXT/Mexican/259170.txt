VO-p1uczeMbzH8bEAv-RgA I would definitely say go with the Abondigas soup, or the Menudo! It always hit the spot no matter what time of day, it's also a really good hangover remedy. I would say avoid the Sonaran Enchilada only based on the fact that the sauce was bland, I come from a Hispanic family so I know when something is supposed to have a great flavor, and the Enchilada was not of them. The next thing I will complain about is that I ordered a breakfast burrito. I had no idea that the Chorizo was going to cost me an extra $5 dollars to add on to it. The egg was cooked like an omelette, and was not scrambled, and then the chorizo was spread across the burrito. So not only was it underwhelming but it was also bland. One last redeeming quality of this place is that they had a good happy hour.
