rANNcpPvv9EezHF-6kYCMg After you accept the concept of tapas - which was new to me, this is a nice place to come and have a great time and enjoy good food.  To extend the evening, think about ordering a small plate per person....drink some wine and then order another round of food....or two.  If you don't, your evening might be over before you are ready!  Unfortunately, the taco special was no longer available by the time we got there - but the brisket taco was a more than adequate substitute.  Our table of two ended up ordering 4 small plates and we enjoyed them all.  In addition, our waitress was A+.  Will definitely return.
