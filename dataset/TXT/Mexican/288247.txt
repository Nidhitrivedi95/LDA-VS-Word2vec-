Yevhl8bTwdJuu_LWKv-4Fw I held my company Christmas luncheon at Paladar on 12/20/15. Our group consists of vegans, vegetarians, pescatarians, and carnivours.  So, Palardar was the perfect place.  I am so happy that they were able to accommodate our group!

It was wonderful!  14 Adults and 7 children.  Paladar seated our group in a private section of the restaurant.    Chris was our server, and he is absolutely one of the best ever!  He was attentive, courteous, patient, and  knowledgeable.  With four little people running around, I don't know how he served us with such grace! 

Michael helped us plan the event.  It was a joy to work with him. 

Thanks to all of the Paladar associates that had a hand in providing us with a great dining experience. 

If you ever have the opportunity to host an event, or just looking for a great place to eat, definitely give Paladar a try!
