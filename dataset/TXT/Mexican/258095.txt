vjhB95c5nOXflNoyq_jKzw Best service ever. Walking in it was very busy and I didn't expect the service to be that great, but my hostess (I think her name was Rita) was spectacular. She did her best to get us a table promptly and brightened my day with her smile and wonderful attitude. The food was delicious also. I got the spinach florentine nachos, which were incredible. Overall, I highly recommend.
