8KEB1lcjKlIVSd6uA8JB9w I have to say Cafe Rio makes pretty good food to me I like it I rather eat there then Chipotle and get sick. The price of the food is not worth it if they lowered the menu by a few dollars at least make it feel like I'm not getting ripped off and nickel and dimed. They need to give bigger portions as far as meat sour cream and guacamole.
