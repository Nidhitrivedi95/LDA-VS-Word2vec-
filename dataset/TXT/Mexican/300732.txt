ZO3ihx5FOObI_uCgin4x8w The 1 star is strictly for the food I ordered while visiting this On The Border "Mexican" restaurant. I ordered the steak fajitas double refried beans no Spanish rice. I got my food and was instantly disappointed when my server placed it in front of me. The steak had no grill marks and looked sad af. Assembled my fajita using the measly portion of pico de Gallo, guacamole and sour cream that comes with the "fajitas" Took a bite and set it back down in my plate. I was waiting to get taken back from all the flavors I put in the flour tortilla but instead I got nothing. I don't think the meat was seasoned with salt even. It was so underwhelming and not worth the $17 and change they charge for it. I'll stick to my original place next time I'm craving fajitas
