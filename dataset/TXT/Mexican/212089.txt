qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A This place is too trendy for its own good! My party of four walked in d w bistro around 12:30 hoping to indulge in the bottomless mimosas and a fulfilling brunch. We were quoted a 45 minute wait time & told by the host that we could start at the bar and as long as we had our glasses at the table they would refill them all day. The four of us retreated to the bar where we fought to get attention from the bartenders for a solid 15 minutes. Once we got the attention of a bartender we were told that they were no longer selling mimosas. Another guest commented that they heard the bar was out of glasses so we continued to wait for other tables with glasses to leave. We then tried reordering mimosas and were told that they were no longer selling them as it was after 1- even though a bartender had just given a new glass to a guest that he appeared to know.  We went back to the host stand to clear up the confusion as we had already been waiting for 30 minutes hoping to get a drink. The host then checked back with the bartenders who told her the same thing she had told us. No one apologized for our wait or the miscommunication so we left disappointed. This visit was particularly upsetting because I was visiting in town from LA and I drove 30 minutes out of the way to come here because of the excellent yelp reviews. I can't attest to the food but the service is a NO.
