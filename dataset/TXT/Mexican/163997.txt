LGEIsxeJQATo9J1IA-TEdA Was in the mood for fajitas and found this place on Yelp. I'm new to area and had a friend who lives in the area meet me there.  We both agreed this place was awesome.  I've traveled quite a bit and these are the best fajitas I have ever eaten. We had half Cadillac and half chicken. Both had great flavor. Will be going back soon!
