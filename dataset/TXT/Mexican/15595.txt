16Md-YQqxnSVKgrnL_yx5g Dos Juevos has some big shoes to fill (post Julio G's). Here is my advice (I want them to make it). The menu is a total mess and the food is way too complicated. This is NOT a fancy restaurant. The atmosphere here begs for some old school combo plates with taco, tostada and enchilada combos served on inferno-hot plates. Keep it simple! Salsa is VERY important - you have to offer the hot thin stuff. Chips were soggy and undercooked. Also, this place is cavernous, rather than sacrifice on service (ours was embarrassingly slow) confine guests to the very front for now... Simplifying the menu will help with prep time too. Old Town needs more breakfast spots, so I would also encourage a breakfast-only southwest themed menu before noon. Throw in a food eating contest for good measure and you'll be on your way to fame. Good luck guys!!!
