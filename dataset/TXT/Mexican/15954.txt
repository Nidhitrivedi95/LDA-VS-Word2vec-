19S0gFtg5GTX6CkiApJiAQ First stop while here in Vegas! Didn't know what I was getting myself into, got here and the customer service was awesome. Our waitress/cashier let us try allllllll kindsaaaaa mixed frescas. It was awesome! 

I ordered a el pastor burrito and a pineapple, cucumber and lemonade Fresca. Before my order I tried the el pastor and it was delicious, obvious reason why I chose it for my burrito. 

Dove into my burrito and it was great as I expected. Added fried pineapples to it, I suggest you do the same! Great spot, awesome customer service and very clean. Overall 4.5/5. I'm here til Sunday(it's Thursday), I just might be back 1 more time. Great job Frijoles and Frescas! I've never bean more satisfied! (Check their shirts)
