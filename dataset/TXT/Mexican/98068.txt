ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA I am writing because I truly like this place.  The ambiance is great, and the first time we went the food was great.  But it hasn't been great since then (3 more visits) because of a couple of things.  It's all hard surfaces inside, and it is so loud it actually hurts my ears.  When we went for brunch, the music was just as loud.  These two things make talking with your table-mates very unpleasant, and it isn't relaxing.  Today we went for lunch - on a weekday when most people work - and there was no hurry on the service.  The fish and chips had good flavor but was way over done.  My salad was OK, but under-dressed.  In a town where there are many great choices, these issues make a return visit unlikely.  I hope the restaurant addresses these things because it's a great environment.
