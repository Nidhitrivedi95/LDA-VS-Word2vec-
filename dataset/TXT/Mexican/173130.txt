mFGUvyJSdSRjIaN94QW_IQ I have been here several one sand I have never had bad service or food. My toddler can be a handful at time but their colorful decor keeps him entertained. The burrito Acapulco is amazing their fajitas are also amazing there is not a Mexican place within 10 miles that I would compare it to. I absolutely love Anaya's and will be coming more often.
