pyeoyouJWxxcwzfugfessQ This restaurant is amazing! We are so excited to have a non-chain restaurant that has fantastic food and great service in Peoria! We started with an order of crispy brussels sprouts. They were so delicious that we had to order another one. I had a veg head taco and, as recommended by the server, The El Potato Head taco and added the chicken Tinga to it. My tacos had wonderfully complex flavors with delicious sauces. My friend ordered the same thing and loved hers as well. My husband ordered the Carne Asada bowl and said the flavors were wonderful! We will definitely return!
