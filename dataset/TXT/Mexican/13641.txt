0nki-StQkYNVHi5EQl-Ayw The tacos were the best thing I ordered (some of the best I've eaten in Phoenix as well.) Each type had a different topping/variety. The meats were delicious and not fatty. Place is legit! Their salsa is yummy as well. I had the gordita and didn't love it (kinda bland and lame after the exciting tacos), but I don't usually like the fried dough stuff in general.  Cheap and totally worth driving to Tolleson!!!
