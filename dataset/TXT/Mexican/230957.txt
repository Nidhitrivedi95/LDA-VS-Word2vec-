I am new to the area and Yelp has become my best friend when in search for new places to try. I was craving Mexican and landed on this place. The reviews overall looked good, so I thought I'd give it a try. When my date and I got there we walked in there were quite a few customers standing around the door looking like they were waiting to be helped. After about 5 minutes we were finally helped, mind you there were many open tables so they didn't seem to be super busy. After being sat down we both just asked for a water while looking over the "drink menu". They didn't really have a drink menu that I saw, just a list of tequilas. I wasn't aware what was on draft etc. It took longer than normal to get our beers. We then ordered chips and queso which also took longer than normal. I was unimpressed with the queso. It reminded me of Velveeta and a jar of salsa put in a cockpot, which is good. But not something I'm looking for a restaurant. The chips were also pretty greasy. I ordered the tacos with grilled Mahi Mahi. To me, the tacos were bland. It's hard to mess up refried beans and rice. Overall I just thought it lacked flavor and the service was not that great. I honestly don't think I'll go back.
