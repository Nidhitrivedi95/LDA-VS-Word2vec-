I really liked it here! We started with the Yucca bowl which is a must try. Yucca are like fries that don't make you hate yourself after eating a giant serving of them. All of the toppings were generous and awesome and we probably could have filled up on this alone. 

I'm glad a didn't though because the pork belly tacos were to die for! I especially loved the shell -- perfect mix of crunchy and chewy but stayed together. Obviously very fresh. The inside of the taco was really good too. The portion was just enough after the yucca bowl -- but might have left me wanting for more without and appetizer. 

Also delicious were the drinks! I had the pomegranate jalepeno (i think) margarita and it was really unique and delicious. Perfect for sipping. BF on the other hand sucked down the winter pear margarita in about three seconds flat -- which is a little too quickly for a $10 drink in my opinion but he was paying so who am I to judge?
