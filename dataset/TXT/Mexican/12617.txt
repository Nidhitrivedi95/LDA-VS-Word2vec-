They had a variety of 5 or 6 meats to choose from but from the 3 that I chose, they all tasted the same. They were really bland. I had the Butter Chicken, Carnitas and Ground Beef. Definitely not memorable or would be the reason to come back here.

I noticed one of the other reviews mentioned to have the Churros so I gave those a try too. These were surprisingly pretty good. They were served warm and were very crispy on the outside. For a cheap sweet snack, I recommend giving these a try. Unfortunately this place doesn't have chocolate or caramel syrup to fill the center. 

I'm not sure if it's worth coming back to try other things on the menu but if I have a craving for Churros I'd pick up one or two.
