frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A Good food keeps us coming back but overall services is not good and definitely not friendly. The hostess was absolutely horrible, not one smile and made us feel like we were inconveniencing her! One bright spot was the bartender that took our drink order well we waited for a table. The restaurant was enlarged recently but still a long wait and tons of open tables well we waited so either the kitchen or service wasn't ready for the larger space. Not sure how much longer we will keep going back if the service doesn't improve!
