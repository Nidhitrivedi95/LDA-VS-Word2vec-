-2EAyppKR_2xuLyvJZEbRQ After Fat Bastard Burrito in Liberty Village became a disappointment I needed a new burrito spot close by. A friend recommended I try this place and I must say it's pretty good. So far I've tried their large chicken burrito (do not attempt unless you are ready to sleep for a couple hours after), steak burrito and a couple of their burrito bowl options. They've all been pretty good. Ingredients are fresh and they're not tight with the guacamole like Fat Bastard is. Id give it a 3.5 star but that's not an option here so I give it a four simply because their large burrito is the size of a bottle of wine.
