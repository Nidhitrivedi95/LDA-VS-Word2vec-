2CNaSduqZIsCRuNvdO_TAQ The amount that they give you is minuscule for the burrito bowl, and the only things I don't get are beans and sour cream. 

We came here on a Sunday right at lunchtime, and there was almost no one there. Yes, some people came and got take out, but still. One customer had ordered ahead of time, and despite how free they were, they hadn't made his order by the time he got there, so they asked him to wait while they made his food. What's the point of ordering ahead then????
