7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA I went to this well talked about place after i saw a picture of the french toast that a friend of mine posted on facebook.  

We went on a Sunday afternoon prime time brunch. As we got there, there seemed to already be a queue of people waiting.  We decided to stand in line as it appeared that the wait could be within half an hour.

Lucky for us, after 20 minutes, we were able to get a table for two. Unfortunately, we went on a hot summer day and the place was devoid of any air conditioning. To solve that problem, i immediately ordered their fresh squeezed lemonade to quench my thirst and to cool off.

As i perused the menu, there was a multitude of selections.  Everything looked good as i looked up to see what the people at the other tables were having.  I zeroed in on the poached eggs with bacon and potatoes & side salad/toast.  When the food arrived, i was not disappointed. Everything tasted fresh, the bacon was premium bacon, and the eggs/potato and toast were amazing. Although i was disappointed i could not have a taste of the french toast as well, i was very satisfied with my order.

Overall, the ambiance was good, the price was reasonable (approx. $15 per person).  The quality of the food was good, the service was reasonable (no overly attentive wait staff such as a 5 star fine dining and given how busy they are but adequate when you compare it to Chinatown). I would definitely recommend this place and would go back.  For the people that expect diner style portions and food, this probably isn't the place for you.  You get quality over quantity here...but who needs anything more?
