a8pmtlVKf7NiSLI-4KejIw Came here for the 12 course tasting menu and was shockingly disappointed considering the hype. The margaritas are amazing but the guac was the type your 8 your old nephew would make. It's just so off from what it should be but you feel obliged to eat it and tell them it's alright. Only the creamed corn fish was worth it, all other plates just were not worth the money.
