XGPBQJNTq5qxFZPQR32f3g So glad to be able to once again experience those awesome soft chicken tacos from Guedo's!!  I've been in withdrawal since the original shop was closed.  It's nice to see that they are staying true to the recipies.  Love the new location (it's closer to me now)!!  If you haven't tried Guedo's - do it NOW!!!!
