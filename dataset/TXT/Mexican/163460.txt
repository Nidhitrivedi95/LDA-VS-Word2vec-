lewN3yvie6jSbRNuyAV0GQ Two things. Some serious stomach gut pain right after eating their 5 dollar cravings deal and why the heck is the dine in closed randomly all of the sudden. I ordered a 5 dollar cravings deal months ago (stopped going there) at around 5 to 7 pm on Saturday. After a couple of hours, the inside of my stomach felt like it tearing a little. This pain lasted for 2 whole weeks and I was not happy or satisfied with this experience at all. Also, their survey is a scam. I did a total of 100 surveys out of all my visits and never won. I think they only give the 500 dollars to people who work there, friends, or relatives. Or people who spend hundreds regularly.

 Recently like weeks ago, they kept the dine in closed for no reason. I went back 2 different days and both days were closed. They only serve drive thru. Not sure if the dine in is still closed.
