FJB280slE6ZDFbPl3sowFA Highly priced, garbage food. The ground beef is an absolute joke. Ordered a Mexican pizza, beef bland, dry, did not complement the other ingredients. The crispy shell underneath the mess did not hold up well and became soggy and wet very quickly. The burger was no better. Just more of the same bland, dry, rubbery beef. I love Mexican food and was very excited to try this establishment. Nothing but disappointment.
