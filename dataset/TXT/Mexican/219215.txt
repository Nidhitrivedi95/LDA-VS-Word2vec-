rcSFEzRoIcDZhf8Frrm71A I tried this place about 10 years ago and wasn't particularly impressed; I thought the food then was kind of greasy. But after a couple of people recently recommended it to me, I figured I'd give it another try. Their banner outside proclaimed that they've got the best green chile burrito, so I went with their signature dish.

Disappointing. It was bland and didn't have a lot of flavor. Green chile is supposed to give you a zing in your mouth, but this one didn't. Keep in mind that the last green chile burrito I had prior to this one was from Rito's in downtown Phoenix; the burrito from Rito's might be one of the best I've ever had anywhere. Espo's version didn't come close. I want to like this place because it's got a funky old Mexican decor and the people seem nice, but their green chile just fell way short for me.
