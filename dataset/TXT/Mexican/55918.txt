a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg This is an amazing restaurant.  Great food and even greater Margaritas, and the staff is super friendly and helpful.  There are only 2 down falls, they are a bit on the pricey side, 2 meals with 2 margaritas, $50 not including tip, and they are in a no so great part of town.  My best girlfriend and I walked from the north strip of Las Vegas Blvd. to here and though we had no troubles, we were approached by shady characters twice, and no I don't mean beggars.  Just keep your eyes open.  The trip is well worth the food, if you drive vs. walking you would probably have no problems what so ever.
