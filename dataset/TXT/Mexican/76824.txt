cjxPOPcFkpq0cspQ2cHL8w Famous Mexican place that's been around forever. Used to be amazing and a truly one of a kind experience. Then the owner handed down the restaurant to a daughter or daughters I'm told. Like night and day now. My girlfriends family has been going there for 30 years! The waitresses who worked there for the longest time knew them all by name. The new owners have let the place go. Not even her parents who have been going there for 3 decades will go back. Truly a shame because the food is great, the private bar was about as great as it gets. Now you can't even get an alcoholic beverage because the bartenders quit. That was our favorite part was the private bar. We go there before it opened and when it did we had to wait 10 minutes before we could be seated as one of the first customers in the door. Then another 20 minutes for drinks, chips and salsa. Extremely disappointed.
