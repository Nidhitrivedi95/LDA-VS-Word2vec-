5eKk8dA1QtKaQr_5i_SCRw RUSHING customers and CHEAP service!

My coworkers and I have been there several times before, but this time I realized how their servers just need some basic training on how to properly treat customers. In terms of food, I give them a 3.5 stars, but the service is 1 star and I would recommend everyone to think 2x before going, especially during lunch rush.

We first arrived when the restaurant was still relatively empty, and after we ordered food it started to get packed and the server also started to rush us. After waiting for 10-15mins for our entrée, literally within 5 minutes of getting our food she came to give us our bill! I totally understand if she just left it there and wait for us to pay, but after another 10 mins she came back AGAIN and told each of us "here's your bill" as if we're blind that we didn't see it the first time. If this is not a sign to rush us out the door, I don't know what is. Giving us 15 mins to eat our food when it took you 10mins to serve it does not seem like the right way to treat customers.

In addition, we ordered one salsa and one queso for three people as appetizer and we were served 1 portion of chips. That's okay because we thought we could get more. But then we didn't ask for more until the end where she already rushed us to pay the check, and at that point the server said we could not get anymore because it's only for dine in. Thanks for giving us one order of chips for three of us with 2 sauces and not letting us get some more at the end for to-go. Now we have about a whole bowl of sauce left with less than 10 c hips! If only we asked for it before we paid, she could have given it to us..but we'd just pack it to go anyways. So what's the difference?! It's just rude....if you want your restaurant to be more empty during lunch hour, well, your wish came true.
Let's just say there are also items we found in the food we didn't complain about or the missing food items that we let go of.
