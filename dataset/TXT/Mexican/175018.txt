moZpwq1hNxC-uJRpfupOTA Ok, ok the first time that I went here I was a little confused on the concept. Mainly because I was young and dumb and had no idea that there was a Carlsbad in New Mexico (my heart & brain was sooo naive) and couldn't figure out the bats inside the restaurant (fake bats everyone, no bats were harmed while doing this review). But the first taste of the chips and salsa I didn't care where this place was, I just knew I needed this and couldn't wait for my meal. 

Fast forward 8 or so years, I still have the same excitement when I go. But now know there's a place in New Mexico with amazing the flavours, hence the hatched green chilies. The food is still just as decadent as my first time. I would lick the plate if people wouldn't judge me on that. But that's just how good this place is! My goal is to make it there for brunch and do my happy food dance when it's in front of me. 

This is such a nice and relaxing spot for fun, dates or to just sit in the bar and talk with the people around you. You can't go wrong with the food, the customer service or the ambiance.
