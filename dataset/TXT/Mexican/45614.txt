7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA I ve been here a few times and overall the food is very good.  They have this mexican-style egg dish (sorry, cant remember exact name) that is awesome - scrambled eggs, salsa, tortilla chips, guac...  You can tell everything is homemade.  I would go more often except there is always a long lineup on the weekends.
