m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw First of all ask for Miguel!! The service from him & his side kick was 5 star! Second of all, the food is awesome. Salsa- great! I am vegetarian and they have amazing vegetarian options. I had the artichoke avocado enchiladas - superb. Black beans are wow! Don't order the rice as it has chicken stock in it (if you are vegetarian). We got treated like we are in a five-star restaurant. Margaritas excellent- we got the Cadillac margarita. Beer on tap - top notch! For "checking in" we are getting free fried ice cream and are following it with a Bailey's and coffee. We have about five restaurants that we cycle & we have just added this one to our list. I consider us very picky and all three of us loved this dinner! We are foodies in our DNA!
