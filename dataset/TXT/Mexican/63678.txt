But what we liked about this place is that it actually fused both sushi and Mexican in a way that was very tasty.  The other location just tasted like a big giant sushi roll, which was good too.  But I give Soho props for really making it unique and fusing both types of food in a way you can satisfy your sushi and burrito cravings at the same time.  They are new, so didn't find their menu online at the time, but we went and ordered pick up with ease.  Recommended
