lrAUseySfmFeZkWOGfsKnQ The asada tacos are droned in from Jalisco, Mexico. At least that's what they taste like. Authentic does not describe the taste or the freshness. And I was pretty sure the owner Miguel went out back and grabbed a chicken to make my pollo tacos. He denied it, although I thought a feather fall off his baseball cap when he served me!
