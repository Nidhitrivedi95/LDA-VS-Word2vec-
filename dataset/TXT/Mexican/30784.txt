4DLsC4BTUoEqFGusetQVlQ Coming in was a bit confusing. I told the hostess we needed a table for two, there were a few other groups waiting around with us. The the hostess just walked away from her stand. I guess we were supposed to follow her but she didn't address us... it was weird.  My liked my beef cheek taco but not too impressed with the pollo fuego can't put my finger on what put me off.  Street corn was pretty good. My husband got the tortilla chips and bean/queso dip. It was good but it was cold. I expected it to be warm, still good though. So chips, dip, 2 tacos and two ears of corn. $30
