8-NRKkPY1UiFXW20WXKiXg *update I had half of my burrito yesterday and had the other half today for lunch. A piece of potato fell out from my burrito onto my plate and had a hair on it! Looks like an eyelash or eyebrow hair BARF! I added the picture to the pics on here.

I agree with a lot of the other negative posters. They try and trick you a lot by not putting the meat in at all! Ordered an Arizona burrito except I asked for no steak but the shredded meat instead with NO egg. So I get home and its all egg and onion. ZERO MEAT not even one piece. I went all the way back from goodyear to avondale and opened up my burrito. I said why is there ONLY egg in my Arizona burrito and wheres the shredded meat? She then told me she got confused because the shredded meat normally comes with egg and I was like but I said NO EGG and how does that explain that there is ZERO MEAT and ZERO CHEESE IN HERE TOO? Anyway long story short waste of gas, I got an only egg and onion burrito but she ended up getting it fixed .
