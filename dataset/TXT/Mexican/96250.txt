EIZnpMr9ccgutaGzGjzZ9g Who would have though orange and pink would work? Well, at this Mexican restaurant it certainly does, and with the beautiful tiling and bright cocktails the experience is positively technicoloured. Another unlikely combination is that of chilli and chocolate, found in at least one of the excellent (and generous) dishes. At least it means you can save on a pudding. I do not advise this, however, and strongly urge everybody to sample them all, at the same time.
