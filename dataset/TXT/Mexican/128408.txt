i-Bu8g-y6fuLFAmLsGo0GQ Routinely visit here for takeout. Massive burritos with creative toppings. Ground beef, feature red ale kettle pork, and battered fish are my favorites. I've found the steak on the salty side.  Nice job finishing on the grill for heat and texture.  

IMO best chain burrito joint around and I've had them all. Definitely recommend.
