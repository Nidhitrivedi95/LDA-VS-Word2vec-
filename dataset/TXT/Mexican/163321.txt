lENkF6Cgd9WzUDBcuZcAPA Excellent food! All of the meats are amazing. I have had the burritos a few times and cannot complain at all! Its like a high end subway for burritos and tacos! I do admit sometimes the line at lunch is a little long but its well worth the wait! I will be back many many times! Up next will be the surf and turf burrito or the shrimp tacos which I saw in real life and instantly wish I would have got. Good job Mucha Lucha!
