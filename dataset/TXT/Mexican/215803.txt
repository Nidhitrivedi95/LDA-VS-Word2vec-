This place has good food but ZERO customer service. If you use the delivery service expect your order to be wrong, they will not send out hot sauce and when you call to complain they just don't care. For extra fun try asking for a manager....

Really disappointed in these guys





***********************************
I have used Eat24 to have them deliver to my house and while the 3rd party delivery service are slow (60 - 80 minutes) and rude, most every time the food has been delicious. I just finished eating the best fajitas I have ever eaten from anywhere and it came from this place. 

So far I have tried the Carne Asada Burrito which was pretty good, Carne asada fries which were just delicious and the Chicken Fajitas which as I mentioned were the best I ever had. 

Enjoy!

***Update we have eaten here many many times since my initial review.***

This place has the best fish tacos I have ever eaten. They have a deal where you can get two Fish Tacos and two Carne Asada tacos for around 7 dollars. Some of my other favorites here are the Grande Breakfast Burrito which is the biggest Burrito I have ever gotten from anywhere, the Chilli Releno pepper which is just $2.99 and smothered in cheese and the Super Nachos. 

This is my favorite place to get Mexican food in AZ.
