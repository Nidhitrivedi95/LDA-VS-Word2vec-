qS6J-sxyrP45d-8LbIhWKg I came here on a fight night to watch UFC fights. My group got there very early so it was dead. Just a few people at the bar and maybe 2 or 3 other tables besides us. No hostess, nobody seated us, it took a girl about 10 minutes to bring us chips and salsa and the another 20 minutes to ask for our drink order. Luckily, the UFC event was long so we were in no rush. We ordered mangoneadas, micheladas, and remedios drinks. They were great and I highly recommend them. 
We also ordered the torta, burger, and I got an order of hot wings. The torta and burger were small portions and we're just...eh. 
I ordered the hot wings with tamarindo sauce. They were really good actually! However, I was upset because the menu clearly said "acompañadas con papas fritas" which means "comes with French fries." When I received my order, there were no fries. I asked the server about my fries and she said it doesn't come with fries. So I picked up the menu again to make sure it wasn't my error and it clearly said it came with fries. So I asked again and showed her where it said that. She said, "Yeah I know it says that but it doesn't come with fries." Wait, what? Why would you refuse what's on your menu? Or why wouldn't you correct your menu? That made me so mad about this place.
However, my friends shared their fries with me and they had no flavor so I guess I saved myself some empty calories. 

For a UFC event, it actually wasn't super crowded so it's a good place to watch events. However, I recommend eating somewhere else and coming here just for drinks. The food won't blow you away but the drinks are great!

Oh, and the music they play is extremely loud. It's nice to have Mexican music playing but you seriously have to yell in someone's ear so they can hear you. It got a little annoying. Turn it down a bit!
