gOBxVkHpqtjRRxHBIrpnMA I have been coming to this location for several years. This time, I went on a busy Friday night. I'm vegetarian and have less topping options so I asked for more vegetables and was refused with dramatic hand gestures by the employees. My burrito bowl ended up being a smaller portion than everyone else's. Also, the rice was overcooked with no spices or cilantro in it, and the texture and consistency resembled Chinese sticky rice. I attached a picture of the revolting rice for reference. Please ask your staff to give the correct amount of food and keep their attitude to themselves. Terrible experience this time.
