JvqnkVL7dvpucjhKRsWjrw Pleasantly surprised!! My family got take out, and that food was well cooked and packaged. So I would say that suggests dine in is even better. I am surprised that Plaza Agave still survives down the road, this spot is much better. 

I will say though that calling in an order was rough - I had to scream in the phone. But when we picked up it was calm and quiet?? What's up with that. Also the complimentary salsa tasted strongly of oregano and tomato (of course). So I felt like I was eating marinara sauce and chips... Uhhhhh weird. 

But anyways, olé!!!
