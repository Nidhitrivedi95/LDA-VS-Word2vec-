YQFcxE9UXrKc-QuTUu7twQ The drinks were disappointing for a Friday night out on the town. I ordered the Cadillac margarita and the Loco-lada. Being from Southern California and now living in AZ I've had my share of orgasmic/ fantastic margaritas, so to come here and have the first page of the drink menu be all about margaritas I was really expecting good margaritas. They were both bland and I could hardly tell if alcohol had even made it into the glass. I don't like my alcohol overpowering but I like to know it's at least in my $9-$12 drink! 

However...

The saving grace is the salt and pepper wings!!! The habanero wings are great as well!!! 

In short, I'd go back for the wings but skip the drinks unless I grab a beer!
