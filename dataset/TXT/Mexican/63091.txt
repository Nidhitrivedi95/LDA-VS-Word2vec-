AxtpV77aaiJu3vSweEXZ9g The food quality and quantity definitely went down hell.  Ordered a special chicken dish but where is chicken?!  All I got was some strings of chicken and lots black beans.  This is the first visit at this location and the serving bowels for salsa and bean dip were so small made it difficult to grab dip.  Totally disappointed and will not be back to this location!  Tempe location is far better!
