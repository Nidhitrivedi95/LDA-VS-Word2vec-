UFVy-8WC7pDzvBUzOvdwzA We have been here a handful of times, and every time we come we always have a horrible experience. The owner yelled at us for ordering more chips for our queso dip, we sat for 20 minuets waiting to be addressed, never got refills, never talked to after our food was delivered. It's just endless negative visits. The only reason we come back is for the food, but this will be the last time. I had to get my food to go because it took forever to be brought to the table, and it was cold too.
