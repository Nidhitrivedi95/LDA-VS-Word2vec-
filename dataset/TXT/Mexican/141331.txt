jAsvKe4-SteA-ZgyfVPoTQ Oh boy....where to begin?  Came here for a holiday party and couldn't wait to leave.  Tacky paint and decor is an understatement.  Picture National Lampoon's Vegas Vacation and the awful casino/restaurant Clark and Eddie go to.  Once we were inside a suggested an immediate trip to the bar to have a shot and kick this thing off.  $8.50 a shot for Patron.  Dinner was upstairs in their "banquet room".  Yikes, more tacky paint and their holiday decor was a mixture of semi lit lights, branches of a fir tree, and plastic ornaments.  The food was actually edible and the comedy that was this experience is what earns it the second star.  Do yourself a favor and skip the bathroom.  I'm pretty sure it hasn't been cleaned in years and be careful in the parking lot as there are potholes throughout.  Good luck and remember some Pepto before you go to sleep.
