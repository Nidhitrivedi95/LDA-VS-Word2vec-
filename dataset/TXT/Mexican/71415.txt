C2BR0TjNacoNzItPLUHTAA Stopped in this place for lunch, it was our first time. I had the fish tacos, they were good and fresh. It had a little too much cabbage, etc for me which over took the fish in the taco. My wife had the Poke bowl which was greasy and delicious. We shared the coconut shrimp appetizer which was a generous portion to share.
