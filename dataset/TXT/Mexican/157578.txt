KMxOoHyRKP74PgosuRkkdg Looking around Yelp for something special in the area while traveling and my family and I enjoyed the photos and reviews for this spot, so we stopped in for dinner. Not sure why, but we had an awful experiance. Was extremely disappointed with the staff, quality of the food and experience overall.

Family of six and no one enjoyed their meal and said we should have gone to Del Taco after eating here. 

I ordered the ribeye tacos and they looked good, but the meat tasted awful, was super thin and cut up into very small chunks with a bad taste to it and even the tortilla tasted bad.  The fresh avocado was a nice touch, but this dish was a total fail!

My wife went with a mix of tacos. She said the barbacoa was very oily and could have used salt, chicken was very peppery and tasted like it came out of a bag and like be hated the ribeye.

The kids meals that come with a drink and side which is cool. We got quesadillas and unfortunately they were not good. The kids did not eat them and said they tasted bad. Sampling them to see what was up, my wife and I both agreed they were super super salty. $7 x 2 fail on the kids meals.

My son got $10 nachos with no sour cream.  Then when it came it had no beans and sour cream and when I told them that this was not what context (very politely) they argued with me and said I never said no sour cream and I said no beans. My son and I both were pretty clear at the register no sour and perhaps they heard no beans. The nachos were awful! The cheese wiz with peppery chicken that tasted like it was pulled out of a bag. The chips were very greasy and really did not work for nachos. This was an epic fail and I am very surprised this place has such good reviews considering everything we had was bad.
