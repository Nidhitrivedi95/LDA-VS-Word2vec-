4j0WfdS_lHG9uSH7cd1PFg Nice concept, nice staff. Unfortunately I had the beer battered fish tacos and can't get the fishy taste out of my mouth. I love fish but this was just too fishy. Combo with 2 tacos, chips and very small green salsa with regular drink came to $13. Think I'd pass on returning.
