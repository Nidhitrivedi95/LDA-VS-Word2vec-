iIFMeiovZ2o7RzJ_1YYVww Authentic restaurant, always soccer on the TV. :) Helpful, self serve salsas, and great prices. I order a marinated pork burrito with sour cream when I go, but have tried other menu items too. 
They also have Jamaica which I haven't found elsewhere yet.
The number inline doesn't work, but they are happy to five you their number if you come in, they also can prepare orders ahead of time.
