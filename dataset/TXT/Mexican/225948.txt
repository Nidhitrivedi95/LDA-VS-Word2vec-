RWYQMss0RzbtDGGwRI3iaQ Mexican food is usually not my first choice but it was for a friend's birthday so who am I to raise a stink? Gotta say though, the food was really good. The service... not so much.

Good luck A) getting the server's attention to ask for a drink and B) actually GETTING said drink. 

We were seated upstairs which is a small yet spacious area right by the bar. No reason for the server, who seemed dangerously under-aged to be serving drinks in the first place, to be unaware of the table of 7 he was waiting on. Is it safe to say maybe he was having a bad night? Hell, perhaps with midterms just around the corner, he was pre-occupied. Whatever the reason, it does not encourage repeat business.

When he was paying attention, he was very rude so midterms or not, that also doesn't encourage repeat business.

Other annoying bits:
* Pitcher of mojito serves 4 as oppose to 7 as stated
* One thing I never mention in most reviews is the importance of getting the bill when the patrons ask for it. This may be just as crucial as taking their orders. Asking for the bill proved to be just as difficult as asking for a drink.
* No debit. And not a "we were never equipped with it" but "we got rid of it". Wow, you guys REALLY don't want people coming into your establishment, do you? Well, if you insist...
