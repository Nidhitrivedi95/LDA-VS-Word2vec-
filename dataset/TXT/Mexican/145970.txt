jIzygnVmajEXYmfsBNY_Gw I had come here looking for pollo with my friend or carne asada. This place doesn't have it. It has shredded meat soft corn tacos. They have 2 sizes small and large. The small are mini, and the large are regular sized tacos. I didn't understand the sizing at first, and ordered 2 small chicken tacos.  You can eat it in two normal bites. While the flavor was pretty good, at $2 a piece for the minis, I just don't think it is worth it, and I'm definitely more into the asada type or veggie tacos.
