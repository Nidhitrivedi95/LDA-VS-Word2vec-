F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw By far the best margarita in the city of Cleveland. Hands down. I am not kidding! On top of that the food is divine and the service is great. 

The only reason I don't give Momocho 5 stars is because of the limited space. There is really hardly any room for a decent gathering and you often have to share tables making it a little less intimate for a night with your lover. 

That being said what you will eat and drink will be wellllll worth it!
