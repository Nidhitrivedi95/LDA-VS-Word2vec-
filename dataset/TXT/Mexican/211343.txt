qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A This place is so cool. It reminds me of my weekend foodie visits to LA with their vibe and decor. Travis was our server last night (super awesome btw) and helped me decide on their signature fried chicken dish. It was THE best fried chicken I'd ever eaten. It had a nice kick of spice, which I loved and wasn't expecting and so much flavor overall. They paired it with some mixed veggies and cornbread, which were the icing on the cake. I'm definitely coming back for their Sunday brunch.
