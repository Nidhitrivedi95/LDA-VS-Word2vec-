qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A I was looking for a new spot to enjoy Sunday brunch. DW Bistro was an excellent choice. The food is great, the staff is very friendly and the space is comfortable. We sat outside and thought that I was on vacation. Beautiful greenery was all around and hid the parking lot nicely. Well done. 

Everyone from our table enjoyed their food and drinks. If you enjoy a sweet dish, the French toasts are some of the best I have had in a long time. The chicken lollipops are very nice as well. The slow-cooked pork was fork tender. I have to admit that I was not a fan of their red velvet cake. I thought it was too dry. Their coffee was excellent. 

Nothing to complain about the staff. Every single person we interacted with was truly friendly.
