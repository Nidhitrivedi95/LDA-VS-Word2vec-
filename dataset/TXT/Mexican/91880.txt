e-X1HcALttCuuHtl0wU_gg Methinks not is right. This place continues to disappoint. The food is overpriced and I don't know why I came back here, especially since the last time I swore this place off forever. Silly me. I ordered the steak salad, which comes with lettuce, steak, and then you get to add all of your toppings like cheese, salsa, beans etc. They asked if I wanted any dressing for my salad, I said I would take the chipotle ranch. The lady gives me a smalll 2 oz cup of dressing for a large salad. I asked for another dressing AFTER I paid, so they wouldn't attempt to charge me. Well the joke's on me, that ranch was DISGUSTING. It was probably some Sysco brand goop, mixed with ass, it was horrible!  I had already poured most of it onto my salad, so I couldn't eat anything more. I debated whether or not to ask for a refund, but figured I would just chalk it up as a loss and never return. One of the only things I did like about this place is they have the Freestyle Coke machine, but everyone has that now and even still if they were the only restaurant in the world that had that machine, I wouldn't step foot in this place again. I mean it this time.
