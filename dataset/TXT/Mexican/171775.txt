MAuSh7NKoT__CQ4BumoayA Food was good! Service was strange. I am here in Vegas for a large convention and I came to get a quick dinner by myself. The hostess didn't seem to want to seat me as if sitting a single person would be a task. Once seated, it took awhile for someone to come to the table to serve me.  After that it was as if I was an alien or something. T&T get your customer service in check. Other than that everything was good!
