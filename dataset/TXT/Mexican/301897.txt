zw9_mqWBn1QCfZg88w0Exg Although Chevy's is not the most authentic Mexican you will find, I don't think it quite deserves the bad reviews I've seen.

I stopped in here for lunch after an appointment with my eye doctor in the mall.  It wasn't busy, and I sat at the bar.  The service was fast and very friendly. I only ordered a water, but was also quickly brought chips and salsa.  The chips weren't my favorite, they didn't seem authentic, but I liked the salsa.

I wasn't really impressed with the menu selections - especially on their lunch menu, but I decided to go with the farmer's market enchiladas.  They were supposed to be made with mushrooms and artichokes (I love both), but there were tons of other veggies in there as well.  I am not sure I saw an artichoke, and I only saw 1 mushroom, but they were still tasty.  They were served with a side of rice and grilled vegetables (no beans? In a "Mexican" restaurant?).

Overall, it was a good experience - nothing mind blowing, but not horrible.  The service was great and I was in and out of there pretty quickly.  I wouldn't mind coming back for their weekday happy hour.
