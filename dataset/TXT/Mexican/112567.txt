G81PxmvajV-M-fZWopK4kg Came here for some tacos with my girls, that's what they were craving. I don't know why this location got so many low reviews, but as soon as we came in it was a good experience. Was immediately greeted. Tables were clean and had a basket of all the sauces they offer including ketchup! They took our order, and even took our tray of food to us when it was ready, we didn't wait long.

The bathrooms were decent and parking was easy since they had their own lot. The view while eating is people washing and vacuuming their cars at the car was next door. All in all a good food trip, for 50 cent tacos, we'll be back!
