JXiOlujB1i7aZvkNJ9xpzQ I came here a few days ago with some friends. As far as it goes, Tres Portrillas does not deviate much from other Mexican restaurants I've been to. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though! 

The chips and salsa are excellent; the chips are easily the size of my face. The staff was always ready to refill the chip bowls and salsa (which I'm not ashamed to admit happened more than four times...within like 20 minutes).

The main entree (supreme enchiladas) was decent - four enchiladas with one cheese, one beef, one chicken, and one bean. Not the best I've had, but definitely not bad for ~$12. 

If you're not willing to risk the stomach illness from Taco Bell and want some Mexican, go ahead and come here!
