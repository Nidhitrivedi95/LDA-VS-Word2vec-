m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw I really really wanted to like this restaurant. It's at Downtown Summerlin, so I'm thinking "elevated". Not so much. First, the service was AWESOME! Also, the decor and ambiance was fantastic. That's where it gets 2 stars. 

The food was just not good. I got the chicken fajitas thinking it was nice and basic. How could you go wrong? Dry chicken, spices that made it taste horrible, brown guacamole and dry rice. Very high priced and a chain restaurant like Chili's leaves it in the dust, which is a shame. 

My friend's meal wasn't much better. 

This place has potential to be awesome. They have great service from the minute you walk in until the minute you leave. The restaurant itself is beautiful. But the food needs a lot of work for how much you're spending. 

Honestly, greasy Roberto's or some of the small taco stands have better food. It's very disappointing.
