jS3U9iEGnJY7j5oT9iDN7A I enjoyed my visit after some doubt reading reviews here on yelp. Seated right away with a great table with fireplace next to our table. Chips and salsa were fresh made and awesome had to have two baskets. Had chimmichangas which were average and combo plate with taco and a tamale which I enjoyed a lot. I would come back for sure.
