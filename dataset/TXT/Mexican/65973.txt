BEplfZTUzYwApjMUaOA12w Food: Excellent. If you have a tamale with lobster and goat cheese on the menu, I'm intrigued. But the fact that it tasted amazing.... that's another story! 

Drinks: I indulged in a Corona, can't mess that up. My friends enjoyed the pomegrante margarita. They ordered a 2nd pitcher, so they must have been good!! 

Salsa/Chips: Great!! This is often an indicator for me if the rest of the meal is going to be enjoyable. Taqueria Canonita passed this test! 

And of course it's set alongside the Grand Canal in Venice.... okay, the faux Grand Canal in the Venetian Hotel. Still-- great view, great experience, excellent service too. I will definitely be back!!
