7JQ5SNrrlCfkghYFzhOVUw Just left here and must say I am utterly disappointed in the food, and terrible excuse of service we had. First we sat for 10 minutes before we were even asked for our drink orders! Secondly we had finally put in our orders for food and had been sitting for a bit and a couple was seated by us and got their food about 10 minutes after sitting! How does that even happen? We waited another 15 minutes before getting our meals and were finally brought refills after asking and sitting there with no drinks for the past 20 minutes. Our server checked on us once the entire time we were there and the food was disgusting. Fajitas were 80% vegetables(with PICKLED jalapeños) and 20% meat, chimichanga wasn't much better unless you like yours filled with onions and bell peppers and a little meat. Our bill was $50, needless to say i will never return or recommend this place!
