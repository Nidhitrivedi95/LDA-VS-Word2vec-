I was so happy for that. We ordered chips and salsa: I'm not a big fan of Green Salsa but theirs was pretty good!. Hubs got a Carne Asada Burrito which he devoured. I got the same with Enchilada style. And devoured. 
They do have a bar which was interesting. Hubs ordered a Michilada which he liked. But of course I could not give a 5th star because there is a Victoria sign which we thought they would have that beer but they did not. Other than that I would come back when I'm in the area!
