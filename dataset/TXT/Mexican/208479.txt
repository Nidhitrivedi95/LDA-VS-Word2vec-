QDRFdG8gPPKL7r4yic8j7Q The Burrito Company is casual, authentic mexican food with top-notch flavor in a hole-in-the-wall environment.  

The carne asada is amazing - try the California Burrito with Carne Asada.  Flavorful meat, spicy pico, refried beans and rice wrapped into a fresh flour tortilla.  Another favorite is the chicken chimi with chicken that tastes like it's been stewing in spices and vegetables all day it's a wonderful dish.  Its basic, but vibrant, flavors are complemented by the sour cream and salsa that comes with it.
All dishes come with fresh tortilla chips and salsa is help yourself at the salsa bar.

The Burrito Co. also has great breakfast burritos from egg, cheese and potato to chorizo - they have everything you could want.
