My friends who ordered off of the HH menu all got the bbq pork sliders which came with two sliders and fries--$5!!!

I, who ordered off of the regular menu, was able to choose from about 8-10 different fillers for my tacos.  I chose the shredded chicken and the carne asada which is a dollar more.  The shredded chicken was really good, but I wouldn't recommend the carne asada--too dry and small chunks of steak.  (Maybe I'm not a carne asada fan.)  They let me get more beans because I don't eat white rice.  I also liked that I could get charro beans (but not the kind I'm used to) instead of refried beans.

It's a fun place and attracts a young crowd.
