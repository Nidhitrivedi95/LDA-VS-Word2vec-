cChJhpiljARaINk-dyXGiQ My Wife and I have been here 2 times in the last week. So far the food has been very good and the service has been friendly. I wish they had tortilla soup. The prices are very reasonable. My wife really likes their fried ice cream. Margaritas and Coronas would be a good addition also but not a deal breaker. We will be back soon. Nice place.
