5KdyfLCaKi99zLIr3BdIZw My family and I decided on this restaurant last Friday. Mostly because it was Friday and every other restaurant was super crowded. I don't know why i thought we should stop at the Mexican restaurant with the empty parking lot.
     When we pulled in an employee walked out, my husband and i figured she was coming to tell us the restaurant was closed, but she was just taking a smoke break.. i mean lollipop break. it looked like a cig but my hubs told me it was a sucker...she just stared at us and didnt say anything so we assumed it was open and walked in.
     the waitress who seated us was very nice.. the atmosphere seemed like a family restaurant. the chips and salsa were decent..i ordered the chicken and beef burritos with the side of rice and a strawberry Margarita .. when my drink came out it was huge but it was obviously a mix and it wasnt very cold so i could barely drink it.. my chicken burrito was okay..  the beef burrito was much worse than any taco meat that I've ever made at home.. much worse.. the rice was okay but then i noticed what seemed to be canned peas and carrots mixed in.. my husband got the enchiladas with mole sauce with steak on the side and rice.. he ate his. but said he would much rather spend less money and go to chipotle.. the steak was also just okay..
       so we left the restaurant and i felt nauseous for the rest of the night.. this was the worst Mexican food that I've ever eaten.  its too bad because our server was so nice and i really wanted to like this place.
