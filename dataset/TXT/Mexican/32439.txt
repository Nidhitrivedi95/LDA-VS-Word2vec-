Their carnitas tacos are my fave. They make their tortillas fresh. Also order their elotes, omg so good! 

If you're looking for some adult beverages,  I would have to say this place has the best micheladas in Vegas. Can't really go wrong with any of their drinks! 

The whole staff is awesome and super attentive. They will happily help if you have any questions about the menu. 

Great place to hang if you're in the area. I haven't tried the other location yet, but I'm sure it's just as great.
