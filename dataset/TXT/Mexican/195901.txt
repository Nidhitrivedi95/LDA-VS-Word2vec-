oXIYs7rxT-bdgpeYzBfrzA I have been going to this same Caramba for 20 years.  The past few visits I have noticed the service go lower, but last night I ordered their green chili and chicken folded quesadilla with white cheese.  While the food was OK, I could have gone swimming in the grease.  I must have used 5 or 6 napkins to remove grease from my hands.  I finally cut up the rest ate some and threw the rest away.  I think the brothers need to start overseeing the operation again.
