Party size: 2

Wait to be seated: none
Ambience: Lively and has a good vibe to it. 
Price: $$ - Good value during happy hour. 

And now the reason you go to a restaurant...

Food quality:  High-quality organic ingredients and homemade quality.  

Food taste: overall, the food was relatively bland.  The ingredients were a great base to build on top of. For example, we ordered different varieties of tacos and if the tacos had a little bit more salt, pico de gallo, guacamole, and sour cream they would've been amazing.  Granted, you can add all these things extra but it would've been nice to have this additional flavor added directly from the kitchen.

Would I go back?  Probably not.  My primary recommendations for great Mexican cuisine include Barrio Cafe (great Mexican fusion - not a beans and rice place) or Frank and Lupe's in old town Scottsdale.
