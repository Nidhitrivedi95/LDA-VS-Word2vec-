DyOzNIeXUksPNLXYHnB-oQ After almost a year, I decided it was time to give Sabor another shot. I had gone a long time ago for their $1 Taco Tuesdays, and I just left feeling ... meh. I think I was so psyched up for it because of the rave reviews, and it just didn't deliver. (to be fair, part of my disappointment was that $1 tacos only include corn tortillas, not flour. I'm a gringo... gimme my damn flour shells).

This past week, I felt it was time to give Sabor a shot a redemption. I'm glad to say I left much happier this time around. I got a shredded chicken, ground beef & a veggie taco (reluctantly on corn tortillas). The chicken is awesome (especially with the pineapple salsa) and the beef is fantastic (especially with their spicy ranch-y style sauce). The veggie taco was just alright, in my honest opinion... nothing special or yummy flavor to it. That whole salsa bar was just better this time,too. The pineapple salsa is great, as is their medium green salsa. We opted for queso & chips again. The queso has a great flavor, but it's basically the consistency of water. I've never seen queso so thin before, it was almost hard to eat without dripping everywhere.

 I must have been in a bad mood last time, because this was a complete 180 experience. I would definitely be back for Taco Tuesday, and definitively to try their 'normal' menu.
