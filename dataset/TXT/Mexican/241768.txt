TCoBE_BkDRrK0bWrh5VueQ When you come here your life is officially complete. Fo'real!  Crazy good vibe, even better people, and yes you guessed it... Even better food. Bar has a great selection of beer/cocktails. And when you come here (its a case of when, not if) stay to the right and go straight to the Al Pastor line . Then grab chorizo. And then shrimp. Then street corn. Then beer. Eat... Drink. And you'll forget all about Donald Trump's crappy hair "thing."
