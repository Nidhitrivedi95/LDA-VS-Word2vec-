Gy_XiWqkJM8JMaKk_sgXOw Called in an order for a cheese crisp.  Got a cold tortilla with cheese that wasn't melted.  Sat down to eat and was chastised by owner for not ordering "for here" on the phone.  He told me my soda would cost $1 more.  I asked why.  He said if you take food to go, you fill up once and leave.  If you sit and eat, you get free refills.  I said, well, it's not free if it costs a dollar more.  Won't come back.
