-qb_3LLSnBcHA6zc8NRSxQ This place was really neat! Has a great Latin themed atmosphere. I really love the bar area! Makes you feel like your in a small dive bar in Mexico. I can't get over the how cool it felt! 

The staff here are beyond great at what they do when it comes to customer service. I felt very welcomed as I was greeted at the door and when I left. 

I came here with a co-worker, who is a regular here. We ordered drinks and ordered food for lunch. We started with a couple draft beers (bud-light). The beer is served in a frosty cold glass, and you and feel a hint of ice crisp when you take the first couple gulps. Very awesome!! For food I ordered the shredded chicken burrito enchilada style with red sauce, also asked them to out the guacamole and sour cream on the inside of the burrito. Let me tell ya! This little concoction was absolutely delicious! 

Everything about this place was good. From the greeting at the door, to the chips and salsa, to the beer, to the cohesion of staff and customers. I will very much so be back for another visit very soon! 

Great job guys and girls.
