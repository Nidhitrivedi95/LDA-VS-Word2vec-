hTSIT3puu8m8-kOZYS4Zdg I LOVE THIS SPOT! I am puerto rican and when i walk into this restaurant the loud salsa and merengue music and ambiance is just great. It's a small restaurant with about 6-7 tables and some outdoor seating as well, but it is truly phenomenal. The meat is seasoned to perfection! I always get a Brother's Burrito with Beef... Party in my mouth. Also, the prices are OUTSTANDING! The fact that you get everything you want (guac included) for one set price of 6.45 or so is just great. When I tried this place all i could say was... Chipotle who??. I paid 23$ for two burritos (great sizes) a side of guac and chips and two coca cola bottles! Awesome price, awesome atmosphere and right in the heart of ohio city! It's great!!
