vdZOiZH9sTseyll44waMuA We've had bad experiences with macayos service in the past. We received a gift certificate from a manager to try the chain again and give them another chance. We chose this location instead of our usual. Our server was awesome, attentive, very friendly and had good suggestions. If you come to this location ask for Ernesto as your server.
