xlXwxfiUD4bgJFKUYwkzOg I went to this place with my wife on the 4th of July, and from the name, I expected some good MEX food.  However, for those that know what real Mexican food tastes like, this place doesn't even come close.  Everything is salty as hell, from the free chips to the stale (small and expensive) shrimp tacos.  I come to this casino a lot, and have always wanted to try the food in this restaurant because of all of the reviews.  However and unfortunately, the food is nothing Close to what can be called authentic.  Not to mention the $$$$.  Definitely a tourist trap.
