333W59XcrXZsJlnBAAx5mQ Food is ok, service is terrible.   Gave this new location another chance becuase a friend wanted to go there,  it was subpar at best.  They hire people who don't care, walk around clueless and laxadasical.   I used to love the old location, I won't go back to the new unless someone insists on going.  When there is a problem, it is always becuase of poor management.  Location is great,  service rates a zero and the food is ok. Taco kissi is way better.
