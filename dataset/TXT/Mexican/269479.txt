woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ If you want mega fancy tacos and interesting tequila cocktails, this is definitely the spot to go. The atmosphere feels very club-like, with a live DJ, the lights down low, and a large crowd. I ordered the octopus tacos, while my dinner pal ordered the duck/foie gras tacos. Both were delicious! I'd never eaten octopus and was pretty surprised when my taco came with full tentacles. The cocktails are fantastic as well; I really liked the watermelon basil margarita. Service was great, even though we were a super late 10:45 reservation. Definitely a good splurge spot.
