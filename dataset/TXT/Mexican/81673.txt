d_L-rfS1vT3JMzgCUGtiow BE CAREFUL WHEN ORDERING TOP SHELF LIQUOR! They mix random bottles of liquor together so for $12 to $15 a drink you aren't getting what you're paying for!  NOT ONLY IS THIS WRONG, IT IS ILLEGAL! 

Border Grill was throwing a bridal event today so I went with my mom. We showed up a little early so we decided to get drinks with guac and chips at the bar while we waited. I ordered a titos vodka with soda & a splash of cranberry. When I tasted it I immediately knew something didn't taste right I told the bartender - who was very polite - and he made me another one, but it tasted the same. I told him again and said, I don't think this is Titos because it tastes like jalapeño or something. So he went to smell the bottle and immediately made a face like WHAT IS THIS?! He asked the other bartender to smell it and when she did she didn't even look the slightest bit shocked. So he opened a new bottle and made me a 3rd drink and it was finally right. So that means they are taking random liquors and pouring them into premium bottles and charging you more for a lower shelf liquor.. While he and the server that brought our chips our guac out were really friendly, I just can't let it go when I pay $25 for two drinks that were not only the wrong liquor they had the nerve to give me a dried our lime wedge, almost totally flat soda, and not to mention the drink was so weak if I didn't see him pour the drink I would have never believed there was vodka in it. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone especially if you're going to drink. Very disappointed.
