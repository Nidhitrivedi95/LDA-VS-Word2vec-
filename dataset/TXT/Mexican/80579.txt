CZhc8YXdFLhAI4ViC2ERTg This place is the real deal. My friend and I came here for dinner because the owner is from Chicago and I heard about the place from Chicagoans in the Desert. It is a new place in a strip mall next to the movie theatre. Can't remember which Mexican place it used to be but the interior is exactly the same. Very cool atmosphere. 

The complimentary chips and salsa they bring you are sooooo good. They also bring you a small plate of spicy grilled jalapeños and they are amazing - a little on the hot side but I love em. 

The menu is HUGE!! If you can't find something to eat here you have issues because they have a little of everything. I ordered two apps - seafood taquitos and 
Nopales. Whaaaaat!! Fresh nopales are quite rare at Mexican places so I always order when I see them on the menu. They are definitely not from a jar. 

The seafood taquitos are decent but not my favorite. Had pieces of baby lobster and shrimp which was tasty. 

My friend ordered combo tacos beef and chicken. She also ordered fresh guacamole which was incredible. 

Back to the nopales. They are served hot win onions and bell peppers. Seasoned nicely. I could have eaten this all week. I took some home and ate them cold the next day - they tasted even better!!!!! My mom used to make them fresh like this so it's sort of nostalgic for me. Nom nom nom!!!

There was also this mariachi walking around and singing some great music. He was so sweet. He came over and talked to us for a while, just a real nice man.  

Come and check this place out!! And get the nopales!!!
