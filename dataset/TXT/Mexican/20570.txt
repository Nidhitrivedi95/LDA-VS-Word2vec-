27OH0hv4jhwKDk-hKgqw_A I just stopped by to get a raspado. The one they made for me was awful. I got a whole bunch of ice, very little of the syrup, and a couple small spoonfuls of fruit. I asked for ice cream as well and got a measly scoop. The fruit was ok, the syrup tasted bad. Not to mention I had found a couple bugs in my drink after trying to figure out what it was I had in my cup. I didn't even finish my drink. Over $12 spent on two raspados for nothing. I won't be coming back. The quality is absolutely disgusting.
