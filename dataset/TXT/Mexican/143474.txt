JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg I went with a group of about 10 people for a birthday dinner. For dinner we all decided to order the medium sized portion meal that serves several people. The food itself was good and there was enough meat and sides to serve everyone generously. Our waiter was very attentive, but I don't think I will be returning for the following reasons: 1. We saw on their website that on Wednesday's it's HALF OFF all tequila drinks, so we ordered several margaritas as a group. When we received our tab, the drinks were not half off. We asked the waiter to correct this and she indicated that it wasn't initially discounted since it's a "secret discount" but it's on their website!! 2. The waiter informed us that each person that checks in on Yelp would receive a FREE flan. The majority of the group checked in and received their free flan (which was delicious). For whatever reason they decided to charge us for each flan on our tab, which we also had to tell her to remove and she did. 3. We had several empty seats in our table and we were done eating, so they asked if they could move us to the bar so another group could occupy our large table. We did not object to this and sat at the bar and continued to order drinks. When we received our tab we noticed that our drinks, tax and gratuity wasn't adding up correctly. After about 20 minutes of my friend going back and fourth with them about fixing the tab the manager had the nerve to ask us if the gratuity was correct??!! Needless to say the tab was fixed, but all the embarrassment could have been avoided if they would just honor the discounts published on their website and not charge for something that they said would be free.
