Bf2fuqWbHd3L-X69FSMvmg Stopped in for a late lunch today, was pleasantly very satisfied! Had fish tacos which each came with 2 tortillas so I could even split them into 2 more each. Ingredients were fresh and tasty, and portion size for the $5 taco made it well worth it. Environment is very casual but service is good - I'd definitely come back here.
