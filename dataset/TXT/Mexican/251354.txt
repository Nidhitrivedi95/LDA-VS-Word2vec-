umxN12ok_qOB4qru0qmx6g So today I went to Taco Del Mar to get something small (Chips and queso with a drink) This Cashier that works there for a while (Brown girl with thick accent) was slow even though I been there a few time, but this time was the last straw. Does not seems like she knows what she is doing even after all this time. Food taste decent, but service is bad. Short lunch break and made me wait for long time (3 person before me took around 20min just to pay (not including making the food time)) Get better employee/ cashier plz. Wait + Cashier attitude made me lost all my appetite
