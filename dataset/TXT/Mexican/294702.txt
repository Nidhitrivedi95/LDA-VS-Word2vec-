z9KxcVoe6tQGyB_Zy0Umcg Although this was truly an experience I'm glad I tried... Mexican Sushi fusion... the outcome definitely left me unsatisfied.
 
To start with the good: 
The atmosphere was clean and the staff was very nice. I'm sure the Mexican food would have been great, but we came with sushi in mind and that's how we found this place on yelp.

Now the cons:
The salsa provided was only green salsa that was watered down. We ordered the MV Roll, Cordon Blue Roll and La Bomba. I love a deep fried roll every once in a while, but the taste was the same with all 3 items... the grease was a good flavor, but the rice covered the taste of all the flavors that would be complimentary, leaving it bland. Although it was very filling, it left my wife and I wanting a different food afterwards. 

To sum it up:
The idea of Mexican Fusion was great, I just feel like it wasn't executed properly. I hope they pay more attention to their salsas and learn to work with the rice more sparingly.
