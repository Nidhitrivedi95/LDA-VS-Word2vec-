g9vzFlunYXagaH5hNkU2Uw I stopped here for lunch on a Thursday in the summer and sat outside. The service was incredibly fast and outstanding! The waitress had my drink and food to me within 5 minutes! They give you chips and two types of salsa as a free app and a minute later your meal is out! I ordered the Vanessa Special off their lunch menu which is rice, salad, and two enchiladas with cheese sauce. DELICIOUS! And very inexpensive, only $5.95! I will definitely be returning to this place!
