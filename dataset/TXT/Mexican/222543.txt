rSiSZlTzHi4Ox_rFHe9CdA I come here every couple of weeks and I think I discovered it's the same place that used to be in Cumberland (just moved and expanded).  I never knew the name of the place under Cumberland...we just called it burrito place in Cumberland.  

From the new location though, I've had:

-Beef burrito 3/5
-Beef tacos  2/5
-Surf and turf burrito bow 2.5/5

The burritos are huge and tasty and the tacos aren't bad.  What I like is that they cook all the food fresh and it tastes much better than the old place under Cumberland. 

I was a bit disappointed by the burrito bowl.  When I order a bowl, I expect it to be in a taco shell bowl (hence the name "burrito bowl").  It wasn't bad, but not what I was expecting, it was just salad with rice with meat.  It'd be more appropriate to call it "burrito platter or taco platter or meat with rice and salad".

I think I'll stick to burritos from this place, but it's nothing special.  Still decent though.
