6Tq13q3Ib17gSgP0zki3EA I'm not a big raspados fan, but my girlfriend is so I took her here. The service was kind of friendly I suppose and it took a long time. I tried some of the pineapple one and it was ok. My girlfriend says she has had better in Vegas cheaper. Her main complaint was that the flavor seemed to disappear much faster than others she has tried.
