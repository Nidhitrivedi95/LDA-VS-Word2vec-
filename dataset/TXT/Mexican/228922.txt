sAu9UJ5tvY6sc9Q_gcVV7Q This is a few days late, but it's here. 
We were here two nights ago and throughly had a great dinners experience. We start out with our waitress bringing us chips and salsa. There were 3 salsas, a red salsa, pico se gallo, and an avocado/tomatillo sauce, al very good and tasty. My husband had a shredded beef burrito with beans and rice. I had the chicken an cheese stuffed tortillas (mini quesadillas) and steak tacos-Oh my the tacos were so good-with rice and charro beans. These charro beans were some of the best restaurant whole pinto beans I've ever had. After dinner our check was brought to us, my husband paid for it and we left. It was getting late so we headed to our hotel. When we got there we did not have our credit card. Panic mode for me-I called the restaurant told them who I was gave the name on the card and it was there. Praise God! My husband was told the waitress tried to chase us down but we were too far ahead of her. I thank you for your honesty and we enjoyed our dinner. Five stars to the restaurant, staff and our great waitress.
