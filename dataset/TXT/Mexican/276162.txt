XfUoM-27iPHkbewPXepmFQ If you want to get sick, eat here!  My family got food poisoning after enjoying a meal from this.  That was after my truck got stuck through the drive-thru, due to the very tight turn they have. Who did they hire to build this place? Is it the same contractor cooking the food?  I will never go back to this place again. I have had so much better service at other locations.  Stay away!
