BQJokxJ4y4s57i7Mn65pvA This was the best meal we had of at least 10 meals on our trip.  Had rolled tacos, chicken enchilada mole, and tableside guac.  Sounds simple but they do it their own way, it was amazing.  And to top it off, the churros with dipping sauces were by far the best I have ever had.  Will be back for sure.
