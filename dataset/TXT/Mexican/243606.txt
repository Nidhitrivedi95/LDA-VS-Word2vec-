thLX_k20SPJ0KyusGTBIHw Been here a few times and they never disappoint. Tried the sweet corn and avocado Caesar salad with shrimp this time and it was delicious. We sat up at the bar with a street view and had exceptional service from Steve the bartender.  I definitely recommend coming here for lunch or late night just before heading out to the bars in downtown.
