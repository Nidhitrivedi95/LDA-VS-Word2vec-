VRwT0pscR5vESCrAnUpNwQ I think this may be my favourite taco place in the city. The atmosphere, the options, the SALSA AND HOT SAUCE BAR are absolutely amazing! 
They cover all the bases you would want in a Mexican eatery. The decor is chic and modern yet still comfortable. You likely won't stay long as it's not a table service environment and the place is pretty packed, but you'll be satisfied. 

Did I mention the SALSA AND HOT SAUCE BAR?!?!

This place is a spice lovers dream. And with so much variety in sauces and additions you can customize your tacos, quesadillas etc. This is a really welcome aspect when you look at other taco places in the city that are strict on no substitutions and want you to eat it only the way they made it. 

Give this place a try for sure!
