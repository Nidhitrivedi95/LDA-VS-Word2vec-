Eis_z-uF_2gUf83UE9blog Came in for dinner and it was not super busy, which was a plus. I decided to eat a burrito enchilada style with grilled chicken. One of the best burritos ever! The size was just as big as Chipotle's burrito, but it tastes more authentic. 
The service was just as good too. While eating, one of the employees made sure I was doing alright, which is not something I'm used to eating at a fast food/quick service place. Also, seeing the manager working with his other employees up front in the serving station shows a lot about how much the company cares for their employees and customers. This location is also good because it is right next to a Yogurtland to fulfill my sweet craving.
Overall, I will definitely come back!
