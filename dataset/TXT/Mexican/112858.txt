gaR5jDvZsOC0RQeY-W1eqQ Well, since moving the resteraunt I have definitly noticed the service and quality of food has slipped.

We just waited over a half an hour for our lunch. The service was spotty and I noticed that the same item I ordered in the past came noticeably smaller and with out hardly any sides. I had to actually order and pay extra for sour cream, seriously? Many other customers were waiting long periods of time for their food as well and were visibly upset with the server and management.

I think I am done with Mas-Amigos for the time being. They have major management issues and kitchen problems.
