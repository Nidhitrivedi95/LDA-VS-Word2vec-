SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA Holy cow I finally found a great Mexican place in Las Vegas! I have been on the hunt since we moved from California & I'm happy to say the search is over. Excellent food & excellent service. Such great service we tipped our waiter, Omar, quite well. I don't mess around when it comes to something I love! 
Since finding this gem we go about once a week for dinner. Fajitas are huge and delicious, the fish tacos are great & the Margaritas are amazing. Plus all the staff are friendly. Try this place out, you won't be disappointed.
