aWYWNfHuQJyRwDHaHq8X1w I never met a taco I didn't like at Tex Tubb's until this week & I'm super sad! :( 

It appears that they've made some changes to the menu and a bunch of my favorites are gone, including the Hot Mama, Puerco Meatball, one of the fish options, and another of the ones that included pineapple-soda marinated meat. I think the cool Mexican sandwiches are gone, too. Our guacamole was flavorless & kind of watery?! I tried two new additions--the tequila lime shrimp taco & brisket taco and both were underwhelming. 

Say it ain't so, Tex Tubb's! Bring back the good stuff!
