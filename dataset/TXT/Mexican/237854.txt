SXWLhxdcFCLPnF7AlFbg4g Great food. Mediocre service. The waitress forgot our drink order and we waited about 15 minutes before having to remind her about it. The food was fantastic and generous in terms of serving size. Don't understand the complaints from others about the portions. Everyone we saw either couldn't finish their meals or were taking the rest home. We went on a Saturday night. It was very very busy. Will definitly return
