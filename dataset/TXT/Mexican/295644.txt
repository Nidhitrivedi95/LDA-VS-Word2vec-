ZcAoKSDT6BNcWsn3o4-WVA I've been here three times now (all for Tuesday night trivia). Overall everything has been quite positive: The tap beer selection is plentiful and diverse, the trivia (Tuesdays) is entertaining and competitive. The decor and ambiance works... it's got the tex-mex type flair but in a tasteful way. You'll see. My wife and I regularly decide to get the nachos which have yet to disappoint. I am telling you - get the half order only. Seriously, the half order is PLENTY and you would easily be able to share it amongst four people. 
Yes, the half order can and should feed four. 
We did have one instance of shotty service - the waiter was awkward, ignored us for a portion of the night and we ended up reaching out to another staff there to get our last round of drinks and then pay our tab. Other than that we've been pleased. I certainly intend to go back.
