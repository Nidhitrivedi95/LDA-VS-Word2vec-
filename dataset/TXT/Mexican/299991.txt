zMdpFu7hpvrHChR7H2XCfA I am a Cozumel junkie. I love this place so much, it's my go-to when I don't feel like cooking. What's not to like? Cozumel is fairly inexpensive, super quick service and delicious Mexican food. I have been here so many times it's hard for me to recommend specific dishes but I can say I usually chose the enchiladas, fajitas or quesadillas. It's your typical Mexican joint and they serve many different combination platters, including an extensive vegetarian menu. After being seated you are automatically presented with fresh chips and salsa (oooo... hot tortilla chips...) and they are BOTTOMLESS. You don't have much time to fill up on them before your food is arriving. They are really fast! Cozumel also serve a big selection of Mexican beers and the margaritas are as big as your head.  

Tip: Don't be afraid to deviate from the normal and try their daily specials. We have never been less than pleased!
