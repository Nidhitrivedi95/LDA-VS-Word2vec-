QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA If I could give this place a -5 I would. I was excited to check this place out. I am here and I am excited to leave. 
-Soggy grease tacos that fall apart when you pick them up. 
-poor service...I was never asked for another beer ( I had one)
-don't ask for a sports event that is not on a national tv channel, they don't have any sports packages. 
-I had to ask for a fork
-our table was dirty and the bartender threw my date a rag to clean the spilled food and liquid from the last party. 

This place is a dump. They must write their own reviews as warned by Yelp...STAY AWAY.
