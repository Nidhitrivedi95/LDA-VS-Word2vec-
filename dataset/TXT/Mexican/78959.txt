CrwL7Y-jdzno4mmV7CN67A The staff is very friendly, and the service is great.  The food is all made from scratch! From the tortillas to the mole.  I wanted a chile relleno burrito, and although not on the menu, they made me one.  And ooooooh wow! It was the best chile relleno burrito that I have ever had.  It came with some grilled onions, and a roasted jalapeno on the side.  I enjoyed them with the burro.  I was also given a sample of the molè. It paired so perfect with the burrito. I think ill be going back for dinner, and having the same meal, but this time enchilada style with the mole sauce.
