qUqmTlchliF55jF7s4Xlmw So I know Chipotle has gotten a bad wrap in the news lately, but it's always been good to me. This location is pretty clean and quick, so no complaints there. 

The thing I like about Chipotle is that you always know what you get with them. I got the chicken bowl and asked for a wrap on the side, which is complimentary. The chicken, sides, and salsa are always fresh. 

Sadly, the chips were a little on the stale side tonight. This is usually not an issue so I won't go on about it. 

4 stars Guac is extra. 

But still Chipotle is better than Moes
