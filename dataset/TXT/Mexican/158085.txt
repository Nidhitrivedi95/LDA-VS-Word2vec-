knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw As an out-of-towner, this place was perfect for a dinner and pre-game right before the Cavs game!! I loved the bacon and mango guacamole to start, and the margaritas at happy hour are $5 and taste great! I ordered the chicken salad taco which was good- savory with sweet elements. I also ordered the papas fritas chorizo taco. It tasted great but was missing greens, it was just meat cheese and potatoes. Of course the best part for me was the vast selection of tequilas! A quick shot before the game and you're great! You can choose from the house $6 brands up to the $250 anniversary José... I stayed on the cheaper side though with Patron Silver and got their house made Sangrita mix to chase- Delish!!
