VXlK-DWw4ADR4TE7Eou5Dg Food was alright but, as others have mentioned, overpriced.

Unfortunately, the service was really disappointing. We were two couples, one with a baby in a baby-basket thingy (obviously I'm no parent). Staff were rude to them as they tried to find a spot for the wee one. I realize space is limited but they really didn't have to be so rude about it. Otherwise, staff were apathetic towards us in general.

I've been here a few times over the years and this visit was definitely the last one. There are SO MANY better options for mexican food in the city. Which is a shame because they're in a good location.
