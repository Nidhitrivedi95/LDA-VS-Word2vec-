thLX_k20SPJ0KyusGTBIHw Decided to try this place out on a Monday around 5:30p. I train service dogs and I checked reviews on Yelp prior to going in and noticed that they were very ANTI-SERVICE ANIMAL. Unfortunately, I found this to be true. When I arrived, I went to the hostess stand and immediately the hostess told me "Uhhh there's no dogs allowed here." I got no welcome or smile when I arrived. I kindly told her that the dog was a service animal and again I got the "uhhhhhhhhh we don't allow dogs." My dog was wearing a vest that clearly said SERVICE DOG on one side & IN TRAINING on the other. The bartender stepped in and told her service animals are OK. I was sat on the patio. I ordered a drink, chips and guac and sat for about 20min until the manager came out and told me that I had to leave because the dog was in training. DO NOT COME HERE WITH A SERVICE ANIMAL! I'm so sad that we got kicked out?!?!?! I loved my server and the bartender was so friendly but they are not service dog friendly. Obviously, we will not be returning.
