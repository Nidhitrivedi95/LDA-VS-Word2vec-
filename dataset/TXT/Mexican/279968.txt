I came in to pick up lunch for my family and every single employee down the line of getting the meals prepared had an unfriendly attitude and demeanor about them. Not only that, but they forget to put two sides I ordered in my bag upon checking out.

It's unfortunate, because I have enjoyed Cafe Rio at other locations before, but I probably have no intention of visiting this one again.
