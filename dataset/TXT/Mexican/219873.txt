RHoFn4B0AfyqyWGYFqeSXA For a quick Mexican food fix, this is the place, y'all. I've had the chicken chimichanga, carne asada chimichanga, cheese quesadilla and a basic bean burrito. All were muy bueno (that means very good, by the way. You're welcome.)

The inside is clean but really small. There are only a few tables so it can get crowded if you go at peak times but I've also been there at dinner time and it was pretty empty so it's just hit and miss as far as the crowd. I normally go through the drive through where they have a huge menu board complete with pictures for most items (good for gringas like me who aren't super knowledgable about Mexican food). 

The chimichangas (my personal favorite menu item) are solidly on point. They're nice and crisply fried on the outside but slightly soft on the inside and filled with all sorts of goodness. The carne asada is almost always cooked perfectly (full disclosure: I have had it once or twice when it wasn't all that great-I chalked it up to an off night for the cook). They do the chimis up full scale with sour cream, guacamole and cheese on top and pair it with some awesome refried beans and rice. It's easily enough for 2 or 3 meals for me. 

The location is almost hidden but it's just off Water Street across from the Henderson Detention Center. If you didn't know it was there, you'd never guess cause it's sort of away from all the surrounding businesses in downtown Henderson. 

I think it's just as good, if not better, than Roberto's or Faustos and the prices are lower than both. Give this hidden gem a try! You won't be disappointed! Adios amigos!
