1_y5e1u-o93EKOigXgR3LQ Wow!  Tofu tacos were of the chain!! I will not be trying any other variety protein tacos they offer since I'm a vegetarian, but honestly you don't need to.  It was very fresh and flavourful.  A little to much sambal sweet Thai chilli sauce and really no need for the crema which I will nix next time.  This is my new go to spot instead of burrito boys...sorry but not sorry. Even on a long weekend in Port credit it was nice to find a spot away from the crowds and the heat. Will definitely be back! Also,very nice service the gentleman behind the counter was very nice and quick.  Thank you
