d_q4avZYM1sOlQP7noJKVg Was super excited to try this place out considering the fact that earlier in the day a Phoenix local mentioned the food was as great as the locations in Tucson which my buddy that's in the Air Force raves about. Went to try it and The food was ok. As far as food goes, the hot dog sonorense bun tasted microwaved, the large caramelo was a quesadilla with beans which I love quesadillas and it met expectations. Overall food was a 8/10 in my opinion. The staff seems to be too young with no leadership or any sense of responsibility. One of the employees went to grab a plate to stack condiments, ended up making a mess of the plates and didn't seem to care as he left it like that. He then Sat down to take a break and was being louder than an average person. The guys in the kitchen had much more enthusiasm than the average person dealing with customers. Guero better make some changes to the staff he has running his joint or it might not be as successful as his other spots
