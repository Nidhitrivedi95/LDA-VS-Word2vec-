CHFw_V836nIKpWtqMP4E5g Absolutely love this Mexican restaurant. Would recommend this one over any other within the area. As soon as you get seated you get a large bowl of fresh salsa and warm Tortilla chips to snack on. Our waiter was quick throughout the whole night which was excellent for it being so packed. As soon as we put in our orders they arrived at our table in about 15 minutes at most. I ordered the chicken fajitas which came with a hot sizzling cast iron pan filled to the brim with the fajitas along with a huge plate full of toppings such as rice, refried beans, guac, sour cream, lettuce, pico de gallo, and 3 tortilla shells. What sets this restaurant's from others is they are not skimpy and they added mushrooms, onions, an assortment of different colored peppers, and broccoli in their recipe. If you need more shells which you probably will since the meal is huge they give them to you at no extra cost which I think is great. My boyfriend ordered the burrito grande which is also a giant portion. He says it is the best burrito you'll ever eat. It was loaded with steak (also have the option for chicken), refried beans, lettuce, rice, guac, and sour cream. Overall great experience and I highly recommend.
