IoyamGmKao_hfQBvFKihyA Fiance and I visited on Sunday, Mother's Day, we were greeted warmly by the hostess and seated almost immediately.  We visit here often as the food is delicious, they have a salsa bar, and within minutes of being seated, warm chips and salsa are brought to your table. Another reason and probably the biggest reason we enjoy coming here is because of a wonderful waitress, Hasmik.  We always ask to be seated in her area because she is cheerful, knowledgeable about the menu and is attentive to her customers. She always brings a pitcher of tea to our table, which I enjoy. My fiance had the Enchiladas Suizas and I had the chicken Fajitas.  Now here I always have a small issue, with this large platter of fajitas, they bring a very small, Trio Bowl of garnishments, guacamole, sour cream and salsa. For the large portion of fajitas, the garnishments are never enough unless you put a very small dot on each taco you make.  On this evening, Room Manager Jerome Martinez was working in the restaurant and he was making his rounds of the tables asking customers about their experience, how was the food, etc.  As he came to our table I decided to ask him why the small garnishment bowl.  He took the time to explain that, corporate and not the restaurant dictated portion control on their dishes.  I did tell him that the size difference was unlike other restaurants but that I was satisfied with his answer.  He did offer to bring me a side order of guacamole which I declined.  While speaking with Hasmik about grandchildren and customer service issues at another local restaurant, Mgr. Martinez, came up and placed a side order of guacamole on our table. Wow! This I did not expect. Well needless to say, we felt that Mgr Martinez, in his own quiet way, went above and beyond to make a customer happier.  We will continue to patronize Amigos, not only for their good food but because of their awesome employees Mgr. Martinez and Hasmik.
