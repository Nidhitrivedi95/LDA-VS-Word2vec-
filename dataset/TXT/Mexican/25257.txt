3-aEgS7X2jrbxA7sA1nARw My friend and I wandered in here looking for lunch. The place was absolutely empty and the decor is very much night club.  I was hesitant to stay and order but my friend insisted. I'm so glad I listened to her. Lunch was delicious. I had three tacos (chicken, beef & pork) ordered a la cart.  My friend had queso blanco enchiladas. The food was fresh and flavorful. We were both absolutely thrilled with our lunches. 
Service was attentive(duh, we were the only people there) and very friendly.  
I would definitely come back to try more of the menu.
