JIfSollg32ifUzTw2K4PDQ My entire life I have refused to eat Mexican food do to the consistent raw hot inflated bowel movements. But one night I decided to try some street tacos at this food truck that seems to always be open. I tried pork beef chicken and I made a very rare discovery. That street tacos so authentic and so she can taste so amazing. I have never had Mexican food that left me satisfied full grateful and without an upset stomach. I refuse to eat anywhere else I will travel across town if I have to. I brag that this food truck has changed the Mexican food game for me and if I do happen to eat somewhere else I'm always comparing the food to theirs and everyone always loses. The rice milk is on point. In cold weather there is a space heater. There are always cold drinks and very good customer service.

Do I recommend this food truck ? Hell mother bleeping bleep I do!!!
