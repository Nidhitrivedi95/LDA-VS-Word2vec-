vCcnawY4Q41A1rlnxKBzkA A little hole in the wall that is a diamond in the rough. Last night we had a chicken burrito, beef burrito, and beef tostada with a drink for under $20. The service was quick, the staff was friendly (and a little sarcastic), and everything we ate couldn't have been better.

If you're looking for great Mexican food, go here. I will be returning and bringing anyone who visits me here as well!
