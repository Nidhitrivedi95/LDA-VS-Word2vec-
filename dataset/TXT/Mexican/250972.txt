ulvhY9bckuDWF8qey_yM9Q I love Mexican food, so it's my mission to check out the Filiberto's, Poliberto's, Ramiro's etc of Phoenix and I can't stand when I go to the ones that are just okay. On my first visit, I had a Chicken Chimichunga combo meal and it was relatively good. I'd go so far as to give it 4 stars, based on that visit. Then today I returned to try their breakfast burritos. I decided on a bacon, egg and cheese burrito and added potatoes and onions. The cost of this was $7.30, which is a little pricey for a breakfast burrito, but not ridiculously so. The bacon was not cooked or crispy, but just like it comes out of a bag of crumbled bacon from Costco. Cold and flimsy. The potatoes were completely raw and talk about tasteless. Very. very disappointing.
Now, this restaurant only recently opened up, but I would encourage the owners to visit their competitor, Ramiro's, at 43rd Avenue and Bell and taste every darn thing on their menu. It is absolutely the best in the Phoenix Metro area. Best tacos, best everything, except the red sauce. There are at least 3 restaurants in their vicinity and they have a lot to learn if they want to compete with the others.
