XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg We stopped here because we wanted breakfast. I was immediately pleased by the pleasant and 'quick to please' wait staff. The servers make sure your drinks never go empty or even half full. I ordered spicy scramble which comes with ham and biscuits. I also ordered the Shrimp tamale appetizer which was so savory and had the best sauce; so delicious I could drink it. I've never heard of hominy grits, but I was raised eating hominy... this is so good, it reminds me of my happy childhood breakfasts with my grandmother. The bread basket was filled with sweet and spicy bite size treats. Wonderful! Very pleased.
