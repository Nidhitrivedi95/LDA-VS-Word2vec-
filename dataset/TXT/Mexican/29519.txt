42TGx8KatGNPCi7rwOzazg We drove all the way from downtown Charlotte to eat at this place because of good reviews this was our first time here. We asked to be sat in the bar area where there was one other couple due to the main restaurant was busy & full. The hostess was very rude and inattentive meanwhile walking through the restaurant sipping on a Chick Fil A drink. 

After the hostess sat us we were unaware of who would be serving us as the hostess laid the menus down and walked off. The bartender is who was suppose to be serving us as we say there for 15 minutes without someone coming to the table with water or to tell us it would be a few minutes before someone would be able to wait on us. During that wait I got up twice to ask the hostess if there would be someone waiting on us that is when she went over and told the bartender and he told her he made hand gestures as if he didn't want to wait on us. So then proceeded to walk through again without coming and informing us that it would be an even longer wait. 

Finally after all that I walked back up to the hostess station to ask her could we just move to the main area where people were being served properly and waited on she was reluctant to answer and as we stood there in silence I asked "are we suppose to seat ourselves?" She said "YEA" !!!
I then asked could I speak to a manager and she laughed and rudely stated "oh, he's out of town" and there will not be a manager to assist us. 

This by far was the worst customer service in a restaurant I've ever experienced and the rudest bartender and hostess. I will not recommend this restaurant to people and will definitely tell my dental colleagues in the area not to go to this place.
