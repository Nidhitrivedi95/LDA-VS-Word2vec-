rCJ6qFo_liwGPzbupkLhhQ La piñata and I go back 20+ years. I was faster and leaner and dark family Mexican places with great Sonoran food and Frozen Margaritas with freshly fried chips and chunky salsa was just the ticket on the west side. I'm older and not so lean anymore and so is La Piñata. They still have good "gringo" food and I still like it. It's hard to say whether La Piñata and I are worn out or just comfortable, but I'm going to keep coming
