T5UBAJt5Kod_wQGbH6m9hA I stopped in here because I've heard a few people talk about the great seafood they have and it has a great yelp review. I sat with my daughter and chips and salsa were dropped right away. I ordered two waters waited 15 mins and finally asked the lady walking by if somebody would please take my order. She responded yes and walked away, needless to say I got up and left. I did however get a balloon flower for my daughter while I was waiting so only one of us left unhappy. I've worked in the service industry for 20 years and I understand busy, but when Im watching some of the girls texting on their phones instead of working it's unacceptable.
