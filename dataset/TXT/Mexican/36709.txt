5l-yKN13VwfPwuSiBIqdJQ I told my boyfriend to just bring me back something when he was out, he knew I was on a cheeseburger kick, so he brought me a bacon cheeseburger and fries from Farmer Boys .
This cheeseburger was pretty damn good .
The fries were good as well .
Oddly enough, my favorite was the ranch .
It's not easy to find good ranch around .
I'll def be needing another visit next time I go to Vegas !
