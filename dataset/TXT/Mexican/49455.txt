8nNB_yG1gzVpbqNH2EBucg I had not been to a Z'Tejas in about 15 years. I was a little surprised that they no longer provide the complimentary cornbread with meals. You can still order it and pay for it (the proceeds go to charity). Instead they bring some thick, cold corn chips with a brown sauce (tastes like a smoked chipolte pureed sauce, not a chunky, fresh Mexican food salsa). My friend and I tried it are not fans of the flavor profile. In the future I need to remember to ask them to not bother bringing this stuff to the table.

I had grilled ruby trout salad with seasoned walnuts, a small blob of feta cheese, mixed greens, and a flavorful dressing. The trout was very good and the overall salad was excellent. The price was $14 which I thought was about twice what it was worth. My friend had the mushroom enchiladas and stated that they were very good ($10).

Service was very good and the food arrived in a timely manner. There are both tables and booths and the noise level is not too bad (normal conversation can be carried on). The restaurant looked clean. It was a pretty typical look and feel for this chain.

Parking is plentiful and the disabled parking is close to the door for the mobility impaired.
