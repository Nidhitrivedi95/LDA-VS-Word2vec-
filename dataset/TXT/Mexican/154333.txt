K-uQkfSUTwu5LIwPB4b_vg Went here on vacation. It's dark inside, to the point the servers use pen lights to show you the food (I guess that is on purpose?). Margarita was boss, avacado, made from scratch. Tableside guacamole and salsa was ridiculous, my favorite salsa ever..i ate a chip off of the ground it was so good.  I had the chorizo porchetta, which was honestly the best damn thing I have ever eaten. I imagine it is the gustatory equivalent of watching Jesus do the Carlton. Seriously. Umami...say it with me: 
U-M-A-M-I.
