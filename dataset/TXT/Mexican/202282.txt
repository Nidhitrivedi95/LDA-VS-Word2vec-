POgTu9ieZzOBafGMJ0MZow This is probably the best Mexican food I've eaten in the Cleveland area. I think most places have poorly seasoned chicken and beef/steak in their dishes, but not this place. The flavors really set it apart from other Mexican restaurants around here. It's worth the drive from Cleveland. Service was friendly, fast and the decor is fun. I recommend the chimichangas!
