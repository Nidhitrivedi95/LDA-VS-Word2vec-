fbQaKW0Lte0JQ_opbnjdKg Stopped here while in Phoenix for work and it was so good I came back the next day. It's basically a build your own enchiladas place. You pick everything from your tortilla type to all the fillings then they toss it in the oven so it gets all bubbly and delicious too it with whatever else you want and you are on your way. I highly recommend added the potatoes or the corn bread to whatever meat you choose for your enchiladas.
