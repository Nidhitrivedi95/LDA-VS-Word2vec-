Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ I recently celebrated my birthday at this restaurant and it was GREAT! They truly serve authentic Mexican food, it was delicious. Our server was fun and attentive. I recommended to everyone. The two girl hostess in the front were kind of rude until a very nice gentle men came and finally got us a table. Other than that everything was great.
