hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg Been wanting to go here for a while, so I am somewhat disappointed that it didn't exceed my expectations. We started with the lobster poutine. It was good except for the bits of lobster shell in it.  We also ordered the lobster risotto which was good but nothing special. Again this had bits of lobster shell.  The sous vide short ribs were good but then again not blown away. This had a small bit of bone attached to one of the ribs. Unpleasant surprise while chewing but considering the other 2 courses had unpleasant bits in them as well it shouldn't have come as a surprise.  
Overall I wouldn't recommend it as there are plenty of other restaurants in Montreal that Id rather try than come back here again.
