426RL7G7oTyu-f8jFxVRJQ So I am not from Arizona, but I have been to the chipotle at home a handful of times. I have never been OVERLY impressed with the food, but I thought I would give it another try because so many people love it and its supposed to be a healthier option. I went by this location today at lunch and it was pretty packed. I got my food quickly and had no problems. The employees were friendly and I was in and out of there in less than 2 minutes. I got a chicken and rice bowl which was better than the ones I have had in the past. The reason for 2 stars is because I also got chips and salsa with my bowl, and was very disappointed. I didn't look at the receipt to see how much I paid for the chips & salsa (my meal was $11.06 or something close to that), but they literally gave me maybe a half of a scoop of chips. They fold the bags to make it look like the bag is at least half full of chips but its not. I probably paid $3-4 for literally 10 chips, no joke. If I would have looked in the bag before I left I would have asked for more, but I was already home when I realized it. Seriously Chipotle? Chips are cheapppp and you make huge batches at once. Don't be skimpy on the chips - thats just annoying.
