h4Q-uSoOIhMoIsOhat6l3A AMAZING!!!  I was here for lunch with my boyfriend and son, had a wonderful experience our waiter Juan was a lot of fun and lively! We had the mojarra frita and a wet burrito the green sauce was so delicious and the fish was exceptional. They even gave my son a free noodle soup which he devoured not to mention the homemade chips and salsa. I'll definitely be back and soon
