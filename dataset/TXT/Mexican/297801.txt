Zf1vIlxXnqNYpfSDbT8MnA An average Mexican restaurant. 
We had tacos and sopes. The el pastor doesn't have pineapple in them which is strange to me. The pork was dry and tender, tasted like fried than grilled. The sope with pulled beef was new to me, and it turned out very good.  
The grill is something like Mexican Fajita but with two grilled cheese pita included. The meat was not dry. I like it. 
The price range is a little bit higher than other places. The location is at the end of Cresent street but not as busy as other restaurants. They don't provide lemons, complimentary chips and kinds of salsas like other Mexican restaurants do.
