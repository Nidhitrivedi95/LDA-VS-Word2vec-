xceERetY6Q9Pu_BQ32xpeA Worst worst thing you could ever eat - to start, I always look at Yelp reviews before I eat anywhere. For some reason, I don't do this at airports. But I'll never forget to do this again. 

So I'm trying to find my gate, and I need to eat lunch before a cross country flight, so I see this place and think how bad could it be. $8.99 for a chicken burrito doesn't seem too excessive. While I'm looking around to make sure I'm in the right gate, the cashier asks if I want things like salsa, cheese, beans in my burrito. I say sure cause why not. I hand him my card, and didn't realize until I got the receipt that the burrito came out  to $17 with tax.

Besides being shocked at the price, and realizing everything was at least $1.50 extra, I figure I'll be full because it will be a huge great burrito.

Sadly I was wrong, and this was the worst burrito I've ever had. The tortilla was definitely microwaved and extremely soggy, the chicken had no flavor, there was like 3 beans in the whole thing, barely any salsa. It was so so so bad that I couldn't eat more than half any threw it away. 

Just go over to Wendy's a couple places down, spend less than half the price, and have a great meal.
