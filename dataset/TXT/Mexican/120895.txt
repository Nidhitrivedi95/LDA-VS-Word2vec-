H-PHxkHgehukPQgb3yF9Xw My husband and I couldn't decide where to have lunch, then I remembered my daughter mentioned this place and said we had to try it.
Wow, I'm really glad we listened to her.
When we entered we were greeted with a hello and a smile, and when the gentleman noticed we were having a hard time deciding he made a recommendation for the special of the day. 
We had the enchilada platter special, I had 1 beef and 1 chicken enchilada and it came with rice, black beans, salsa, cheese and sour cream. I was so satisfied with the flavors and the size of the portions, the price is on the high side of average.
Totally would recommend this place and Definitely going to go back.
