zWKpPyzm0W9N5OEPDuwgMA What the heck are all you guys raving about? This place is okay.. Meat is tender that's about it. Tacos lack flavor and heat.. Two major parts.. I don't know what food you are comparing this to. I read lots of good yelps so decided to try this place. Had it the first time and thought it was a little bland. Now just took my girl here and got a few things to try more on menu.  And all I can say it was not gross but far from a good taco let alone best in phx
