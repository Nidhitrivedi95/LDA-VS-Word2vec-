TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag after reading the rave reviews here on yelp and in search of a delicious authentic taco, my fiancé and i headed here for lunch today. 

the store itself is interesting and has some neat things. the people are friendly and there is a lot of parking available in the lot on the side. 

the food: i ordered two carnitas (my favorite) and one pollo. my fiancé ordered one pollo, carnitas and chorizo. i loved that they come bare and you add as many onions, cilantro and sauces as you please. to drink, i got a mandarin jarritos and he got a sprite. our food was ready in minutes and we decided to sit in the eating area. i was really excited for authentic carnitas and while the flavor was good, they were SO DRY. i had to put a ton of sauce and lime on them in order to chew through the tough meat. that was super disappointing, but i quickly forgot all about it once i tasted the chicken. it is AMAZING! juicy, tender and super flavorful. my fiancé agreed about the carnitas but thoroughly enjoyed his other tacos. 

before leaving, we browsed the store and found some really great wine deals and some interesting beers we've never had, which we bought. 

all in all, we will absolutely be back! the women who work here are really nice which is refreshing. i can't wait to try the other tacos and i always look forward to treating myself with a jarritos!
