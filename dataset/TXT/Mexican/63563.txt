b-0q4xbL6EWYUqnwqcYM4Q This particular location is my go-to place for Mexican food. I've been going to this place for years! The food is good, and the waitstaff is friendly. Rarely do they mess up an order (which is limited to the newest staff most times) and if they do, they are quick to correct it. This restaurant is my absolute fave and Azteca can't even touch it. Those who think Taco Bell is actually Mexican food will not like this place, as it is nothing like it. 

I've had nearly everything on the menu and it is always good. The Chimichangas are tasty, steak is generally good, and their specialty dishes are awesome. I stay away from the shrimp as it is usually overcooked (but I'm pretty picky and won't eat seafood at a restaurant -- mostly because I can cook it better at home). Fajitas are good for a casual date. Margaritas are meh, but the Sangria is the best! Great place for lunch, a casual date, or just an inexpensive night out.
