4DLsC4BTUoEqFGusetQVlQ Amazing. Simply amazing. The food was DELICIOUS. I basically majored in Mexican food and the creative tacos are savory and fresh. I drank a "Who got ya?" and had the Mexican corn, and a bunch of tacos off the menu. The waitress, Chelsea, was super cool and helped us out with everything! The atmosphere was friendly, the prices aren't too bad and the service was awesome. Highly recommend and after your meal, you can go to Sweet Jesus for deserts (they connect in the back)..
