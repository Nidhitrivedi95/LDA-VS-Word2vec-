a8pmtlVKf7NiSLI-4KejIw Rule #1, if the place is packed it must be good!!! Well after reading reviews at Yelp of course! 

We had few tapas and the entries were all amazing. The dishes were pretty close to real deal Mexican plates. The chef was born in Mexico and that explains a lot. 

The drinks make you crave for more! I had the Mayan Margarita (with Tamarindo juice OMG).

The place is ideal for groups, family, kids. Not sure about pets. You can make reservations or just walk in. The servers were very attentive and did not put the orders all together which let you enjoy what you were eating and your company as well. 

Even if you are not craving Mexican food you should stop here. You will not regret it!
