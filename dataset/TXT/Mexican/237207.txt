SW6ZQk22G1_CV81_gfnvNQ Came here for dinner the other day 

Pros 
For such a busy place service was fairly quick. 

Cons
Tacos were overpriced for such small portions, I ended up spending $50 + and wasn't satiated. 

Tables were very close together and uncomfortable. (picture your elementary school cafeteria) 

Drinks were sub-par yet started at $10.


Wouldn't recommend
