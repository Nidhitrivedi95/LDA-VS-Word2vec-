h-Oq86DZfZad9kKXe8m7Lg LOS REYES THE LA TORTA OPENED UP A LOCATION IN TEMPE AND IT IS AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL!!!
Tempe just hit the jack pot, growing up in north Phoenix I loved Los Reyes and I was happy to see that they opened one up here, I was a bit skeptical to try it since I thought it would lose its authenticity but it is even better tasting and the location surpasses the original by a lot! Very great authentic tortas from Mexico City with a great environment and even the other menu items other than tortas are great, one of the best original Mexican food places in Tempe that contain real Mexican foods!
