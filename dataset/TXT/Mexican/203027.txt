pomGBqfbxcqPv14c3XH-ZQ I live 5 minutes from this place and I've never tried it before tonight. Man, have I been missing out. We came the right night. Monday is all you can eat street tacos. They have 2 options, $15 for beef, chicken and pork (5 options) and $20 for those plus seafood ones (8 or 9 options). We got the cheaper one to try because we were unsure of how good they were. They were great! They were stuffed with meat (not skimpy at all) with onions and cilantro and they give you some guacamole, limes and some come with sauces to put on them. 
They also have happy hour from 2-6 and have a bunch of small plates for $3 and $5. We tried the shrimp ceviche and cochinita pibil that were both $3. They were pretty good too. They also give you chips with different salsas and refried beans. Your first check-in, you can get a free margarita. If you go during happy hour tho, you can get one for $5 and they're a pretty good size. 
If I remember right, their specials are:
Monday- Ayce street tacos
Tuesday- buy one get one margaritas
Wednesday- 50% off wine
Thursday- kids eat free
