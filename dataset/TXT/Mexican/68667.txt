bMSiHjs2fbKbBNPyuTwhHA I've lived in the Flats for over a dozen years.  It never really died, it's probably just that you stopped coming around (or your parents told you to stay anyway). But now that "the Flats are back" we have places again to hang out at and relax on the water.  One of those places is Costal Taco, and now that it is open for lunch I texted a friend and walked over to check it out.

There was a modest crowd during lunch, unlike weekends where it seems to be packed.  The atmosphere was a unique mix of a sea side restaurant and country club.  The patio is amazing, and immediately brought back memories of spending afternoons at Fadó.  Each table has an umbrella, so despite the fact that it was overcast for most of the lunch hour when the sun did poke out we were covered.

The menu is fairly straight forward.  They have tacos, sides, and a bowl or two.  You pick what you want, fill out the form with your name and the count of each item you want and they cook it.  They say they serve "family style" but this isn't like an Italian dinner.  It just means they merge everyone's order onto a single plate and you have to hunt for what you ordered once it arrives.

The actual tacos were good, but small.  3 steak tacos cost over $10 and were half the size of a taco you could get elsewhere, which is ok because I could stand to lose a few pounds but if you are really craving tacos you may not want to rule out a run for the border (or your favorite local taco joint)

Aside from this there were a few activities to keep you busy while waiting for food or mingling with the opposite sex.  Table tennis, cornhole and giant jenga were just a few of the games I saw about.

Overall, I liked.  Portions small, atmosphere excellent, great to finally sit back out on a patio in my neighborhood.
