fK1oj0dk9Bc6KsBk5mMDxg Went on a Thursday evening for dinner, and they were booked with reservations for tables. That's a good sign for the food. Luckily, they have a fair amount of bar seating.

We ordered a starter of guacamole and salsa with tortilla chips. For meal, we got the Pescados (Fish) tacos, and the Kalbi Beef tacos. All of the food was fantastic.

Service was good, the staff were friendly. We plan to bring friends with us next time and call ahead for a table before we do.
