XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg I just had a work dinner here and the food was amazing. I'm vegan and they did not have anything on the menu, but the server was very accommodating. I had the Chile Relleno with mixed vegetables and rice. It had great flavor and it had just the right amount of spice. If you're vegan don't shy away! :D
