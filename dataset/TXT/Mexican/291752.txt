The guacamole with goat cheese in it was very good but may not be for everyone. The Taco Vampario is delicious!  Lots of great flavor and cooked to perfection.  The taco Buffalado was good but didn't have the flavor hat the others did.  I also got the Goat Cheese Enchiladas with Carnitas on top and it was very, very good! The salsa verda is the best I've ever had!   My husband got the wet steak burrito with seasoned corn as one of his sides and loved it!  

If you prefer average cheap Mexican restaurants this probably won't appeal to you due to the price; however if you like fresh ingredients and cooked well this is the place! 

Service was five star; every server we interacted with was great.  Would love to have his restaurant in my city!
