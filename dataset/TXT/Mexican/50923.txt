9-GNhPL4PBL2FOJc28KPMA Holy (insert all the cuss words here). This place is incredible.  Tiny little joint off Plaza, serving us amazing $8 specials of three tamales with rice and beans.  You can get a selection if you want. Also enjoyed two tacos $3 ea and two glass bottle cokes ($2.50), which were the best tacos - beating out my personal fav La Unica. And glass bottle coke is delish, so basically everything about this $20 meal for two is perfect. Try all the sauces and I promise you will roll out full and happy.
