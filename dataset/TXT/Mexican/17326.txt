Having just spent 3 days in Sedona eating excellent food, this place topped them all.  And the service is wonderful as well.  Between the four of us, I and the other husband had the daily special, pork ribs in green sauce with rice and beans for $5.95.  This included two tortillas.  Ridiculous outrageous flavor with two super tender pork ribs. If my wife wasn't with me watching my diet, I would have ordered another order.  The other guy also said it was the best meal of the vacation.  Our meal for 4 people including 3 ice teas came to $24.  The Happiness Value for us was at least $10 per person so I gave the waitress $40.  The need to move and expand.  This is one of the most wonderful diners ever.  Honest!
