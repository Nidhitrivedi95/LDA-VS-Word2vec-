B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA On a trip to Las Vegas with my family, we stopped here for lunch. I was very excited since I really love sushi! It definitely lived up to my expectations. They have vegetarian options, a build your own burrito option, and even sushi bowls! I personally chose to have a sushi burrito with soy paper, sushi rice, shrimp tempura, and eel sauce. It's amazing! Sushi burritos are a blessing to this universe in my opinion.
