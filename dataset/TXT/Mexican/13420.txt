0jAexNHRHhkQv4zNYqenBA This place is pathetic!  I love Old Town and had heard some interesting things about this place.  I decided to try it for a quick drink on Cinco de Mayo before dinner.  It is in a great location, but that is the only positive. 

The service is some of the worst that I have ever seen in Scottsdale.  The bartenders, management, and bouncers were all rude, slow, and extremely pretentious.  

The place is very dirty (wet floors, dirty table tops).  I felt like I was at a fraternity house.

Also, the bartender changed the tip amount on my card.  Such a shady practice and I will certainly be disputing it.

You could not pay me to come back here.
