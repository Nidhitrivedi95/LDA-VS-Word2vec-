VH2BjFjc9usDquDgoHhptA Barrio is truly one of the best Happy Hours in town! With $3 margaritas and $1 off tacos, you can eat and drink like royalty on a low budget.

They also are an extremely inventive group of people, introducing new and exciting dips, drinks and tacos each month. 

At the Tremont location, one particular bartender makes the world's best margaritas with unique flavor profiles that even his coworkers don't know his recipes. I wish I could tell you the flavor but I can describe it as sweet with a bit of sour and potentially melony, but I could be way off.
