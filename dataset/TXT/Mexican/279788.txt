After beginning my order the guy making it was super nice and very helpful, where it went downhill was when the lead, a girl of mixed decent, asked me what the customers name was. I told her, and she gave the other workers a look and then told me she had already made it in an exasperated tone. I said I sorry but the app had told me to order and not pick up, I then showed them all the screen. She then walked away and another employee told me I could pick it up at the other counter. As I was paying for the order, she loudly says to the people behind me "do you want these burritos? I'll give them to you for free." They way she spoke made me feel as though everything was a bother to her, and I don't appreciate the tone. If you don't like working there, find somewhere else to work.
