DW Bistro has been a staple on the Southwest side of town for years now. I recently stopped by their new location in the Gramercy and decided to write a long overdue review.

DW is probably most famous for their Sunday Brunch, but they are an all-around great option regardless of time of day. They are one of the only Jamaican Fusion restaurants I know of in Vegas, and they do a really amazing job of bringing through Jamaican flavors in many of their dishes. They're not about traditional Jamaican eats...even their Jerk Chicken is not a traditional style Jerk Chicken, but what they are about is good portions of slightly elevated, super tasty food.

My most recent visit was for Sunday Brunch. My love and I shared the Salmon Benedict and a Special Jerk Chicken on Corn Bread Benedict. Both items were really good. I also tried a little of their Chicken N Waffles...this was a solid item, but not my favorite version. I'm a fan of the Jamaican Chicken Curry Bowl, Couscous Salad, Daily Street Tacos, and Fish Escovitch. The owners are great and I feel good about supporting a local spot when I eat here. My love raves about the service of Alfonso, and I finally had the opportunity to experience the warmth of his huge smile and his incredible service on my last visit.
