fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg First time eating there and I had a fantastic time! 
First,  great atmosphere,  vibe and decor. 
Liz was our server and Rose was our busser. Couldn't have had better service!! Very attentive and helpful.  Drinks were never empty and was checked on just the right amount of time. I'm a Vegas local and have been the restaurant business for over 20yrs. Not a big fan of going to the strip cause service is usually poor, but not here! Food was fantastic and portions were very generous!
Thank you for putting my faith back in some casino restaurants. 
I'll will be back and have been passing in the word!!
Thank you again to Liz, Rose and kitchen staff!!
