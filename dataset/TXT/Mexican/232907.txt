spvjNOYeR7sFX6yTgP21og Had the Camarones Al Diablo (sauteed shrimp) and it was pretty good! The shrimp were large, tasty and you get quite a few. The side rice and beans were also quite good. 

The staff, however, kept getting my friend's drink order wrong, like at least twice but finally got it right. 

Deep fried ice cream was great, both the soy and vanilla.

Planning on going back, esp because we have another online voucher! :)
