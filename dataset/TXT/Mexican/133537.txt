iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg I'm not sure what all the hype is all about. We got the baja, gobernador, and black pepper marlin. 

The baja while crispy didn't offer much flavour. It tasted pretty bland. 

The black pepper marlin was also pretty disappointing in that we can't get much flavour out of it. 

The Gobernador has flavour but the flavour of the tuna is masked by so many other ingredients in this dish that it didn't feel special at all.
