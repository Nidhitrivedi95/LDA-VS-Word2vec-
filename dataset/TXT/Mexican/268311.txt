WlBvw6R1Qe2yIaZp-2ilZA The chips and bean dip were good, although the red and green "salsas" were bad.  They were not salsa.  The red salsa tasted kind of like barbecue sauce and bacon.  The tomato soup was very good.  Our entrees were disappointing.  My husband had the green Chile relleno and said that it was the only time he had ever ordered that dish somewhere and did not enjoy it.  I had the cheese enchiladas and was also very disappointing.  The enchiladas were smothered in the so-called red salsa, and they were stuffed with an unusual cheese not typically used in Mexican dishes.  The accompanying beans and rice were odd.  The rice was dyed green and the refried beans were actually pureed black beans.  They tasted OK, but it all looked unappetizing.  The service from the staff was good, as was the atmosphere, but the food just wasn't very good.
