OTcBXjDkViDPds4Lxy8KIQ I'm a born and raised New Mexican living in SoCal and every time im in Vegas I need to get my chile fix. Carlitos has always been THE (only) spot west of Gallup to get good NM cuisine. I LOVED this place at the old location, and today tried the new one. I desperately want to give this place 4 stars (back in the day it was 4 or 5 stars easily), but it seems they changed the menu and portion sizes of some items. Now they come in "half" or "full" portions, the half portion being the size of a regular one at the old location. So I ordered a bean stuffed sopapilla to go, not knowing about the changes, I was charged almost $13 for the sopapilla as the woman taking the order never mentioned there was an option for half of full. I only wanted the half (normal sized) portion. That's fine, I guess. So I got a plate with two stuffed sopas. It was pretty good- But it seems as though the food is a lot less authentic, along with the new decor. The green chile looked almost like a pale green salsa, no meaty bits of green in there at all, and it lacked heat. The red chile was ok, but not the same. It seems like they stopped using Bueno chile in their food and went for something cheaper. Also, they started adding cilantro to the onions they garnish the plates with. I asked for extra onions on mine and also got a ton of cilantro. That's Mexican, not New Mexican, and it made my food taste, well, not like the home cooking I'm used to from this place. Despite everything, my biggest gripe was the lack of ambience. The old location was full of paintings , Lobos gear, and other distinctly New Mexican decor. Now it looks pretty, well...bland. I miss the old Carlitos. I feel bad writing this because I love supporting great local places, especially my home team, but if you are looking for the same Carlitos, be forewarned.
