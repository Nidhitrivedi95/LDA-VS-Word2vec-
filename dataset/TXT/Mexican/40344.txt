6qKjl6xJQzLb9ka-QbTudA From out of town and searched for a high star Mexican restaurant for lunch.  In a storefront and had photos of some of the meals on the window, so we weren't sure, and almost passed it up.  Glad we went in!  Food was delicious and presented nicely.  Salsa verde and red salsa were both outstanding.  Would definitely go back again!
