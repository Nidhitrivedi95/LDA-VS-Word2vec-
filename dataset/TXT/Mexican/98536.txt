EP1do6l8hLyIGEru0gN3EQ I am a local here in OC and have been to Johnny Mangos a few times.  Up until today most of my experiences have been pretty pleasant. (minus one time I went for brunch and had the most pathetic home fries I have ever seen. And I have ate a lot of home fries in my life. The most shocking part of it, my server said this was the standard home fry they serve.) Anyways, my girlfriend and I arrived on a Saturday night around 4:30 before the dinner rush. There was still a good amount of open tables.  So we walk in and immediately we saw some friends at the bar, after about 5 minutes of talking we sat down at a table. We were never greeted by a server after about another 5-7 mins I got up and asked for a server. So the guy I asked, who ended up being our server said okay not apologizing once. After he got to my table he didn't say hi or anything he immediately said to my girlfriend. Can I get you a drink? in a snotty tone. After we got drinks we ordered our food. Took about 30 mins to finally arrive (not a busy dining room). The steak burrito I got with the big plate was just OK. Steak tasted good but there was very little amount. The tortilla was stone cold and the sides were bland. I would of sent it back but no one ever stopped over and checked on our food. My girlfriend got the veggie Pad Thai which was pretty good. 

I am just disappointed with the service most of all. The food was okay nothing memorable. Not going to go out of my way to eat there again.
