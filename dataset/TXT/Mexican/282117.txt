XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Good: YES  

Great: NO

Decor: interesting, colorful, a little in your face and a little tiresome over the course of a meal.

Service: friendly, happy, a little too much, over-the-top, bordering on annoying.

Food: MOST IMPORTANT !!!

White Tiger Shrimp Tamale appetizer: original,  well-executed, quality ingredients, however surprisingly salty - weird as I like salt.

Squash Blossoms with Mango Chile Sauce: good texture, crispy, visually appealing, however the blossom itself was a little bland and the sauce a little cloyingly sweet.

Pork Tenderloin in Ancho Chile Bourbon Sauce: with two complimentary sauces and a sweet corn tamale on the side: LIKE BUTTER !!! The tenderloin was buttery, moist and decadent. Again the sauce was a little too sweet but offset by the red pepper sauce droplets and the cilantro oil. The tamale was tiny and delicious.

Dessert: Banana Creme Pie on steroids - gorgeous banana creme mousse piped between two hazelnut toffee thin cookies, which covered beautifully thinly sliced bananas. Gorgeous, artistic and tasty.

Also! wonderful margaritas - excellent balance of sweet, salty, acidic and beauty in presentation.

Would I try this again? Hard call as there are so, so many choices in Viva Las Vegas.
