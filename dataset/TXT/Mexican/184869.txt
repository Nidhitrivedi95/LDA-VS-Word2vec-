NSgSagwajv26iS8zUKs2EQ Stopped in for a quick dinner.  Had the chicken & shrimp fajita.  Portion was smaller than the average Mexican restaurant but was one of the best fajitas I ever had.  My companion had the ahi tuna tacos and loved them.  Sangria not the greatest I ever had, but ambiance was nice, excellent spot to watch all sports/games, service by Ruby was great!
