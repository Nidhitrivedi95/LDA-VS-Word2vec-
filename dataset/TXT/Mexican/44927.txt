7m1Oa1VYV98UUuo_6i0EZg Hands down the best f*****g burger I've ever had in my entire life!!! These fellas are real chill and make a damn fine burger for sure. Do yourself a favor and make a trip to this joint as it's well worth the trip!! Be sure and try the Brulee Burger and wash it down with a Lucky Charms Milkshake!!!
