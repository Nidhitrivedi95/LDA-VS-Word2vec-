frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A We went based on Yelp reviews and are very happy for it.  The restaurant has an authentic feel to it and some interesting wall art.  Not a single sombrero in sight.  We both had the tacos,  which are amazing. I recommend you get 2, unless you are really hungry.  The guacamole we had was also very good.  All the staff were friendly and helpful.  We recommend this place.
