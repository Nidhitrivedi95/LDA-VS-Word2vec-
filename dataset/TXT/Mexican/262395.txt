vz8HFGsITt6aj-nyXkAEFg We have been going to El Encanto for years. The drive out to Cave Creek is an easy escape from the city to find excellent food in a wonderful setting. At El Encanto it's not hard to imagine you are a thousand miles away. My wife and I celebrated our 30th anniversary there recently and the staff went out of their way to accommodate our special requests. Food was great as usual and staff were gracious and professional in every aspect. Special thanks to Ryan, Eric and Robin for all they did to make a special evening come together seamlessly.
