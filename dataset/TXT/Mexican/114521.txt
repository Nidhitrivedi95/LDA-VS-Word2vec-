This is definitely one of the more unique restaurants down in the area.  We got 12 or so tacos as a team -- personally, I got the braised short rib and the pork belly.  They were both delicious, but all of them looked really good.  This was the first lunch spot I went to with my work squad over the summer, and we probably proposed it at least once a week from then on for lunch -- ultimately, there were just so many other places we wanted to try!

I'd go again if I were near East Blvd more often.
