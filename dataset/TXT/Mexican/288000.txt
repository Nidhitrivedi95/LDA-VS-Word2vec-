Yevhl8bTwdJuu_LWKv-4Fw I personally loved the place!  When looking for a place to eat near where I was staying, the words "Latin" and "Rum" caught my eye and every other place I looked at on yelp, those words kept on flitting back into my mind.

Those words did not disappoint me...

*I had the mango, cilantro mojito because I'm in love with mojitos - didn't disappoint.
*Had to try the guacamole because I'm an voracious avocado fiend -- didn't disappoint (which, they have a few special guacs as well, but I just got the original).
*Then I went for the special, the rainbow trout on corn fritters with sauteed shrimp and corns and veggies on top.  Wasn't disappointed ut I wasn't in heave.  But, to be fair, I think it was because I had such a hard time deciding from the menu and there was a sandwich and a wrap that I was looking at as well - it had turkey and bacon and AVOCADO on it.... I really was yearning for that, but wasn't really wanting the "bread" factor so I wound up with the trout special.  I think that sandwich/wrap choice was still in my head so my taste buds were not willing to be completely happy.  Don't get me wrong, the trout was delicious, but when bacon and avocado is stuck in your head.... I'll have to try it next time.

I will say that the menu is absolutely overwhelming as, if you tend to like Latin foods, everything looks absolutely delicious and its sheer torment.  SO - bring a group and make sure to try a bunch of stuff and PLEASE post the things that were absolutely delicious so that you can pay it forward and help other people decide from this amazing menu.

Oh - one more comment... Great service and really cute and classy atmosphere!  Loved it!
