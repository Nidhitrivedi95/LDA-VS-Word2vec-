nveeiYhDhj0WJu1JUmx9fw Today wife & I had a late lunch.  We started with guacamole, chips and salsa.  I had beef enchiladas topped with green sauce, wife had SHRIMP COCKTAIL, Mexican-style cocktail made with tomato juice, vegetable juice, fresh pico de gallo and avocado.  The only thing to say is:  Wow! Great food.  This is our favorite Mexican restaurant!  Everything is fresh and made from scratch, beans and rice are homemade and delicious, flavors are tasty, their salsa has a bit of a kick, and the chips and guacamole are wonderful.  All the servers use a phone app to take orders and a bonus is the attentive service we had from friendly employees.  We will return.....
