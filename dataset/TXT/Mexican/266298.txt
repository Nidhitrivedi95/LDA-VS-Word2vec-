WFB1fn8rWNukmmIfTg6AMw I keep wondering to myself why I haven't tried this place out sooner. It's a family owned business and everyone is so friendly here. 

I've visited twice prior to writing this review. The first time was for take out, I went with the chicken, mushroom, and pork tacos. The food didn't take long to prepare and I was in and out within 10mins. I was also given complimentary chips and with salsa as well. 

Ay Caramba Eh is a two minute drive to my house and as soon as I got home I dug in immediately. Everything was perfectly moist, had the right amount of seasoning and the toppings complimented the meat perfectly. The only downside was that the taco broke apart very easily. Most likely due to the take out container trapping heat and making the tacos soggy. 

The second time I visited was for dine in. My friends and I got tacos and nachos to share. This time I tried the fish and beef. While my friends really enjoyed the fish taco, I preferred the beef. It was moist, perfectly seasoned and this time the taco didn't break apart. The nachos had generous amounts of topping on them, I just wish there were more cheese lol. 

Overall I'd recommend this place but more for dining in than take out.
