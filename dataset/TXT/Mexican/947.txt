Food: excellent, no nonsense presentation carnitas, fish and  pork tacos were delicious, not over-marinated or so stuffed w extra stuff that you wondered if there was any meat.  Very Tasty. Very Filling.  Kale salad also delicious...new favorite since Zinburger no longer offers a kale salad.  Get the Mexican corn appetizer.  It's messy but oh so delicious! CHips standard--warm and crispy, salsa excellent (flavorful, smoky. We went through three bowls!). 

Drinks: excellent.  Margaritas are yummy 

Service: above par especially for as BUSY as it was
Wait time: reasonable for a busy Friday night (just under 30 min)...hostess was amazing during the wait. Indoor and outdoor seating with roll up bay doors for ventilation when needed. 

Noise level: extreme. Difficult to hear general conversation, background music added to the noise level. (Not a restaurant for romantic whispering!) Great place for gathering of friends. Fun atmosphere, great food and drinks   

Joyride is excellent....indoors needs a noise dampening system but overall great atmosphere, excellent food and drinks and service.
