08R3xSHVEFtvn7oxLu54sQ New biz alert! Sweet, super friendly new spot on Beaubien, right next to Cafe Odessa, opened two nights ago. We went down to check it out last night and it was already bumping but they grabbed us the last table for 4 in this tiny spot. 

Drinks: Paloma and Margarita were delicious and strong, loved the rim on the Paloma. The water of the day was a hibiscus infusion and my friend who hadn't liked hibiscus in the past was totally won over by it. The daily waters are super flavourful and refreshing and less sugary than a pop or juice - a big glass at $2, awesome idea. 

Eats: I loved the jalapeno pepper app stuffed with bacon and sausage and deep fried. It was too spicy for some at the table, but super delicious for meeee, like what a jalapeno popper dreams of being when it grows up. I also loved the cactus salad, bright and fresh with salty Mexican cheese and tomatoes, super good. Our mains all were well received - I had the tortas of the day which were  piled with chicken, cheese and sour cream and a red sauce. 

The service is wonderful, so warm and funny and friendly and excited to share authentic Mexican food and culture. When they found out we were neighbours they brought us shots of tequila, a kindly gesture for sure, and effective in putting the goofy grins over the top. 

The room is already warm, tasteful, cool fun vibes, and I think it will continue to get better - I think the lighting could be a little less harsh and that would go a long way.

All in all, so happy to have these sweet folks in the hood and I can't wait to eat there all the time!
