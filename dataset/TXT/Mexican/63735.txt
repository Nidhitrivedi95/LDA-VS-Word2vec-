The way it works is Subway style, you walk up and order what you want through an assembly line.  My third visit here, but first under Soho, I went with the same and my personal favorite customized order which consists of the seaweed wrapper, sushi rice, and I chose tuna and salmon with cucumber, green onions, seaweed salad, and poke sauce.  When I order a custom roll this is what I get also but seaweed salad on the side.  They have specialized burritos you can choose from as well if you don't know what you want.  I do think it's cool how the rice dispencer works though, spreads it out evenly on the sushi wrap.    

If your taste buds can handle sushi then I definitely recommend coming and trying this place.  Be warned, the taro chips they have here is very good.  But I feel as though the passion for sushi has been dumbed down here.
