HtctU6CwYrKN3r2SL259EA I went here a few months ago on a night when it was not very busy and I was rather disappointed with the service. I had to ask for my second drink 3 times before she finally brought it over and made me feel like a nuisance for asking. The food wasn't anything incredible but the guac was the best of the items we had.
