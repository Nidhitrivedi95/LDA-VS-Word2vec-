-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg Our first visit. Great place.  I had the tacos and they were excellent.  Love the fresh made and thick corn tortillas. The fillings were awesome as well.  I had chicken, carnitas and pork adobada... all flavored very well with creative extras like radishes and cilantro and Mexican slaw. My wife had the chicken burrito bowl. Huge serving of scrumptious and creative flavors. The squash and chicken were perfectly cooked. Service was top notch, as we had four different people stop by to help, bring food, refills, etc.

We will definitely return.
