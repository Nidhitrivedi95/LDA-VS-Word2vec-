2g4ZTD3ePNSbDAvh6qAOKQ BEST TORTAS IN AZ 
Growing up in north Phoenix I saw this place grow from a hole in the wall to buying the two businesses next door to expand this location. Not to mention Adam from the Travel channel's Man Vs. Food has been there as well. Honestly take it from a Mexican who eats a lot of tortas all over Arizona and even some of the other menu items are great! Love to show my friends this place they always end up going back cause they can't get enough!
