2RQuRcchOgTvFVrSARMHMQ Brand new to the Mill Ave area where I live. I went in on the soft opening day with my friend and was very happy with what I found! The building is super cool with a nice bar and small patio seating area. We tried 4 different tacos and they were all very very good. They have a condiment bar to dress them as you like...nice touch!
I had the jalapeño margarita and it was nicely spicy and excellent. My friend tried the  basil marg and we both actually ordered another of each so that tells you how good they are. The drinks are hand made and very authentic!!

Overall a great addition to the neighborhood! I'll be back often!
