xlXwxfiUD4bgJFKUYwkzOg Hey the food is pretty tasty and I will go there again. It serves a modern spin on traditional mexican food. Really fresh tasting ingredients but sometimes the "spin" was a bit baffling in a funny way. For example I ordered a tostada salad and although it was delicious and fresh it was not served in a tostado lol.  The "street tacos" do not perfectly reflect real street tacos 
 as the name would have you believe rather they are inspired by them. The meat had more of a slow cooker thing going on and had some flavors I did not recognize from usual street taco but I enjoyed them.  This modern and fresh spin probably serves the business very well considering it's location at the Green Valley Casino. Pretty cool vibe and friendly servers.
