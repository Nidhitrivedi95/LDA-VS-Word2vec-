HaOvuZUzCLbObQfT8H44fw If you have a craving for authentic mexican food, this is your spot. I bought a house close by so I could visit often. Kidding. I didn't know about Lazaro's when I bought my house, but I do visit often, so it worked out for the best. The food is great, the people are great, the prices are great. I'm here once a week on average.
The only problem that I've run into is the weekend crowd, expect a bit of a wait, but it's well worth it.
