frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A I don't give 5 stars. But LS deserves it-- amazing, life changing food. Good atmosphere and nice staff. But the food is phenomenal. They have 30+ different kinds of tacos alone-- even vegan ones! But the clincher is they do protein style tacos. So low carb people delight!!! They wrap their tacos in crispy Oaxaca cheese and omg it's amazing. I'm not on a low carb diet and I still order it. Yum! I'm Hispanic so horchata is staple. But their horchata is out of this world. I stop by just to order one and leave. Try it. You will not be disappointed.
