nveeiYhDhj0WJu1JUmx9fw My husband and I came here on a Saturday night a little before 6 and had no problem being seated.

We had the fajitas (I had chicken, he had combo) and they were delicious! The combo fajitas were fantastic! Plenty of meat and peppers.

Chips and salsa were great, but I would definitely skip the queso in the future. 

We read reviews saying the service was terrible, but our service was fantastic! We'd go back.
