DuQtouEXOfo5K4ukON3qwQ My husband and I have been here several several times since the first visit, we have introduce friends also.  LOVE the guac.  We always sit in the bar witch is always comfortable and excellent service.  Still love the fajitas and have found the blue enchilada with egg is a favorite also.  Two nights ago we were there and my husband finally tried the enchilada with egg and his comments was "your right, the egg enhances it.  This is really good!"  Do not go on a Fri or Sat night, can not get into the bar.
I would like to see them fix up the patio for outdoor dinning.  But even if they don't we will still continue to go there.
