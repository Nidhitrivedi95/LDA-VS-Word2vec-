We knew it was a hipster joint by decor. but, was starving and was in the mood for something new to us. I did like a few things about the inside right when I came in and I also hated alot. looked like an employee drew something on the chalk board,  well whoever that was probably should of painted their tacky walls too. . It's not original. They could make the inside much better with a spot like that. Heard the place before it was real laid out. Hmm..wish that was still around.  And now food,  service was actually pretty good the server was honest as I believe to his actual opinion. But he probably likes bland food.  Looks like the menu chef tried too hard to be different like over-did it on being 'creative' could of really lightened up on the 'what's trendy' aspect. We shared a Tuscan guacamole it's nasty.  Too much toppings that didn't mix well and guacamole itself looked like it came from a package even thought it was probably made right in back. Chips greasy. Tacos not good.  Not going back and don't recommend.  I know good food and this place is a wanna be.
