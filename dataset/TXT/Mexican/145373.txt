jhj-r7aH3AlJyVmGtcHi-Q After working a shift in the same plaza, I thought I'd check this place out for a quick bite before heading home. I went in and ordered a beef burrito to go and what I received, I found to be particularly amusing.

This place cooks like someone who had heard about Mexican food. Like someone was explaining a burrito to them and in the middle they said 'Ok, ok, I totally get it. Turn on the open sign'. The burrito I received was about 90% tortilla, with a small smattering of meat and veggies collected at the base.

I gave this place two stars instead of one because technically I did order a burrito and they gave it their best shot.
