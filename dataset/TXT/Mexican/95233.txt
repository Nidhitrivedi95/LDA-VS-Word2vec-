eDK7ns2bB8pmQCoZMy3Idg I was in Las Vegas for the weekend and noticed this place on Yelp due to its high star rating. The pupusas were amazing and the banana empanadas were also delicious. The food was hot and freshly prepared to order. The service was prompt and the staff was very friendly and attentive. Don't be fooled by the simplistic exterior of the restaurant. This place is definitely a must try for Salvadorian food and they also have a section on the menu for Mexican food as well. I didn't have room for desert but I would imagine anything they prepare with bananas would be worth trying so consider a fried banana desert if you eat here.
