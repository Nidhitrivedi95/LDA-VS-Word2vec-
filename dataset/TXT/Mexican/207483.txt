q7MorRPzU_J-iekeDKUKgw i love this place. i'd give more details but my memories are a bit fuzzy. oops. did i mention that i loved this place and had a really good time here? :)

it's small, can get crowded at times, the tables get full fast, they have a  small back patio. the music is good, the drinks are excellent. if you can score a table or a set at the bar, you're in for a night.
