scEnuZvnBMNPxQ8m4KLVHw Giant yawn. This restaurant is what white people eat when they think they want Mexican food. Boring, bland, and most of all, EXPENSIVE. My margarita cost me 13$, only 2$ less than my burrito, which at 15$, is officially the most expensive burrito I've ever had. This wouldn't be so bad if it had actually tasted like anything, but nope. The decor is dark, and sleek and unwelcoming. The bar on the first floor seemed more inviting than the restaurant itself. The salsa was smooth and tasted vaguely of...something, maybe tomatoes? Really disappointing. My burrito was spicy, thank god, because if it hadn't been, it would have tasted like a 15$ plate of air. The rice was OK, but there really could have been more veggies. The service was slow, and somewhat pushy. 

No, just no.
