rXUZNVlpWMV5ORDDSguOEQ I could simply kick myself for just finding out about this place!  I am in love with the taco's here...L-O-V-E.....love!  They're just so darn good the authentic corn tortilla taco's as well as the homemade hard shell taco's, plus the salsa.....omg!  Please know that if it were not bathing suit season you would see oh so much more of me but never fear, I'll be a regular come October because you are truly as your name suggest.....'the one and only'!
