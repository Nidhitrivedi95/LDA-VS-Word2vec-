The place was clean and the service was good. My issue was it was quite warm inside. The AC may have been having issues as I heard a customer ask about it. The temp inside was definitely cooler than the heat outside but that doesn't say much since it was like 115F!! Sweet Jesus! 

So sure, its good but not above average. Will I go here again? Um.. Will see. This isn't my hood so more than likely not. Will I go to any Baja Fresh again? Yes, sure.
