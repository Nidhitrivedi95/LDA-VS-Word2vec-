qCSWNJ2ClIaO5XTfzsiYFA Worst experience ever dining there tonight with my husband and daughter.  We live 5 minutes from this restaurant and will never go there again.  They have messed up our order on several occasions and same issue tonight.  I ordered a grilled chicken salad and the waitress said you want a taco salad and I said no just the grilled chicken salad and even pointed to it on the menu and she looked down at the menu with me.  Of course when it came out it was a taco salad.  When we called her over to point out the mistake she argued with me about what I ordered and even went so far as to tell me she would fix me something else but that was what I had ordered.  My husband even spoke up and said no that is not what she ordered.  I finally just told her to take it back.  My husband asked for the check and when she came back she continued to insist she didn't make a mistake and be argumentative with me.  She said well I didn't charge you for it and my husband and I both said well we had no intention of paying for it since we sent it back and did not order anything else.  We asked to speak to the manager and she said there was no manger.  Completely disappointed in the poor customer service and we won't return there again.  Their food is just ok anyway it is just convenient for us and did go there routinely.
