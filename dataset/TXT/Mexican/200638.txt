pf3kPNPGA15kggbgL92UXg I don't often get good mexican food anymore now that I live in Canada - so every time I'm in Vegas, I always head for Macayo's.

On my first visit last week I ordered my all-time favourite, a Chili Relleno. It wasn't as tasty as the one I had last year, and now rice and beans are an extra cost. I don't know what was different, other than it just wasn't as good as usual. the Relleno sauce seemed different, and I couldn't taste the chili as much as I should.

On my second visit during the same trip, I ordered the shredded beef chimichanga. It was heaven! The chimi was huge, the beef was very flavourful, beans were perfect, it was heaven!

Next trip to Vegas will mean another couple trips to Macayo's for sure!
