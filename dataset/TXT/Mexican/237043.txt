SW6ZQk22G1_CV81_gfnvNQ La Carnita was a place that I recommended to all of my friends. Since the summer it had been serving, finally!, some good simple tacos in a comfortable easy going space.
We were there this weekend and unfortunately it, cynically, has dropped to the standards of its clientele.  It's crowded all the time so why bother making the effort?
The margueritas were tasteless, the fish taco was overdone and overbattered. The chorizo was greasy.  The corn was tough and unappealing.  Very disappointing. 
It's a real shame. La Esquina in NYC and its take out Corner has been in business for 7 years and still puts out a great taco and an excellent marguerita. There are all kinds of people there, lots who don't care but I feel that they get that there are enough that do and that its important to keep things on the up and up. 
So sadly I would say the promise of a great taco joint in TO is still unfulfilled. 
Please someone pick up the slack.
