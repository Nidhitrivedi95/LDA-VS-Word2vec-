2aiaryk7kgUBhXhVu-9vHg We visited midweek for my boyfriend's brother's birthday. We'd booked the table for four people, and my other half and I arrived there promptly. After waiting for a while (with a bottle of wine, of course) his two brothers showed up; with one of their friends in tow. The waiter didn't even blink , he just brought another chair over and squeezed us all in. This pleased me, as I know some restaurants can be a bit funny about this sort of thing.

I didn't get a chance to try the margheritas, although I did spend most of the night gazing longingly at them over my Merlot. For the main I had the lamb cooked with honey, which I thought was delicious. I was quite disappointed that I wasn't given more bread to scoop it up with, however.

I want to go back and try their quesadillas.
