gGt00WW8sNY2Sop7jYa7Tw ***GET OVER THE PARKING!!*** get an Uber, park a few blocks away and walk or whatever lets you stop complaining about it. Seriously, if you want to eat GREAT food, check it out. It was recommended to us by a friend and we are so glad we came. BEST margaritas, short rib and pollo rojo tacos, AMAZING salsas and great staff. Would absolutely come back again. If you're worried about it being too packed, come on a Monday night. Great vibe, great food. Doesn't get any better than that!
