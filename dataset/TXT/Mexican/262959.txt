vzQkHCSFtYs3R0qRei2rjQ Got a golden margarita, it was ok. Service not the best, but whatever. Guacamole was fine, as were chips and salsa. 

I asked the server what the best thing was on the menu. Although I am not a native Spanish speaker, I am a Spanish teacher and have lived and traveled abroad extensively throughout central and South America. I trusted that he, a native spanish speaker, would recommend to me the most authentic meal at the restaurant. 

To my surprise, he said that the chimichanga and the quesadillas were the best thing on the menu. That says a lot...if a quesadilla (not mexican food) is the BEST thing at a mexican restaurant...chances are the food isn't very good...

I should've ordered that quesadilla. I ended up ordering chicken with mole. Mole had no flavor, no spice (not like the rich, spicy and cinnamony flavors that I am used to). I probably had four bites of the chicken and was finished. My friend ordered flautas. They are fried, so there is nothing you can really mess up. She said they were okay. 

Oh well!
