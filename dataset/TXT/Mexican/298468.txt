zJGtD3y-pAIGNId4codEEg Came in for lunch, have veggie taco with Rice and beans on the side, no very impressed with the veggie tacos,  more like an Asian stir fry, not Mexican cusine, at least goes my taste, I was not impressed with the rice heavy oil taste, buried the flavor of the rice. 
My recommendation do not come in for vegetarian tacos. If you are omnivorous the. Carne asada tacos are fantastic.so this time for lunch with mom very disappointed on the vegetarian side for tacos.
