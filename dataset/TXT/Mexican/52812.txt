9kk7eaffUzXwh-KLmKLxzw Well, this is my 2nd visit to San Carlos Bay, I was fortunate to get a parking as the  parking space seemed little small, they have remodeled the restaurant since the first time I came back in 2013, I somehow liked the older look. So, coming to the food, being from costal region in India I always loved Seafood and I was finding it so difficult to get a good seafood place in Phoenix, however this place didn't disappoint me, the fish was so fresh and delicious. They have the right amount of spice in all their dishes. Overall I would rate this place as one of the best seafood places you can try in Phoenix.
