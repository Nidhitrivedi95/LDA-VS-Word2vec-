uBGPTzye3wrxZPf54AXuFg I wanted to do some modeling but I ended up modernling instead, which basically means being naked on a webcam for some old dude. Welcome to 2017.

But back to the food.

I'm not surprised the reviews are low, but I also am because usually people are quite easily fooled in the US when it comes to Mexican food. This is not Mexican food by any stretch of the imagination - it's overpriced Tex-Mex, but it's not bad to be honest. It's a little too expensive for me to give it 4 stars, but I certainly don't hate it, and it's decent at the very least.

My salad was okay, not bad, and at least it was somewhat cheap. There are 1,300 places I'd rather eat in Cleveland though. So there's nuevo I'll be coming back (get it - no way).
