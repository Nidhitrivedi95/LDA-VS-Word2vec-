rskBlUDRTceD5skTS0-tdg Stopped in for lunch on a Monday afternoon at Noon.  Took 20 minutes for them to make my nachos. One guy waiting for his food crumpled his receipt and threw it behind the counter before storming out without his food order.  Some guests coming into order left because nobody took their order.  Never again.
