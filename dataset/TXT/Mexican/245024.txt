tNky09c0HBYiHxizht0gCQ Really guys?? 1.07 for extra cheese?? and you don't even tell me before charging me..so, I just paid 9.00 for a burrito??

I didn't notice the charge till I got home and was getting ready to dig in...I've been coming here 2-3 times a week for nearly 3 months and this seems a bit cheap and unnecessary..at least warn me youre going to tack on the extra charge..

My Zabas kick is oficially over.
I won't be back.
