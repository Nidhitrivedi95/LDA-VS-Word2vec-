R-sEoZXf37pGzLnid7s6wA What a great place! The staff was super attentive and the menu is amazing. I haven't had a really good taco in a long time and they didn't fail to impress me. Their lengua tacos are the best I have had in Arizona and their salsas are really good. Can't wait to try more off their menu. Everything looks so good!!
