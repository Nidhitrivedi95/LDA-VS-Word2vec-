mz1zD5_eqyCQNuzAqB_iKg I came to this little place today on my way to the DMV, I was short on time and I heard great things about it. Don't ever come here if you are in a rush. I nearly had a heart attack watching them make my meal, I asked them to put it in a to go box because it was taking so long.  I figured I would just eat it on the way to the DMV. I don't remember what I had ordered but it was Vegan. Blah Blah Blah. Is this the best Vegan food in Las Vegas? YES IT IS. Why? Because in Mexico people don't eat what we think of Mexican food here. People in Mexico actually eat what we call vegan all the time and no one is watching over their shoulders keeping tabs on when they ate meat or dairy. Mexican food in Mexico just happens to be vegan a lot of the times. And this little place in Las Vegas does just that. Real authentic Mexican food that just happens to be Vegan (with the exception of the Vegan sour cream but you can do without just fine.) So that's my review. If you went there and didn't like it then you just didn't get it. The way you probably didn't get that Jackson Pollock at the Modern. Your loss.
