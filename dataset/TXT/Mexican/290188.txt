Service was excellent, the wine list was very good and had several excellent and rare half bottles. My Kobe burger was competent, not memorable. The Old Bay Seasoned fries tasted great but lacked some crispness. Highlight of lunch was seeing Steve Wynn at an adjacent table. Slight recommendation. CTS (Consider the source).
