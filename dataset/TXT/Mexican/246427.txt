Tv1CcqD67_Bz9YJadLgMuw This is by far, the worst burrito I have ever had. Burritos are my favourite food and I try one everywhere I can. 

This chicken is so plain it is almost like they didn't try to put seasoning on it (let alone mexican seasoning). The ingredients were so scarce and they don't press the burrito. It is similarly priced to burrito boys, burrito bandidos, and chipotle, so don't even bother trying this one! You will not be missing anything!
