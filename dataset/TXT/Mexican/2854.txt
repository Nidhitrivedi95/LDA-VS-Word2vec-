-kTHAUKuzh7cFZjVAW55Ug I love Chipotle and have probably gone to most locations within driving distance of my house. This Chipotle happens to be my hometown 2 min away location and I'm so happy to have one close w well prepared food & friendly service,  BUT it is also the absolute slowest, S L O W, slowest location I've ever been to. When it first opened, I chalked it up to newness, but they are as disorganized as the day they opened. Tonight for example there was a line out the door around 7pm and at least 5 or 6 people working but only one women on the line.  There appears to be no order behind the counter, people jumping on and off register. Doesn't everyone get assigned a location? Man your post, Harness the power of the assembly line people and get organized! I've seen other locations where everyone seems to know what they are assigned to, communicate and even appear at ease instead of running around like headless chickens.
