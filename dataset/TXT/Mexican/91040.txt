DYnFGGYU3SkrKT_G4djpYQ We were in downtown Scottsdale to see one of the last shows at the Camelview 5, so sad that it's closing, and decided we wanted to try somewhere new for lunch after the movie. Two choices came to mind: America's Taco Shop and Cornish Pasty. My partner and I went back and forth but settled on America's Taco Shop.

As we walked up to the entrance I had the ah hah moment that I'd already tried there tacos at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport...and wasn't impressed. After all the back and forth and because this was their original location I decided to give it another try. In my opinion, don't bother.

The tacos were flavorless, beans and rice were cold. The chips and salsa were the highlight of the meal that cost $25. That's too expensive for street tacos.
