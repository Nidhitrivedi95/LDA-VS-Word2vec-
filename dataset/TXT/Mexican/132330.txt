ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA Food was alright I would go back just get something maybe it'll change my mind. It was my server that made my experience not great. I've been there before with my family and it great. Reason why I went back. This time I was disappointed. 

I have IndiCard which is a discounted app for people in Vegas who work in the industry. For this particular restaurant the deal was "50% of margaritas and $5 beer bottle or draft." 
After we finished eating we wanted drinks. We tell Sergio which drinks we want (Sergio my waiter) and he walked away before I could even tell him about my IndiCard. He comes back with my drinks, again walks away before I could even say "I have a question." He comes back and asks if we were done and I say yes and I finally asked him about my IndiCard. 

He says I was suppose to say I have IndiCard before I order drinks. I've used IndiCard before and I've never had a problem with showing it last before I pay. This time it was a problem. He said there was nothing he can do to add my discount that if I would of showed he would type in some key that would automatically add the discount. 
I'm assuming the manager or owner was there that night and I wanted to speak with him but I didn't wanna be a total ass crying about $7 worth of a discount really. But then again if he would of stopped walking away every time I tried speaking to him this situation would of never happened. 

Working in the industry I know you can void things out and do it all over again. I also know it's a hassle but if a customer is unhappy or has a way of saving money you help them. Even if it's a pain. Because if you don't you get Yelp reviews like this. Sorry Sergio.
