1ZJz840L496LAmQdeDv0WA I ordered al pastor and lengua tacos as well as some potato taquitos for my son. The lengua was very good and tender. The tortillas are fresh made, but somehow still very dry. The al pastor was terrible, not tender at all, slightly dry and no flavor or pineapple. All in all this review should probably be 2 stars, but that lengua was super good
