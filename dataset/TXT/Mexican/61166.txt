as_fyujgsdwtV56n31z-Sw I've been to Bomba twice and I have to say it's a pretty nice experience. If I had one complaint it would be the amount of liquid in the tacos. You can't eat them without a waterfall of something cascading down the opposite side. It can also make for soggy taco bottoms. Aside from that, the tacos are pretty good, not too bad on price and the drinks are tasty as well. I'll be back for sure.
