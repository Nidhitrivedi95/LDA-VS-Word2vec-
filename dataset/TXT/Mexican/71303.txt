C2BR0TjNacoNzItPLUHTAA How can you go wrong with Coconuts?  I love the Fish Tacos. They are the best I have found in town. I would consider myself a "Fish Taco Connoisseur" and visit as many fish taco wielding establishments as possible. 

At Coconuts the staff rocks....the restaurant is always clean and the food NEVER fails. This a go-to for me and I share it with all my buddies. 

A great call for sure.
