D3MfMrIoNV4_aXPj0bi1BQ I love Lopez.  Yes, it's pricier than your average Mexican restaurant.  But in my opinion it is totally worth it.  The servers are very friendly.  I had a goat cheese & portabella quesadilla and it was TO DIE.  They have a good selection of tequila.  Also, I highly recommend ordering a guacamole flight, they have one with bacon in it!
