x2nItJPCZxEobThRyDg6HQ What else can I say? Chipotle is my life.

Generous portions here with excellent customer service! Like seriously, this one worker went around during the busy lunch rush to make sure everyone was enjoying their meals - don't see that at other fast food establishments! 

Always quite a line during the lunch rush but service moves quickly. Only downside is debit is not accepted here, only cash/credit. Also ample parking lot at this plaza (with a lot of other food options as well if you're with a picky group).

Also if you've never tried the sofritas before, give it a try even if you're not vegetarian! You won't be able to tell it's tofu :)
