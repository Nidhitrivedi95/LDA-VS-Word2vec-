_XN-GwzZwAyIqLKJsl2htg Fancy fancy Asian Mexican fusion.  Personally, I'm a little wary when it comes to anything Asian fusion.  Mainly because I am Asian, and I get overly critical with the spices.  SumoMaya had turned that negativity to a really positive experience.

We started with the bacon guacamole appetizer.  You're thinking, bacon?  Really?  Seems like everything comes with bacon lately.  Trust me, you won't want to pass this bacon opportunity.  They use thick slices of crisped bacon, cut into large chunks.  it was more of a garnish for the housemate guac.  Yum!  Il liked how extra chunky the guac was, served with the bacon and two pieces of fresh cracklin'.  Never tried fried pork rinds until now, and realize I'm a fan.

I ordered the Korean Tacos and the spicy hamachi roll.  Gotta try both worlds.  Their sushi was average, and felt it lacked the spicy flavor it claimed in its name.  It would've been cool to see the roll made with some southwest spices rather than a traditional roll.    The Korean beef tacos were very good.  They really captured the Korean bbq flavors in the meat and i loved the pickled radish garnish on it.  The acidity cut through the garnish.
