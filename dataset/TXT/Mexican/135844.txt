INzLc1Y0JNQzIHjPH2Nbeg Tried this place with some co-workers for the first time this past week for lunch. I liked the overall layout of the place. They give you a buzzer once they take your order and it buzzes once your food is ready for you pick it up yourself from the kitchen window when it's hot off the grill. I had the shredded chicken nachos which were very good. The serving size was huge and the prices was even better compared to other places that I've dined at. If I had to say anything bad about my experience here I would say the parking is very limited because it's in an area with other eateries. It took about 10 minutes to find a a place to park. All in all it was a good meal and I look forward to eating there again.
