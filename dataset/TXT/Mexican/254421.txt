v8dfoVJkzoAzUgZeVmpRJA I usually take pictures to post with my review but it wasn't worth the battery life. Our server was Matthew. He made us feel like he was annoyed by us. The food was unimpressive. I had a taco salad. My boyfriend had the fajitas. Both were bland and sloppy. Afterwards we went to the bar for their "Happy Hour". The bartender was talking to either her boyfriend or husband or maybe he was a regular. Either way she was inattentive. I definitely won't be going back there. I don't feel like this was a bad day. I think it's more the norm.
