qd-nuT8GlS3hsjKmDDj72g I had a veggie burrito here early last week, and in hindsight it was just okay. This burrito joint, though in an awesome location (a short walk from the pier) relies upon style more than substance. Speakers blaring out Katy Perry's latest, unfortunately, and minions wearing cute beanies with ample piercings in questionable areas . Am I getting too old to understand why a 'monroe' seems like a good idea? 

Anyway, though I always love a solid helping of guacamole my burrito seemed a little, lacking, considering the fanfare and line up at BB. I would have liked a little more cheese and a little more spice. Strange, since I'm not very tolerant to it and I did order Medium Salsa. Maybe I should go with the flow and order a Bro Ho Burrito on my next visit?
