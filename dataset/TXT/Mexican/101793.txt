EvDUi_H6-JG3QfGWiInAlw Breakfast for lunch at the Wild Horse Pass casino diner sounded good, but ended up being a mix of good and bad.  The diner itself can be a little hard to find, being situated adjacent to the gaming next to the poker room.  The atmosphere is pretty cheery, with a huge pastry case greeting you as you walk in with nummy looking contents.  Our waitress was great - fast, solicitous and accurate.  It's the food that will keep me from coming back, though.  I opted for the breakfast skillet that ended up being some undercooked, greasy potatoes and veggies placed into a skillet-shaped pyrex dish.  Chef - where's the caramelization?!  Not to mention, where's the skillet?  My lunch partner got the monte cristo sandwich that turned out to be some lunchmeat between two pieces of french toast - literally.  I held back laughing at his sandwich since he did have to eat it and all, but it was pretty pitiful looking.  Those two items and one soda (one water) added up to $22.  Seemed expensive for what we got.  Can't recommend the place, but also haven't found a good alternative at that casino either.
