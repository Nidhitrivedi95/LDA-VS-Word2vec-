The salsa offered with the meal is also really good and has a solid kick afterthought. The rice is nice and moist (tip:add the salsa into the rice for extra flavor). The pasta is meh! Wouldnt recommend. Not so great is the customer service, the owners are always standing around talking which seems unprofessional. We also tried the carne asada which was simply okay. For grilled chicken though this is the place to go, infinitely trumps Pollo Loco.
