3SLDrXzPmKF0iCY8WriLsA Talk about quality! Not only are the employees friendly and the location ideal for a delicious lunch or dinner, but the quality of the food is fantastic! Every item is fresh, full of flavor, and the portions are perfect. I've had the carne asada, al pastor, and chicken tacos. The meat is so delicious that it doesn't NEED salsa, but you CAN'T skip the salsa (and chips)! The icing on the cake is the high tech Coca Cola machine; you can literally have any flavor of soda you could possibly imagine. You will not be disappointed in this restaurant!
