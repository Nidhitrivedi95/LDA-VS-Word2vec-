MesBAxNk_M7ISbBmVDiiWQ The margaritas are huge!  I ordered the strawberry jalapeño margarita it was delicious. Everything on the menu looked really good. I would have given this place 5 stars if they had more options for vegetations. My husband who is a vegetation could only order one thing with out meat. (Vegetable burrito) And we also had to wait 30 mins for our food that I thought was odd for a Mexican restaurant that wasn't very busy at 230 in the afternoon.
