fK1oj0dk9Bc6KsBk5mMDxg We checked out Playa Cabana Cantina on a frigidly cold night back in February.  I would say that reservations are absolutely necessary if you want a table at this busy new Junction eatery.  They are easily made online at least 2-3 days in advance.

We were seated at a high top for 4 and our waiter, resembling a young Eric Stoltz, encouraged us to get drinks and an order of chips/guacamole ($8) to start.  There was no debate when we decided to get a pitcher of the Cantina Crossroads margaritas ($29) to share.

Our food order - a chicken burrito entree ($14), fish tacos ($13) and short rib brisket tacos ($14).  Added a side of beans and rice to the tacos ($3 extra).  

The brisket tacos were delish and full of beef-y goodness but the fish tacos were a little on the bland side for flavor.  Chicken burrito was a hearty size.  Margaritas were tart, refreshing and took our minds off the -25 degree weather outside.  Could have definitely used a few more chips in the basket with the guacamole order...we ran out and still had guac left which I shamelessly dipped my tacos into.

A good meal and a fun atmosphere that took us South of the border and back without anyone getting Montezuma's Revenge.  Arriba, arriba!
