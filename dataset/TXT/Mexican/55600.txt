9YnK_lZ7lInd81BURIk3Ew I've visited this location many times with friends. I'm not a huge fan of their food to begin with, but this location is convenient. Recently, I went in wishing to purchase a kids quesadilla. No I'm not a child, but their small quesadilla was more money than I wanted to spend and more food than I wanted to eat. I was told since I was not 12 or under, I could not purchase this meal. I think this is absolutely stupid. I'm giving you money for food why does it matter how old I am? How do you know I wasn't buying it for a child? I also find this a lie because 2 days prior when I was eating at this location with friends, my friend ordered and received a kids quesadilla...and she is older than me. I will not be purchasing anything for this location in the future due to these "rules" and clearly lies told by the staff. Not only did they lose my sale that day, they lost my business for life.

A friend of mine just ate at this location today and ordered a kids quesadilla. This place needs to get their policies straight.
