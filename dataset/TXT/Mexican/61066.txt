arpBUwgiaE8iqfNGMQ_hgg If you like Burritos and you are in the area you should check this Big Fat Burrito branch as it never disappointed me. Always consistent, always good.
The atmosphere is great and the only drawback is the parking. it's in the kensington market so parking is always hard to come by.
Worth the hassle though.
