CLthP1yn32xlBswIbsLIjQ This place is the bomb, my manager and I been ordering food here for lunch. Everything we have ordered from here is so delicious. I'm not a taco eater but this one is acceptable. Definitely recommend for a bite to eat while out with your friends or want to spend some time with your significant other. And that taco supreme is to die for hahaha I love it mmmmm
