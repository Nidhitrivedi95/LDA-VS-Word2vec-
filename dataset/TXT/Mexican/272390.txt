wTNWq7jrCZD1q2hSjUtTXg Went to this Si Senor location recently.  Service was prompt and the food was as expected. The salsa was ok, a little runny in my opinion. I enjoyed my fajitas and appreciated that they were able to take out the mushrooms.  The beans and rice could've been flavored a bit more, but overall, I was satisfied with my meal.  My husband had no complaints about his chimichangas. I particularly enjoyed the queso dip and would recommend ordering that or the guacamole as an additional dip for your chips.  We sat on the inside, but there is also a patio area that is not too close to Detroit Rd so it seemed like it would be an enjoyable option. So why the 3 stars?  There were just a few small differences compared to my local Si Senor restaurant. Again, the food is good and will likely meet your expectations. I would return if I was in the area, but for my next Mexican craving, I'll be returning to the Kamms location.
