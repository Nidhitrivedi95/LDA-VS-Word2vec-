PnXeEQQv0-0F5G24t03iWA I love Moes. Not this Moes. Came for lunch, tofu hadn't even been made yet. It wasn't an early lunch. This happens a lot. Staff was chaotic. Only one person was working, the other two were standing around confused. I ordered the nachos and basically got charged full price for a mostly naked pile of chips with queso added as an after thought after my other toppings. Disappointed. Had I not paid, I'd have just eaten elsewhere but I couldn't bear arguing after waiting so long.
