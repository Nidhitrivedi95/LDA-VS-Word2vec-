v0FdDAXvEYieRWcngbCe1Q Went for a late dinner. Found most of staff just sitting around eating. Had never been here before so we didn't know the routine. No one greeted us so we had no clue. Finally got the food started. Very very sloppy. The staff was waiting for us to say something as we were waiting for them to guide us. We'd go back if the service was better.
