RRtjC-KUE9vSbD09r6is2A Like many in Scottsdale, a patio with misters and margaritas is like catnip.  However, Salty clearly knows this to lure patrons in.  The food is below average, my friend almost puked on fish tacos.  They have a wide variety of margaritas..even one for $195. Really? You have to be pretty drunk and an idiot to drop that cash at this place for 1 drink. The patio is nice if you just want to drink Corona's or beers and the service is pretty decent.
