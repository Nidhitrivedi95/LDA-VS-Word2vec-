etGW0g4oIABVeC4Sk5YBDQ This Taco Bell is by far the worst I have ever been to. They are lazy and constantly get my order wrong. I've seen inside the back door and the kitchen seems to always be dirty. My husband and I would rather drive an extra 5 miles to a different location then to ever go back here again.
