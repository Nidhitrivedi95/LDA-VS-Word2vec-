NOfbzTpQ7hrt6ZbJVeXUUw What a disappointment. We wanted to have a cold beer and nice lunch on a patio and we certainly picked the wrong place. Bad service, cold food, warm beer. The beer was in a plastic glass and was warm before it even got to the table. We ordered the 16oz hoping it would be in a proper glass and while it did come in a glass it had something floating  in it. Gross! The salsa was.. weird. Slimy is a good description. The sangria was  subpar with practically an entire orange in it. The tacos were "ok" but my boyfriend's were cold. Save your money and time. Choose somewhere else if you want a nice patio in Las Vegas.
