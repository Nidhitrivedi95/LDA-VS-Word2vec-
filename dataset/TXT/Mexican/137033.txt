IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA After wandering the mall for thirty minutes at 9:00pm trying to find a place to eat, Border Grill was a welcomed find. The service was great, and the margaritas were better! I recommend their spicy one over the house margarita! 

We ordered the guacamole, carnitas, fish tacos, and one of the braised pork specials. The rice and beans were great, and I loved the plantains! My only gripe would be it's a little pricey for what you're getting--but hey, that's Vegas.

Tip--check in on Yelp and get a free house margarita!
