k6EQholZjA03b-O6foAPCA I agree that I wish they had stayed independent, but the food is still good!  It's definitely my favorite place to eat Mexican food n Monroeville (if not all of Pittsburgh).  The waitstaff is always pleasant, the prices are good, and the food is good!  The chips and salsa are definitely my favorite... might be going there tonight! :-)  

The chile poblanos are fantastic!  It's also nice that their Mexican rice is vegetarian (others use chicken broth).
