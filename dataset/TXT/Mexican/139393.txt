j0pppFcCeTnmBduZ30gGiA The food is great but we always, always have to make sure we get the right charge when paying for our food there. They charge more than we are supposed to pay, EVERY TIME. Today Saturday, 10/07/17 they charged my beans and cheese taco as a beans and cheese burrito and my husband's shrimp coco taco as a full meal. Because I know the trick already, I checked the bill before paying it. Staff isn't too friendly when I point out the error everytime it happens. The lines are always long there so they have to hold it back while they fix the error. Good food but make sure you check your bill ALWAYS before paying.
