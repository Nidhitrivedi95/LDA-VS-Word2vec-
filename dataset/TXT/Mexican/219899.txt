RHoFn4B0AfyqyWGYFqeSXA This place is as good as it gets for a taco shop. My wife and I are connoisseurs of southern California taco shops. But we never eat at them when we go to vegas. But we got sick of eating at pretentious Vegas restaurants with prices that don't reflect the quality of the experience. So this time around we ate at local dives and hole-in-the-walls. But to call something a "dive" or a "hole-in-the-wall" does not accurately reflect the efforts made by the owners and staff to create a culture of excellence. So sincere thanks to the employees of these independent restaurants. Not only was the food grade at this place, but the servers were friendly and hospitable. The prices were reasonable. And the chili rellenos are among the best I've had a taco shop, and the green chili pork burrito was as good as anything I could get in the Southwest.
