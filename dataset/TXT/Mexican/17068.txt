1HfkEkNhI6XJXkgrCTBKpw This place has an extensive amount of craft beer on tap and some very nice appetizers. unique things here which is great. The fried Brussel sprouts were amazing! For dinner there are only a few choices (which for me is a good thing, that means they do things right instead of mediocre with lots of choices). I wanted the pork belly but they were out of it so I settled for the chicken instead. It was good but not great. I think it made have a bit to do with me eating so many apps and also really wanting the pork belly.

I would definitely try this place again though.
