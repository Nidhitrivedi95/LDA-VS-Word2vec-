j_prxgHnMvuRdrGjAI9qXQ Permanently Closed?  Normally LOVE ZTejas but went for lunch today (Sun Oct 22) and found a sign on the door mentioning landlord eviction - perhaps a dispute on payment of rent?  There were no people and the location was closed up tight.   Not sure what's going on here, but I hope this is not permanent!!!
