XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Let me start by saying that Mesa Grill is one of my favorite upscale/casual dining restaurants in Las Wages. I have been to MG many times and have never been disappointed until my most recent visit. Ordered the Mesa Burger and it was way, waaaaay to salty. I came back the next day for brunch and had the delicious Ranch Style EggsTostada with grits (amazing), the lady sitting next to me at the bar ordered the MG Burger and she complained to the barman that the burger was to salty, informed them I had the same issue the previous day !  That's really the only reason I'm not giving MG a ***** rating, hoping to bring to the attention of current chef & BF the salt issue. Lots of choices in Vegas, but would still highly recommend MG, and will be a repeat diner as long as I don't have the same issue again !
