6eUWcUgULy4xcE8v5L2w5A As Karen N and I left the Luminato show tonight, a man approached us and ask if we like falafel. My first thought was, "who doesn't?" 

Alijandro's Kitchen turns the traditional falafel into waffle cone, a healthy alternative, they say. If you don't pay attention, you'll finish the cone filled with a spicy hummus and well-dressed salad and wonder where the falafel was. 

At $7.50 a pop, it almost seems gimmicky and seems like a better deal to get the other items on the menu where you'd probably be more satisfied with your order. 

While they advertise that the fawaffle is vegan, and diary free, the fawaffle is the only item that is. They also serve an "avo chicken" fawaffle for $10 and a warmed cashew baklava with a scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with pistachios for $5. I tried the baklava, it was ok, the ice cream made the crunch pastry a bit chewy, I'd probably like a slightly bigger dish and have it on the side. 

The experience wasn't bad, but I think the best part of a falafel is that it is fried. So I'll probably stick to that.
