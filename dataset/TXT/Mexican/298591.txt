zJGtD3y-pAIGNId4codEEg I have been to this neighborhood restaurant at least a dozen times.  Its not fancy or unique, but its reliable and the food is good, plus it has cocktails!  Lively atmosphere with friendly service.  Went with one of my friends last night and we only had to wait for a table for about five minutes.  He had fish tacos and I had a chicken burrito...not going to win any dining awards but you will enjoy your meal and surroundings while having some pleasant conversation with your friends.  Oh, I noticed a sign up front that says they are open every day for breakfast now too.
