R1k-z3Mauqk4v-7ZeEVsHQ I went here a couple friday's ago with friends. We all got the same thing the meat and cheese filled papusa meal. I love papusas and this place is legit on these. Im not a fan of black beans so I get the pinto beans with the meal. I ordered the horchata thinking it was going to taste like every other horchata I have had. El salvadorian horchata is not the same as your typical Mexican horcahata, and it was not to my liking. I took some food to go for Javier, but he said he was not a fan, may have been since it was not fresh. Beware when you go to this place, it is straight in the middle of the hood and looks sketchy. You drive to the back and park in the dark parking lot and enter through the back. Do not let this scare you away because the food is worth it.
