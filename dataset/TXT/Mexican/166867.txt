LQZ2yBIAFmXYbDD0Z2Nhug I don't see why such bad reviews. Either I'm off my rocker or have crappy taste buds. Some of the reviewers should have honestly lowered their expectations and been a bit more fair to this company. It's a food court, no your tacos will not be brought out to you from the finest chef in Mexico City. It WILL be cooked and ordered through great people who were super friendly and happy to help as needed. It's a bit pricey but it's on the Strip. I'm a local and know better deals but I liked the food. I was going to get tacos for $9 or so but a $16 combo includes a side and drink and any entree. Sooooooo I got the more expensive burrito for the all in cost. *brushing shoulders off* Chips and Queso was good, burrito was filling.
