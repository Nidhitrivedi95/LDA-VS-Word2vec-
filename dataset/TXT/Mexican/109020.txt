frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A First time coming here! It sounds like they expanded a few months ago to accommodate for the traffic they were getting. There was constant people coming in and out even with the odd time we were there. Even though they were busy the service was fast and friendly. 
They had tons of different Taco options. They had a good variety of vegan, vegetarian, seafood and a salsa bar to woo any salsa lover. I got the 3 street Taco plater the flavor was good only complaint was that some of the meat was dried out which I had to pick out. My husband got some seafood Tacos that he picked here and there. Overall it was a fun experience but I think there are better restaurants to try.
