6qP6R78nlAGSahx78DayHQ One star for the awesome cashier who felt bad and gave me a free beverage but... It really shouldn't take 15 minutes to get one grilled stuff burrito and when a guy who's wearing a paramedic uniform comes in and orders to go it means that he can't wait too long for food. It wouldn't burn me up so much but people who ordered after me got their food first. So based on my experience I'm guessing that Taco Bell hates first responders and does not want our business.
