BmyRJmbVm4jGlkXg4ncLJQ I understand this is a new restaurant, but the quality of the food and service was very low. I'm guessing they do not have a lot of experience. The food was below average (if you've had good or home cooked Mexican food you will understand). The server put her finger in my plate as she was handing it to me and there was no music playing which made it an overall bland experience.
