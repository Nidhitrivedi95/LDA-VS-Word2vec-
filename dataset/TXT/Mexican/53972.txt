9Q1ZtzTPFWG4fJiFSko5Xg Cantina Laredo is a bit pricy but is a nice treat. I've eaten here several times and almost always get the enchiladas Veracruz with a cabo flip margarita. Happy hour is great too but only available in the bar. The case Rita is $5 on happy hour, it's not bad but not good as the flip. Also have had the carnitas sliders, shrimp empanadas, and the fajita tacos off the happy hour menu all are good but would pass on the fajita tacos in the future because there was nothing special about them. The shrimp empanadas were fantastic though. The guacamole is good but pricy and I've tasted the enchiladas de mole and thought it was pretty good as well.
