tqxS-gA5zhBvdI5lk7kDGg I love your original location so I decided to try the new, larger downtown location. I must say, I'm impressed! The location is much more roomie and completely different. The decor is very simple and elegant. Not exactly what I would think about from Mexican. I know you just opened but i'd like to see a touch more personality in the decor! The walls are kind of bare as of now. 

The food is still amazing. I got the potato flautas. I wanted to mix and match but was told I couldn't. Either way, they are perfectly seasoned and really unique tasting, full of flavor. The margarita was also great. Keep up the good work Maize!
