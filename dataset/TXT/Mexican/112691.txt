G8LBVca1vOBKYeMCMpajGA Food is ok and plenty of it.  Service on the other hand, not so good.  I changed my mind on what I wanted and the cashier was protesting.  I said thank you like for times and she didn't reply a "you are welcome" a "no problem"' nothing!  Very rude.  When in Vegas, will never come back here.  I also asked for my kids tacos to be plain and I heard the guy preparing the tacos asking why I wanted my tacos plain, seriously?!?!?!?  This place seriously put me in a bad mood.
