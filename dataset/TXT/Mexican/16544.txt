1dQqNZOjsXRx-UgJD0dpRg I am a gringo so I usually have a problem with Mexican food. But Don Jose's is perfection. I usually have the Carne Asada  and it is delicious every time. The fish tacos are huge! The wait is minimal and the staff is friendly. When I crave Mexican food I go to Don Jose's. Some day I might have the guts to order #20
