iOt7ebp4Zy-5YUjHL1rbmQ Who wants really good carne asada? You know that thin, marinated, juicy meat with a smoky flavor having just come off the grill. When you're not cooking it up in your own backyard, you should come check this place out. 

I came here with Erin S. on the second day of the grand opening week. The VIBE was sort of that modern fast casual feeling with rustic touches. The space is quite large and boasts a sizable patio. 

The FOOD was delicious. I ordered the carne asada burrito and it filled me up good. The meat is succulent and tender, not chewy. Some other places you have to beware of those bites of carne that could go on for days. They deliver a good size burrito that's packed with mostly meat along with cabbage, onions, and red tomato sauce. This goes the same for the tacos which I can imagine are just as yummy. We ordered a side of frijoles (beans) which were tasty but not particularly remarkable. I intend to come by to check out the chicken and birria (shredded beef). I heard many good things about these other options while waiting in line, but a man only has one stomach. 

Take your pick from the MENU:
- Tacos
- Quesadillas
- Crazy Potato
- Grilled Gordita
- Grilled Tostada
- Burritos
- Chips and Salsa

They also offer a nice selection of Mexican bottled sodas, horchata, limonada, and jaimaca. 

The WAIT was bad - almost an hour. I chalk this one up to the fact the location just opened and they're working out the kinks. The volume of customers had to be slowing them down too. So, I'll give it some time before I return. Hopefully, they will have the drive-thru working by then!
