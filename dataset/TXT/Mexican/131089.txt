iBlQvqiy5Rg2h-y9TS1yOA Best Mexican Restaurant I have tried off the strip! My husband and I enjoy our Mexican food, and there are a lot of options in Las Vegas. I am sure there are some amazing options on the strip, but I don't want to drive to the strip or pay the strip premium. We have been on the hunt for a good sit down Mexican restaurant since we moved here in May. We have found the one we will be eating at, even though it's on the opposite side of town! 

The carne asada tacos are amazing and their tequila menu impressive. :)
