n-n2l3VyENfM6nr8IXAObw Place is good and authentic. Service was good. Different variants on tacos than a traditional American Mexican restaurant. Meats were a tad dry. The  price point is a little high for what you get in my opinion, everything seems to be an extra charge. 

For a similar option with better pricing (kids eat free on Sunday) and atmosphere I would try Zapata's in Ballantyne. If you go there and don't enjoy your meal you are probably ordering the wrong thing.
