SW6ZQk22G1_CV81_gfnvNQ great ambiance. great service. 
portion is not very large. 
Tried Mexican rice milk, Horchata. Tastes like milk but not as rich. Liked the taste of cinnamon in it! $3.75
Avocado Mango salad is rather refreshing. Delicious but a little pricey $9
In Cod We Trust is tasty! Cod is very crispy but not greasy. Liked the sauce on it. My friend had the one w/ beef cheek, she said it was very tasty. Both $4.75, reasonable enough
Churros were good, I prefer the cajeta dip tho!
Will return to try more items.
