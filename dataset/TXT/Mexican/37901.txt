6-IfbXLjCYBw03WJqoV9CA Absolutely God awful food and service!!! 12$ for a cheese burrito with cold chips add 1$ for salsa wow! Service was beyond terrible never asked chicken or steak just started putting stuff on my burrito! They were out of chips so they got some from the back that were freezing cold! Absolutely do not recommend this place to anyone! The food was so bad and I was so frustrated with the service that I couldn't even eat! No stars!!!!!! This place will close down soon and for good reason!!
