KwufI-XUy8Vs2cnJ8n7F6w I remember El Pollo Loco from living in California. Since I've seen this location under construction for some time, I was surprised to find it open today. Looks like they will officially open on Monday 6/12/17. Today, they were in the midst of training employees and giving food/drinks away for free. What a great idea! I ordered double chicken bowl Togo and it tasted yummy and so fresh. It came with fresh tortilla and salsa/guacamole. I will return when they officially open, thanks for the food!
