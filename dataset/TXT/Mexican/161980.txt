l0Gop1Hu8XJYpHHCpvG6SA Just came in for the shrimp cocktail and it was delicious. The location is clean and the staff is very attentive. Glad their is a location like this in Henderson /whitney ranch aree because robertos does not compare. I did notice the prices for the mariscos are higher than nearby locations and portions smaller but I figured it must be due to the location. But if you don't want to drive so far and live in the Henderson area I do recommend this place.
