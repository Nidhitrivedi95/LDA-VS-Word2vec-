MAuSh7NKoT__CQ4BumoayA Margaritas are not that good. Super sugary and full of sour mix which is allegedly per the menu just "lime juice and pure agave".  Didn't get food but it looked decent. Another random note, the menus were really cheesy looking and were oddly sticky. Gross. Staff/bartenders were nice.
