vY8-P5aeFO4xRoH_mUfQ9A Despite the excruciatingly slow service, I actually liked this place.

My boyfriend and I went on Friday night around 9pm. It wasn't very busy and we were seated right away. I really liked the interior--a CLEAN "Mexican" restaurant (I use the term "Mexican" very loosely here)! As soon as our server came to greet us, we immediately put in an appetizer (the dip and dunk) and our drinks. Our drinks took waaaay too long, although I appreciated the fact that after about 10 mins our server came over and explained to us the drink I ordered (the grimace martini) had never been made before, so it's taking extra time to make it. Eh, who knows; at least he had the balls to come over and explain why the drinks were taking so long instead of just ignoring us and pretending everything was okay. 

The appetizer took about 30 minutes to come out (which wasn't a huge deal because my bf and I are pretty laid back, we weren't in a rush, and they have free chips n salsa), but the manager who delivered our food apologized for the wait. The dip and dunk, which consists of mini chimis and mini quesadillas that you can dip/dunk into three different dips (pinto bean dip, black bean dip, or pico). It was good and nicely presented, at $7 definitely worth the price IMO. 

The entrees came out not too long after, bf had the beef chimichanga w/rice and I had the chicken enchiladas w/rice. Both were good, although we had to take most of it home because we were STUFFED from all the chips/salsa and our app. 

Our bill not including the tip for 2 drinks, 1 appetizer, and 2 entrees came to $43, which I don't think is bad at all for a nice dinner out with lots of leftovers for lunch the next day. It's not exactly authentic, but I enjoyed it!
