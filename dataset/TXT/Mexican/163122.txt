LDfwOLcQMASCS-MWXFPsCw I would go here with my coworkers once a week for lunch because the food is great, quick service, and at great prices. 

I usually have a small appetite for lunch so my go-to-order was the taco loco (one taco with rice, refried beans, beef or chicken, lettuce, cheese and topped off with guacamole) which was only around $4 and it filled me up! They also give out nachos in the beginning with a choice of sauces. The chimichanga is also delicious, and I usually always have leftovers when I order that. 

This place is different from other Mexican restaurants in that they don't overdue it on the spices, every ingredient is fresh and simple and when it's all blended/put together it's a melody of awesomeness.
