aWYWNfHuQJyRwDHaHq8X1w Arrrrggg I have instant brain pain whenever I'm invited to Tex Tubb's.  I can't grasp the reality of this being one of the go-to places in Madison.  It's by far the worst of all the Food Fight establishments.  But it's also the perfect fit for Food Fight.  Tex Mex on a whole a very bland genre of food.  But cheap frozen margaritas don't entice me because I'm not a lush or a moron.  If I want tacos I'll go to a real Mexican place.  But my idea of dining isn't a poorly lit party type atmosphere.  I'm not loud and obnoxious and I don't slam shots in between the bites of my burrito. 

I should make it clear though that I'm very grateful for Food Fight's existence.  If it wasn't a Tex Tubb's it would be an Iguana Mia, Chi Chi's or some other Darden crap chain and at least Food Fight is local.   And I do appreciate Monty's....
