aXRrMXXoAN7lawHICgmsxw This place is cute.  It's very unassuming.  The food menu is small, which I appreciate.  The drink menu is longer.  I only had ice tea. 

I got the Roro burger.  Was in an English muffin.  I actually really liked it.  A hint of spice and tang! The French fries were super good, they were seasoned with something I can't place, but as a whole, the meal was great.

The churro ice cream sammich - yas gawd!  Was a great ending to my lunch.

The staff is super nice, but disappeared a lot. And it wasn't one person who took our order, or gave us our check, or took our money. That was the only bummer I experienced.
