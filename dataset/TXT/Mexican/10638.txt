_XN-GwzZwAyIqLKJsl2htg We've been going here since it opened. If i had written the review last year I would have definitely given them 5 stars. Food was always amazing as well as the service. I have to say, in the past few months the food tastes different. Not everything, but most items we have ordered no longer taste like they used to. The waiter suggested that it possibly has to do with some items now being gluten free?? The only item that still tastes the same and is delicious is the bacon guacamole. Always amazing and I highly recommend trying it! Everything is just blah. The service the past few times we've been has been soso.
