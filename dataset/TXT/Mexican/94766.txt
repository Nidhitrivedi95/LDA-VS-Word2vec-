EAFuhvRxoAhYARuiXCsUSw Great food, great service, and great price.  I have been to a lot of Mexican restaurants in the Cleveland area, and Dos Coronas tops my list.  Food comes out hot and quick.  Staff is helpful and friendly.  The chips and salsa come immediately upon arrival.  Besides the food the restaurant and facilities are kept very clean.
