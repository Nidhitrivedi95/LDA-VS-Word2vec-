70WDApYtMcLlrnb1EUW6fg Service was awful. I work in the industry and we have been coming to la hacienda every year for our wedding anniversary and over the years have notice the service and food quality declining and prices increasing.  My husband told the hostess it was our anniversary because they asked and not one person even acknowledged it. Why ask is we are celebrating something special?!? We order what used to be table side guacamole and now they basically just mashed it at the table, that was $15. $14 for maybe an half an ounce of tequila in my margarita. We then ordered the fajitas to split for $27 they came with 3 tortillas and when we asked for more they never mentioned anything to us but charged us $3!!! This place used to be so special but it's looks like we will be trying bourbon steak next year. Adios !
