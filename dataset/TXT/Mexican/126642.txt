hVC6E29dg5Rx4ADSxt3kTA I have been visiting Restaurant Mexico since I was in college. Whenever I am in town on business, I go there. It is fantastic. As to the lower starred reviews, take those with a grain of salt. If not two grains of salt. Comparing authentic Mexican cuisine with Filiberto's is like comparing Nordstrom's to Walmart. (RM is obviously more Nordstrom's).
