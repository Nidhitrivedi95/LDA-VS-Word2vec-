SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA It's been too long since I've had a flaming fajita.   Portions are very generous, prices are fair, and nice atmosphere.   I always get the steak fajitas for two and split it with the wife.   Super tasty.   Don't need to go into much detail but everything is flavorful and they give you chips with bean dip and salsa when you get to the table.  Plus they re-fill them no questions asked.  

With the meal they give you a generous helping of beans, rice, guac, sour cream and cheese.   They light your fajitas up when they get to your table.   The 5 foot flame that come from it gives you a quality wake up before it's time to eat.
