arpBUwgiaE8iqfNGMQ_hgg We were disappointed in our burritos after revisiting the popular spot specializing in large extra value portions with a nice choice of toppings. The atmosphere reminded me of a greasy food stand at the Ex with no one in charge. After looking over the menu of toppings and wondering what was a good choice, they said, 'what do you NOT want on it?' Not a very appetizing prospect. The burrito was a mushy mess and the yams were stringy and not pleasant. There are better places to eat in the Market, like recently opened Doner Mania.
