MmQsPiVSN08WtmlsC_ZSVA Met the owner today,  she was the cashier.  You have to respect a owner that takes pride,  and will work at her business.  She was just lovley.  Never have I been here and ever had a rude person.  They are always friendly with a smile on their face.  I still get annoyed with DB, their patrons just dont get it.  Stop blocking the driveway.  However the food is totally worth it!!
