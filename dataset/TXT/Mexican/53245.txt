9o-DUVGYaoKkqnCP5BT_NA Very good Mexican food. Authentic, fairly affordable, and generous portions. Get the hard tacos! Seriously, one of the better places out there.

The only reason why it loses a star is because the inside of the restaurant is very old and dated, the tables are often sticky, and the restroom looks like it hadn't been cleaned in years.
