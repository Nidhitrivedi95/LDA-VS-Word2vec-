zFgRaWBwD8LY80IOqphSpQ We stopped here for an early dinner after hiking South Mountain and it was awesome.  We tried the sopas, nachos, empanadas, bean and cheese burrito and quesadilla-we were pretty hungry. My son had the horchata and it was magical. Can't wait to come back and try more stuff. The lady who was working there was also incredibly kind and helpful.
