iBlQvqiy5Rg2h-y9TS1yOA The food was not great, service was average. Went there opening weekend and the place is very loud due to the high ceilings,  forgot to bring my wife's iced tea, the rice, as I've heard in the reviews was overcooked and crispy and the beans were tasteless..you had to pay for chips and salsa and the one server put lit candles behind our table on the ledge to where if we leaned back, we would have caught our hair on fire. Price paid per portion was way too high. If you want the best Mexican food in downtown summerlin, go to panchos or visas on fort apache and sahara. Would not recommend this place at all.
