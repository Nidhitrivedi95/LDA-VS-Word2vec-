lF3klLu44Jaq3UqO9a50Pg Very Good Mexican Seafood restaurant. Everything we ordered was SO YUMMY!!!. For drinks, we ordered the Watermelon Sangria. It really came in a half size Watermelon shell with chunk of Watermelon inside, red sauce around it ...great for sharing. So Good and Tasty!!!  
The clams with shrimp was So Yummy. Wish we ordered more of it.
Then we had the Mix Seafood Pot. It had the whole fry fish, big shrimp, octopus, etc.... Had a creamy sauce inside pot. Very Good!!! Lots of favor. 
The seafood with bread was delicious.   Buttery bread, shrimp and octopus stir fry with onions, bell pepper and potatoes and side of calamari. Love it!!
This is my new favorite Mexican Seafood restaurant. I would definitely come back here.
