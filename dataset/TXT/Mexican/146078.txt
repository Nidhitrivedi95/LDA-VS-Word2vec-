jIzygnVmajEXYmfsBNY_Gw I love the tacos here. I am giving three stars because the last time I went, the service was awful. The place is like a Chipotle where you tell them what you want on your taco or burrito. I requested beans on my taco...the guy making my taco actually said "tacos don't get beans." I was like, my tacos do. He refused to give them to me! Then, I requested a real plate instead of the mini styrofoam tray that they give you. He told me, "no." While my friend ordered ahead of me, she was given a real plate for her food. I was like, is this a joke? I went back later to say something to the guy about it and he was glued to his phone. Then he tells me, "my boss is here, that's why I didn't give you the beans." I'm like, your boss is here, that's why you refuse a customer's request and are glued to your phone?? Yeah, makes a lot of sense. Really disappointed with the awful service and it makes me not want to return.
