WOz66UuVsfc2K9GxzfDnGg Yikes! My neighborhood has a "FOOD" thief in it!  I was robbed!  I stopped going to America's taco shop after trying it a few times when I lived in the Roosevelt hood.  Now i make my home in the Coronado hood and felt I would give it another try. So for the past few weeks, I ran over a few blocks to grab some grub.  I ordered the carne asada burrito.  Same old burrito as before, undercooked tortilla, carne asada was GOOD, but barely any of it.  It was lunch time so I gave the cooks the benefit of doubt. Til the next week, I had a burrito and pastor tacos,  and the same thing as above.  The meat is GOOD, but I walked away feeling I missed something.  Oh!  Could it be the MEAT!  Tonight, I go up the street again. Why do I do this to myself, SHAME ON ME,  I know better.  I grabbed the special of the evening the torta pastor.  Torta has a big bun lots of flavorless green mayo (was that suppose to be avocado), and NO MEAT!  Okay 1/2 of cup of meat...it was GOOD meat, but in the words of Wendy's...Where's the beef?   I feel robbed,  my good green money was stolen and I handed it over to the "FOOD" thief in the little yellow house.  Bummer neighbor, bummer.

Where's a good roach coach when you need it?
