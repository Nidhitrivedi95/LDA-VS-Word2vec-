R7LyTeiOHLyTNkA8HssBRQ Absolutely outstanding service from the male dayshift cashier! He absolutely deserves a raise - otherwise I'll hire him as a salesman for my company! I ordered the veggie tacos and he volunteered all of the options available to me without me even asking. Asked if I'd like rice, peppers and onions, and lettuce added to my veggie taco. Was wonderful and pleasant without seeming desperate for a tip (which of course I gave him). Great staffing Los Tacos!! I'll be back to see him!
