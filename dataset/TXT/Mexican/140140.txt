J7B-hSSYDYSIQx5xiqOJTw My wife and I recently ate at Pacos Tacos. We have ate at Burntwood Taverns and M Italian so we were excited to try it. We ordered the $9 guacamole which was sent back because the avocados were not ripe. The lobster quesadilla was oily and the enchiladas were smothered in sauce. The carne asada tacos were probably the best item we had but the portion was not enough. To be honest it's just a middle of the road Mexican restaurant. I had higher expectations for the Burntwood Group.
