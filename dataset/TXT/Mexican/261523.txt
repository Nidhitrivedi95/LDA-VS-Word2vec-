VuIIfIAEtGFXcAcXCvK-1g Such a great addition to Cave Creek/Carefree area!  The burritos are fabulous...they will open their larger restaurant  the first week of May.  They have a few tables outside, and a bar area to sit at inside, but it is pretty much a take out place right now.  The food is delicious and we are SO happy they are here!  Can't wait for the bigger restaurant that is right next door to open.  Highly recommend!
