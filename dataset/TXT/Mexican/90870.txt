DYGCzsHi7pT4AAe8kh5Dug This chain is not highly represented in Canada. yet.  As usual for American chains that have moved here, the prices are considerably higher than in the states, but the food is pretty much the same as I remember Chipotle from Chicago.  This one could use a bit better seating and a little more attention to table cleaning, but the American-Mex (this stuff is not really Mexican) fast food is fresh and good.
