N5CL5HLS6lyltw-OjjBrOw So I was invited here again! We were seated and served by Zach, the service from him was friendly and attentive. 

This time I made sure to try some different things. We ordered a 3 taco plate with two fried fish tacos & a vegan 'fish' taco which came with rice and beans, a regular margarita, sangría, chips and salsa, and the vegan chocolate cake. 

I really enjoyed the fish tacos and I recommend them over the other meats such as beef, chicken and pork.
Also the vegan fish taco makes a pretty good substitute for fish. I'd order it again! 
One thing we weren't a fan of was the rice. My brother mentioned that the rice tasted like instant rice and after that we didn't really touch it. 

The chips and salsa and guacamole were all good. The chips were light and airy, out of the three salsas that came with it we enjoyed the Chipotle one the most because of its smokey sweet flavor. We got that one refilled a few times. 

As for the drinks, we ordered about three margaritas. Honestly the margaritas here are so good. It's perfectly sour, salty and sweet. I'd come back to hussong's just for them. :) They have other flavor options available too but I stuck to the original because I knew it was good. 

My brother got a sangria which I tasted and it was OK! I have to say I prefer the ones at firefly a lot more. I'll stick to the margaritas!

We finished with the vegan chocolate cake again, I really like the flavor of the pb frosting and the sour tomatillo sauce. :) 

Prices are very reasonable, if you go at the right time. 3 of us ate and drank for around $60+tip. Not bad at all! 

This place has a nice vibe with the outdoor patio. I'll definitely come back for some fish tacos and margaritas some time.
