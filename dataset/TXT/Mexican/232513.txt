Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg My opinion changes for the best everytime I go into this restaurant. The very first time I ate there I ordered this "goat soup" which its main ingredients are goat and beer. It was not appetizing at all! To each their own though. The last few times I dined there I was pleasantly please with the service, the the time it took for the food to arrive and the food itself. There are only a few good Mexican restaurants in town I enjoy going to and this is one of them.
