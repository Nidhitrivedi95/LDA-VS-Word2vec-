I25YFbDL16lVcutPMNIlHA Food is pretty good. The grilled chicken in the tacos is fantastic.  

Not sure why there is a fence around the front door. Lose that. Also not sure why there is table service for lunch. A lot of people just want to counter-order for lunch. 

Nice salsa bar. 
I'm coming back.
