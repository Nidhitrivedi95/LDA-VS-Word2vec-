p-qvtajJfi19y3Oz-pa9_A I had the tacos al carbon platter and it was very good for the price. Appearance wise, It did not look quite as nice as the picture posted by the business owner, but overall it tasted fresh and the chicken was seasoned well. I also enjoyed their complementary fresh tomato salsa and green salsa.
