LpVNpw2-Bn9iHVON33auKw What can I say about this place, AVOID IT AT ALL COST.... horrible service.. we ordered carna asada fries and it was a mess. Processed nacho cheese and the steak was awful. I can't even eat it. 

My daughter ordered 2 tacos one beef and chicken and half way through the beef taco she said she was done and that it was my fault we should have went to filabertos. I agreed and tossed the food in the trash
