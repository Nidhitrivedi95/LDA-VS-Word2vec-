lv5Bnqlt93NnvNJ2oNcQ8Q This was my first visit to this restaurant and my husband's second time. The hostess greeted us with a big simile and seated us at the patio, which is enclosed so it made it even better since it was a bit chilly outside. The restaurant had a clean and rustic Mexican theme decor and Obeisance to it. The waitress Adriana and Maria where both very sweet and additive to our table. The manager came over and introduced him self and asked if everything was good, of course it was and invited us to their grand opening on Friday Jan 6, 2017. I had the fish  tacos,it was absolutely delicious, with fresh Hand made tortillas and tomatillos cream sauce, and grill fish. It also came with fresh bean stew and white rice with some carrots and green onions in it. My husband had the rib eye steak dinner he really enjoyed his dish. Cooked perfect. The staff was all friendly and kind. Our water and soft drinks never went empty, top notch service.
