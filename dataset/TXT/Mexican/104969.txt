FI-8LPGkc8D_hwx0l0zyyg The greatest place for a girls brunch or co-ed get together. Our waitress Josie was so warm and detail oriented that we could not have asked for anything better, but then our drinks and appetizers were brought by cute men which was fun also. Big long bar and shared seating tables is so fun but outdoor patio is intimate and adorable as well. Highly recommended!
