The rice with the torta was overcooked to the point of not being edible. The beans tasted bland and fattening. I asked for jalapenos and they didn't have any. The "carne asada" on the torta had so little meat you could barely see it. Half the tiny sandwich meat was fat, no exaggeration. The tomatoe slices were relatively fresh at least. Essentially I could not eat my meal. The chicken bowl rice was also overcooked. The chicken was bland. If I could give the restaurant a negative score, I would. See my other reviews if you want to see if I am too hard on other restaurants (I have given all other reviews 4 or 5 stars).  I should go back and ask for my money back but it is quite obvious the managers and owners of this establishment couldn't care less.  I dare you to respond. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!
