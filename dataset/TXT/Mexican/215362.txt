QYuojrlW94mpEwnp0uUIWA LOVE this place BUT I do wish they would create a kid's menu.  They should also invest in a soda machine and carry iced tea.  I ordered a coffee shake but our waitress said that there was no coffee available.  Disappointing, knowing that I'm sure they have coffee available for their breakfast customers.  Overall though the staff is very friendly and the food is delicious.
