jppxrDQLXr4Nk8cV7IGlcw Very disappointed. Way over priced. We waited forever after we ordered without ever being checked on or told why our appetizer was taking so long. The cheese dip came out semi melted and completely plain. The fajitas came out just on a plate not on one of those sizzling hot plates. Service was not very good. They at least comped the cheese dip. They were very unorganized and I don't recommend going there.
