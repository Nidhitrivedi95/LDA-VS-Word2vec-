XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg There are two sides to this story.  His side (mine) and her side.
Her side.
She liked the corn soup.  The lamb salad was good.  The lamb was cooked very well but it was way over seasoned even for me.

His side.
I had the sweet potato hash.  Kind of a New Mexico spin on eggs Benedict.

I expected the spice and seasoning to be over the top so I was not surprised by this.  I liked the flavor of the hash and the chili's with the spicy chicken.  I was surprised at the portion of the eggs.  I was fully expecting a "Celebrity" chef portion of food and was quit happy with the amount of food that I got.

I hear complaints from people on Yelp about quantity and price here.  It is Bobby Flay!  I fully expect small portions, high prices but also quality.  I was happy with the quality of the food we got I was happy with the service as well.

As Bobby, we are on a first name basis now, is known for grilling I will have to come back and try a steak as I had brunch.    If he cooks the steak as well as he cooks the lamb I am sure I will be happy.

All in all it was a pleasant meal.  To much "rub" on the lamb for both of us but the hash was excellent.

Only the truth!
