CsS9WsonGYyE3vINi5bxSg I've been here twice, once before the menu changed and then again last night.
The food both times was very good! I'm a fan of just about all the tried tacos, the ceviche, the grilled calamari, all tasted great. The cocktails were also very good.

The menu in my opinion was difficult to read and although the old menu on the wall wasn't easy to read from certain seats in the restaurant, I preferred it thanks to it's simplicity. The new menu seemed cluttered and overwhelming much like the restaurant can feel when it's busy.

The tables are very very small. Too small for two people when the food is coming out of the kitchen every 3 mins. The service was so friendly, I would suggest that the wait staff ask us if we want the food altogether (too much for the table) or to come out little by little.
I appreciated how quickly the food arrived but it was stressful to try to make space with the people at our next table just inches away staring while we struggled. 
We ordered ceviche, (two bowls, one for chips and one for the dish) calamari, two tacos each, cocktails plus the water & jug and a dish on the table for sauce etc. There was not enough room. 

So the point is, order as you eat or you'll have food on your lap with a displacement server (not the friendly wait staff but the actual food server) who doesn't seem to realize there's no room. 

Otherwise a great visit. I'll go back.
