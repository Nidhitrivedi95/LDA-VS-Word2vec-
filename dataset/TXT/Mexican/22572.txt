2IvrdAb6zdxr3ZqplqJHbg I read the reviews and I still ate here.  Yuck!!!  I had the fish tacos.  They are now sitting in my gut like a sack of rocks.  If you have to eat, pass on this place.  With all the fantastic restaurants in Vegas, the selection and quality of restaurants in Terminal C is lacking. If I could give negative stars, I would.
