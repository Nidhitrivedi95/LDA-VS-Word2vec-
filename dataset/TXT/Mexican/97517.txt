EjzMHfwqAmj7BgdzQjquRQ Bandito Latin Kitchen is about a mile off the main strip and has plenty of parking.  We went for an early dinner, so there were not a lot of other customers.  The ambience was very nice and comfortable.  Almost anywhere you sit there are good panoramic views of the area around the restaurant.  This is due to the openness of seating and windows all around, which also allows a great deal of natural light.

We were seated almost immediately (reservations are great) and our server was very attentive.  She made the experience enjoyable and was very willing to guide us through the menu.

Now to the most important part, the food.  We had the carnitas and the carne asada tacos, they were both very good.  The sides were beans, rice and something akin to pico de gallo but with cherry tomatoes.  The beans and rice were passable but not great and the pico was interesting.  We also had drinks (Mojitos) and those were also good.


Overall, we would recommend this restaurant for an enjoyable dinner away from all the crowds of the Vegas strip.
