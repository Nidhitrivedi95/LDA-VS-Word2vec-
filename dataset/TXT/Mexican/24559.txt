Went in out of the blue on the way to Arby's -___- but seeing as how the building used to house my favorite nacho spot in the city (super burrito) I decided to return to this weird shack of a building. I am so glad I did, their Tacos Al Pastor combined with the sauce they put in the taco is so ridiculously good, I'd compare it to Tacos El Gordo. I love you weird shack of deliciousness and I hope this business stays open.
