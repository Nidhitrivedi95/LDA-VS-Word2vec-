eSENXDnnNSo-MLLkWJQ8Vg I've tried a handful of different plates. Everything I've tried so far is good. They have a great selection of salsas. Some have a kick some don't but they are all good. Besides the constant reggae playing in the background the atmosphere is good. One thing I will say and hope you take my advice on is ORDER El Gaucho Quesadilla. If you ordered anything else you gone screwed up. Leave, come back and order El Gaucho Quesadilla. As you consume the best thing on the menu you will instantly feel regret for ordering anything else as well as regret for never being able to order anything else on the menu. I wanted to give this place 4 stars but El Gaucho is well worth the 5th star alone.

(Update 3/21/16) They seemed to have ditched the reggae for Spanish Rock! I mean Jaguares/Caifanes etc.  Definitely a 5 star establishment.
