_FXa_6j-6UDsxWo-KX7WvQ Love this place. They make real New Mexican (S. New Mexico) food. Love getting the carna asada tacos. The hatch red is SO good.  let does get a little busy around lunch time but it is woth the 5 minute wait.  I haven't been here for breakfast but their nachos are so good. Big enoung for two. I get them and my 4 kids can't finish them.
