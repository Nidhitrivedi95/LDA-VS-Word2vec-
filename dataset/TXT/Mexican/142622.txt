JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg Soooo let's talk guacamole and flan. Bring 3-4 people for the guac and watch as they prepare it table side. You decide how much heat you want in your guac just like in your life so if you like it Muy Caliente like you like your women or men get a 10!

Now the flan. Ohhh the heavenly flan. It's like a hybrid between a nice rich cheesecake with the nice caramelized finish of flan without even a hint of egginess. If you like creme brulee this is like a thicker version with liquid caramel.

Oh yes and Chef Paco came out to talk to us.  Got to love that! Sorry to my friends stuck back in VA, it's his grandma's recipe and I'll bet it stays in the family.

UPDATE: the guacamole made me get sick. Also, or waitress tried to pull a fast one over on us! She brought our check which showed $14 then took the credit card and charged $24!!!!!!! We had to get them to fix it and they returned with the receipt but no credit card. My mom didn't notice it was gone and had to go the next day to retrieve it!
