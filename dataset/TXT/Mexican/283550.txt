The shrimp tamale was phenomenal, with layered flavors enhancing the perfectly prepared shrimp and corn.  The rabbit paired with israeli cous cous was one of the best dishes I have ever had.  I am not sue how to describe it, other than be sure that someone at your table gets it.

Mesa Grill is definitely worth the money if you are looking for interesting eats!!!
