48PJznErl0Yj9vGzcb0lwg I have been coming here for years with my family and friends, and this place never disappoints me. They are always welcoming and friendly as soon as you come in the door. 
I recommend the cheese dip to go with the chips they bring you, and pico de gallo. The fiesta chimichanga and the chicken fajitas are wonderful dishes here, and they give you a yummy complementary dessert with every meal (just a fried chip with cinnamon sugar, strawberry sauce, and whipped cream). 
OH, and the margaritas. They are huge - like fishbowl huge. And SO GOOD.
