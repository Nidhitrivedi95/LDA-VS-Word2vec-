daqYMX3Y4QR8xl-BUlYBPw My friend and I met for lunch a few weeks ago. I was not sure what to get but I ended up ordering a burrito combo. It was good and I also liked how they gave samples of their soup out. Tortas Paquime seemed to have a little bit of everything in their shop and it was very clean as well.
