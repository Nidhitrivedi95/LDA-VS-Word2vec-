64dfRmMmUsOdLnkBOtzp4w I was really excited to try this restaurant after reading the other Yelp reviews. I called to make a reservation and the hostess said they don't take reservations on Saturday nights, but she'll write my name down anyway. When we got to the restaurant, we still had to wait fifteen minutes for a table, so what exactly was the point of writing down our name?? 

We ordered a few vegetarian and tilapia tacos, the tamale wrapped in banana leaf, and chilaquiles verdes. Our server was very attentive, recommended things we would have liked, and continuously checked up on us. The food was really bland and even the hot sauce didn't help with the lack of flavor. My husband also ordered a vegetarian taco with beans and they literally brought him a taco shell with a spoon of beans and a slice of tomato on the side. 

Overall, the only thing I liked at this restaurant was our attentive waiter.
