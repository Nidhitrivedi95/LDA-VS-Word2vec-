5dSrlAsETYORRe4nYmxDZA One of the legit taco places in Toronto. We ordered the chorizo tacos, beef head taco and the brisket taco. All of them were amazing~! they were served with a side of lime guacomole and hot sauce; that's actually hot. Tacos are also served on corn tortilla with cilantro and onions- which made it legit. 

For $2.50 per taco, it's a bit pricy for what it is, but that's the usual going rate for mexican food in Toronto anyways. We aren't in socal or mexico, where it's 50 cents per taco. 

Overall, my gf and I will be coming back here for more. It's on Jane and Lawrence, not really my type of area- but it'll do.
