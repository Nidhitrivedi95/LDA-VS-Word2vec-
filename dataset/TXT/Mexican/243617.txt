thLX_k20SPJ0KyusGTBIHw SO SO GOOD! My best friend and I have been here a couple times and both times have been great! The first time was in October and we sat out on the patio (since the weather was great in AZ, haha) and watched some baseball on the TVs. It was busy, although not too busy. We both had tacos, and let me tell you they were DELICIOUS! The second time was on Cinco de Mayo and it was PACKED! The tacos were still the best part. It was so crowded that we were placed in a tight spot around other large parties. We could barely hear each other and the pitcher margarita LITERALLY tasted like lemonade!!!! WHAT! When a pitcher is about $20 and it is Cinco de Mayo...please actually put some tequila in there. Disappointed about the margs and is why I didn't give a full 5 stars. We will definitely go back though :)
