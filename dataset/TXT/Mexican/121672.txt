h9pEt23IAyjBtUaYA9v46A Stopped by after work for dinner. Delicious!! And fresh! We ordered green chile burrito /wet style "enchilada style". First off it was huge! 6 bucks for it. You can definitely share. Real made from scratch enchilada sauce. The tortilla, green chile. Fresh! My husband is from Michoacan. Loved it. I had the sopes, barbacoa, asada, and adobada. The meat cooked perfect, not salty or runny. Just delicious. My friend had the tacos. Tortillas fresh good meat and flavor. And their salsas are good. And horchsta from a tub not a machine so good. Definitely going back. Price is good for good food.
