Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ This place is right off the casino floor in the Aria.  Let's just start out by saying you are paying for the looks, vibe and location of this place.  It's a nice design, medium loud noise level, great decor.  But at the end of the day you are paying $100 per person or close to it for Mexican food.  Their food is not so cutting edge that it can justify charging what they do.  There are some decent menu items but everything is grossly overpriced from the drinks right on through the menu.  We had the octopus tostadas for appetizer and they were pretty good. Not great.  The main dishes were also good, but basically some prettied up versions of Mexican dishes. 

If you don't care about your expense account, then it's serviceable. If you are forking out your hard earned money, you will be disappointed once you get the bill.
