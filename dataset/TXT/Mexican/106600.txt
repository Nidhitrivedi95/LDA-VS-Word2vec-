 Fine... but the hotel is absolutely awful. Fire alarm went off at 5 am. But not in my room. Good thing it was just smoke from a different floor... but since I was up and hear something faint in the hall way we were able to get out in case it was a major fire. They let someone with a dog next door. Dog barked at paper thin walls for hours... Till like 2 in the am
