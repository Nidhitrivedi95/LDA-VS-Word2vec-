3I7xY7DjWearTz7d4TGdbw I went to Nando's hoping to find a really good Mexican food joint that reminds me of the Mexican food in Texas; not Sonoran style.  The location is pretty good, plenty of parking in and about the shopping center.  The ambiance of the restaurant is family friendly; maybe a bit too much as this place was really LOUD including crying babies.  That was almost enough to make me turn and RUN.  I for one do not like to pay for a meal and cannot converse in a normal tone...who wants to YELL at their dinner companion and pay for the privilege of YELLING.  However really wanting to find that good Mexican food joint, I stayed put.   

First let me tell you they provide really tasty chips and salsa, as well as a pitcher of ice water. I ordered their Chicken Chimichanga which was a HUGE portion.  The overall flavor was OK, refried beans had a bit too much melted cheese on top, the chicken was grilled and tasty, however way to many white onions throughout...some bites were onions only!

So, did I find my really good Mexican food joint?  I'm not sure as of this posting so I will give it another try or two; sure hope the LOUD atmosphere is not the norm and the food reminds me of home in Texas.

Three and Half stars for LOUD atmosphere...
