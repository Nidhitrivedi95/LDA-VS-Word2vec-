Ok9vikKusbG_Ue9pJf6s3Q Was not expecting authentic, exquisitely prepared Mexican food! The Chinatown location threw me off. Excellent attentive wait staff. Cochinia pibil Yucatan pulled pork tacos, better than I had in Cancun! Icy cold corona beer. This place was packed very laid back casual atmosphere.
