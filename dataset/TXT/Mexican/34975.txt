50NTSGbZ3pN5643_K1IReA WoW! Wowie, wow! Food was sooooo good. Tastes authentic, it's rare I can actually say that. Chips & salsa=great.  Chips were thin, warm & fresh. So many tequila choices...OH MY! I had a margarita=$3 good. The pollo funido burrito dinner was so yummy, two can share it. It's delish and a LOT! Tried the beef flautas, they were ok. Beans and rice were done perfectly. Place is yummy and worth the trip and cost. Will venture out again sometime.
