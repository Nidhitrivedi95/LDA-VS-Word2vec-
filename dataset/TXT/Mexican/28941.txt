3WRvQJS9GIBubGxbHMzX2g My wife got sick after eating lunch she threw up three times after lunch there ....Horrible customer service from the Mexican lady that seemed to be in charge there... extremely rude and obnoxious lady with no manners , she was    working on the cashier but she really belongs in the back where she cannot communicate with customers. There were other ladies there that were also Mexican and they were great working the line they were excellent in their service and had a very great attitude , The other lady on the cashier was repulsive .
