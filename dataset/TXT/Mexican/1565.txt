-bMZCfTK7fxFaURynKpBMA Great find on my way to airport.  Outdoor patio is beautiful, service was great, fish tacos and a corona made it a perfect early lunch.  Great homemade chips and salsa to start, with 5 hot sauces in each table to choose from.  Bonus is a friendly cat hanging around the patio.
