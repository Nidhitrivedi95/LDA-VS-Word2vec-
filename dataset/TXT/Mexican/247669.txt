U_jPOTd-Z5KATbTYnDeNxg Great place to grab something for lunch. The small burrito is plenty for lunch and with $7 (tax in) it's a pretty food deal considering its size. The service can be a little slow at lunch when it's busy because they grill everything once it's stuffed in the burrito but this comes with the territory of freshly made fast food.

I'm a big fan, I go once a week probably.
