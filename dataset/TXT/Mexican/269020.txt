wOk2b8zUHWylJOd6FtNsRw First time here since the remodel. I used the drive through and ordered 5 taco's. The woman in the drive through wasn't very friendly. She seemed like she was in a hurry and gave me the feeling that I was an inconvenience. For an empty parking lot and no cars in the drive through, she could have at least faked it for a minute. After I arrived home I was disappointed that my tacos didn't come with any hot sauce. I'm not sure if I was suppose to ask for that separately or if it was left out in error. The tacos were equally disappointing. They had no flavor. The meat tasted like it was from taco bell. Sylvia's should be embarrassed to sell these taco's and consider themselves a Mexican Food restaurant. This probably sounds harsh, but honestly, taco bell has better tacos. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but if you can't get a taco right, you have big problems! In the event that Sylvia's reads this, I would suggest customer service training with your servers. As far as the food, I don't know what to say? Really wanted to like this place... so disappointed!
