_u1Bq7QsgMUXSMex8QHqLQ HANDS DOWN THE BEST BURRITO IN TORONTO. It's difficult and somewhat awkward explaining to someone that your favourite lunch in the world is a fish burrito, but that's exactly the predicament I frequently find myself in. I used to go for the chicken until a colleague wisely guided me toward the halibut. I was apprehensive at first but wow, what an incredible meal. With the halibut your stomach doesn't feel nearly as weighed down as with the chicken or beef. Then there is the construction. A burrito should be built and folded in such a way that you can eat it without getting a single drop on your plate or your hands. If you do, then either it wasn't constructed right or you need to improve your burrito eating skills. Burrito Boyz always builds their burritos right, so if you spill any, it's your fault!
