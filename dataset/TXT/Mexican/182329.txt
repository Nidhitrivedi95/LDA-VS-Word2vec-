NHFsXnwZDkY3ufoTE9iKjQ When you go on your lunch break you expect to be in and out within a good amount of time.  Not the caseWhen I walked in I was in heaven, no line. I ordered, I was pushed off to wait for a cashier. Mind you there was a girl just sweeping, one making herself look busy and the one lady that helped me, who was the only one with amazing cst service. I stood their for a good min, asked why I wasn't being rung up, I was told I still needed to wait on a cashier. In the meantime theirs 2 girls that could've rung me up but chose not to. Then I said will I be helped or not was starred with dead stare smh...I left disappointed and hungry. Never again do I make an appearance where my money is not wanted, because that's exactly how I felt. Thanks but no thanks I didn't eat lunch thanks to the exceptional cs I received!!!!
