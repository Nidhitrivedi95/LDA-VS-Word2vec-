JMwwxARF34aR1aq7hzpiJQ Very nice staff and service. Very low key place. Never had pupusas before so decided to try it. I thought it was more like a flour tortilla. It seems more like a thick corn tortilla which I personally do not care for. We tried the mixed option. They were somewhat tasty but I just did not care for the corn texture. Beans were runny. They were also a bit on the greasy side but that may be how it is supposed to be.
