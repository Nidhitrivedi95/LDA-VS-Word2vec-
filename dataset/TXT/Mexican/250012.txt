UJb1PrUWDFfuzwUPc1pP4Q Just left El Jeff in tempe.  Three of us ready to have a great Sunday.  Upon entering there was no employee in sight.  There were 4 people  seated at the bar.  We sat at a booth for approximately 3 minutes before a young lady appeared who was the bartender.  She made eye contact with me as she walked to the bar.   She proceeded to just talk to people at the bar and drink her bottled water.  A young man came out from the back passed by us twice with no acknowledgement, but was extremely friendly with 2 guys at the bar.  We have been in this industry, combined, for over 30 years.  We wanted to spend $$ at your establishment and would have tipped accordingly.  Very disappointed.
