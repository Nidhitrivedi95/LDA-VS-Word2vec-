Sh_c-UZ8Tk_H1porVieNmA Yum, yum, yum!!! We came here because of Yelp.  The food is excellent.  We started with their Dorados and Guacamole and a Canteen Bloody.  We then shared the fried cauliflower taco, sweet potato Dorados and the Torta with a side of sweet corn.  All of it was very good and I can't believe I'm stating this but the sweet corn was unbelievable.  Yes--- sweet corn was out of this world!!! I think this is my first 5 stars in Yelp.
