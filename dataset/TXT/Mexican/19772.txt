1Yk-GnszDT9g1E1jnD1sIw This used to be one of my favorite spots. Not anymore. Came in today because we were in the neighborhood. Ordered 3 shredded beef tacos, first order came out with flavorless and dry meat. Asked for replacement, still flavorless (not quite as dry), but shell was undercooked. Left disappointed, to say the least.
