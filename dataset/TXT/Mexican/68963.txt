BoTb3FqOsJaFe_koVfyGbw 6 months ago I bought a chicken burrito here and it contained some unknown substance,  I e-mailed the company and they responded quickly. Sent me fee coupons. I went again this week ordered a steak burrito, it contained  grisely meat with no taste. I think it's time to find somewhere else for burritos.
