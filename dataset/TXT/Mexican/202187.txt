PndkxtLCDv69LBE5Ay8Mwg Such great food! The chips and salsa was amazing! I had a Carne asada quesadilla and my boyfriend had Carne asada tacos which were small but they were both delicious! We would definitely get each of our dishes again. The restaurant was small but welcoming. It took a little while for our chips and salsa to get to us but we were really pleased with the overall experience.
