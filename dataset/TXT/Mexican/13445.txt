0jAexNHRHhkQv4zNYqenBA We ate at the Mills St. Tempe Az. location this past weekend. The food & drinks were absolutely amazing!!! Service was superb as well.. Lots of TV's music and a nice big bar. Very open with lots of big windows to people watch! or you can sit in their patio.. This is great casual fun place.  We had the fajitas, and the mole enchiladas. SOOO GOOD!! We will definitely be going back next time we are in Tempe. CAN'T WAIT :-)
