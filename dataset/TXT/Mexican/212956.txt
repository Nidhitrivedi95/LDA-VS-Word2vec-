QUdJyyDDieR_kdrCU9dPFA Great place for authentic Mexican food. Blows chipotle out of the water and I love chipotle. I had the chimichangas and they were so damn good. My girlfriend got hers with fries inside. Great atmosphere. great soda selection. Even greater selection on the fixing to put in your boritos & bowls. I would highly recommend anyone in the area check this place out.
