xkdgCrkgfbI80Htst6-Lbw I agree with everyone else... ridiculously fast service.  Cheap.  The most amazing salsa and freshly made tortilla chips ever (you can get both to go!).  My only complaint is that sometimes when I order tacos they don't bother to ask soft or hard shell, and just give you whatever.  Then I have to awkwardly send it back to get it fixed.
