Rv4aYEKmRsLrijjtq5CS5Q Amazing.   My first time experiencing Ricos Tacos was tonight.   I have never picked up takeout, drove home, ate the food and was compelled to go and buy more.  I did tonight.

First order:
1 - Carne asada taco
1 - Carnitas taco
1- Carnitas vampiros

Second order:
2 Carnitas vampiros

After devouring the first order I could not stop thinking about the vampiros.  I had to go back.  

I have not found better mexican in Henderson
