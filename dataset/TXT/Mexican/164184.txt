lhwIw2i5JNUlUBmWRAYSDg Can't comment on food but one of the staff was not very nice!

On vacation here for the week and found this location on google maps while driving around with my 2 yr daughter this Sunday.  Decided to take a look if this location was open at 9am and pulled up to parking spot close to the front door and left my car running cause my daughter was in car seat.

This location opens at 10am on Sundays and I went back into my running car to try to find another location.  While sitting in my car trying to look for another location on my phone, I see a few of the staff from this location coming to work and one of them approaches my car.  This young white man tells me that I need to move my car and park in another parking lot.  WTF!!!  The lot was empty with only 2 other vehicles parked which were employees and they parked right behind me in another row.

I guess Taco Bell employees are also parking police.  Lol!
