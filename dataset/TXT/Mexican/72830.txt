Cd2ERofxOeCbCi-0yDs0aw We stopped in last night for dinner after reading all of the amazing reviews on Yelp.  The staff is so welcoming and friendly, the space is small, but clean and the food is simply amazing!  I enjoyed a jamaica (hibiscus) drink and the sopapilla with green chile beef and my husband enjoyed the green chile chicken enchiladas with rice and beans...so delicious!  We will definitely be back...and soon!
