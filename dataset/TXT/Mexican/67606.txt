bgx6gYdktqEoQwBdo5lRbA We've been here twice now. Our favorite place closed for some unknown reason so we've been searching for a new Mexican restaurant. The service is top notch. Attentive, polite and gracious. The food is quite tasty. Portion size is generous. This is one of those kind of places where you want to keep coming back. I can't wait to eat there again.
