mB_cI1tCrNxxvr2e2myNrQ Big Taco Bell fan so when we went to Las Vegas the week of my Bday this was a must go to spot! Food was fresh and delicious. Slushy beverage was good but weak. Only complaint is the employees were more concerned about visiting with one another to bother to take my order or get it correct. :-/
