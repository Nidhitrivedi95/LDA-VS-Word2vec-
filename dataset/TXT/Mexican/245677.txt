TRRmgX8mySv_y-DOkTZTFQ This was our 3rd visit here. The food is delicious. Portions are good. The atmosphere is quaint and small, which is good and bad. You may have to wait a while to be seated. 
My wife always orders the fajitas and has not been disappointed. The last, I had Chile Rellenos; one was steak, one was pork. The pork was excellent. It would have made a terrific pulled pork sandwich too. The steak was very good but there were 2 pieces of gristle that I bit into. That was surprising and disappointing. I wanted to add a single tamale to my meal. The waitress said I couldn't do that.
I wish they offered combination meals.
I wish you could mix and match 2 or 3 items to create your own meal. But it's not offered.
All in all, the food is very good. The price is relatively expensive. We will continue to go there. I recommend that you try out this restaurant. I hope you enjoy it too.
