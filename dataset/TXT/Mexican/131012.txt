iBlQvqiy5Rg2h-y9TS1yOA Currently at the restaurant and first of all, there's no hostess.  The group in front of us stated that we had to stop a food server and let them know that we are waiting???  We stopped Fernando and he was gracious and also apologetic.  He assisted in getting us seated.  After being seated, our waitress walked by us several times before taking our order and/or acknowledging our presence.  Approximately 15-20 mins later, Fernando returns with 4 plates of food that we did not order.  Let me say this, the place is beautiful and it was not crowded, so I'm flabbergasted as to why the service was less than ideal and why Fernando had to break his back to accommodate us.  His service was nothing less than amazing, but I felt like he was trying to compensate for the other servers' shortfalls and they weren't busy enough to warrant that.  To the food - The chips tasted old, but the salsa was spicy and tasty.  I ordered Street tacos, which were blah, the wife had a cheese quesadilla which was great, and our boys' nachos were good.  For this to be a brand new establishment, it's shocking to see it being ran this poorly.  I think they have potential, but they may need to overcome their staffing issues first and foremost.  Again, Fernando was great.  The waitress returned and stated that she discounted our check because of the food order error.  The end.
