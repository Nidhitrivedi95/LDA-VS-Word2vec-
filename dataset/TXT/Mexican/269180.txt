woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ Food was good but not worth the price. Had the basic tacos and they were good. Way overpriced though. Two street tacos for $12 is crazy. Beer was affordable. Service was bad. I sat at the bar and took over 10 minutes to get my check. Was not overly packed either. After asking for my check numerous times with no luck, and finally receiving my check, and reminding the bartender to run my card. I was finally able to leave this place.
