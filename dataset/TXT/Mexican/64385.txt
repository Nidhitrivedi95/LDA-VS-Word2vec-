B1xcP1i6-sZR48zjgpwyfg This place is rad. I've only been there once but had been excited about it since it moved in to it's current location. I'm a big fan of the atmosphere. The sort of cheesy Caribbean themed decorations make it seem like a place where you don't have to take things seriously and everyone is there to have fun.

The drinks were very moderately priced although I'm guessing you're not getting the highest end liquor in most of the cocktails (I guess this should be expected from a bar on State Street). they could also use a bigger rum selection. I didn't get a chance to try much of the food but the menu looks great.

One big reason I give this place four stars is because the bartender was super nice and engaging. Sometimes that makes a huge difference with the way a place is perceived and that's definitely the case here. I will be back.
