rbywwnfMjFjJwLQkgpdIEw Gave this place a try since I read a couple reviews and honestly I don't know if I went to the same place. I tried a green chile burrito and my boyfriend had the red and honestly couldn't even eat half. Not sure what the rave was about but we werent impressed. There are definitely other places near by that are better than this.
