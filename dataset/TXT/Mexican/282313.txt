XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg This was just a bad food experience. so disappointed. started the meal with eagerness-after all it's Bobby Flay's  recipes!  BBQ duck cracking on quinoa johnny cakes- first two bites had to try and discreetly discard in my napkins. i've had cracklings- this was pure grissel no chewing this.  next, digging in to tuna nachos- BLAND and chips were served in a small tea cup-what?  next the black bean chicken quesadilla-BLAND!  how can you screw up a quesadilla?  i don't even require spivey but do need flavor. wow!! wine and beer were great. we decided to move to another venue to eat. wow!
