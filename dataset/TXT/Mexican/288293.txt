Yevhl8bTwdJuu_LWKv-4Fw Latin American kitchen w/ a lot to choose from. Cool decor w/ a nice patio. Several different appetizers, entrees, seafood choices sandwiches & tacos. Vegan items are offered as well. Also a nice wine & cocktail menu. We ordered the made to order guacamole, chicken empanadas & guacamole deviled eggs for apps. The apps were good, especially the guacamole. For entrees we all got the braised beef tacos. They were good as well. Decent potion sizes. They were accompanied by frijoles (slightly dry). Over all the place was I recommend, clean & friendly staff. Prices are a bit high. Service was ok.
