NHFsXnwZDkY3ufoTE9iKjQ New location in the McCarran Marketplace. The place is heavily staffed due to the grand opening and everyone is there to make sure your experience is top notch. The interior is nice and modern but very loud and the echoes are quite bad in this space; needs acoustical panels on the ceiling. I consider this somewhat of a fast food option but overall the quality is pretty decent for what it is. They also have Patron margaritas for ~7 dollars should the mood strike you.
