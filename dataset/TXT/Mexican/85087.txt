The Mango Habanero Pacific Mahi Mahi Taco is TO DIE FOR!!!

Rubio's was a featured vendor at one of the Yelp events I attended, and I simply could not get enough of these deeeeeelicious tacos.  (I only hope nobody was paying too close attention to how many times I went back for more...ehem...)

And in addition to the tasty tacos, the staff members were awesome.  Friendly and fun.  Super professional...not one of them shamed me for coming back again and again.  And again.  (And maybe once or twice again.)  Thank you for that. :)

Cannot wait to indulge in some more mango habanero mahi mahi tacos when I get the chance!
