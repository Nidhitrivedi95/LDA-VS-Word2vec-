FxEJjLZj6UdsOCGcgEufeA Was searching yelp for some baked goods while waiting for the hubby at QT and came across this lovely little gem! Prices are crazy cheap! And they sell homemade tortillas! Say whaaaaaat!? Bought a dozen for $2.50! And got an array for pastries all for under $8! I can't believe it! Lol definitely the place to go for dessert and sweet tooth fix on a budget! Can't wait to try the tortillas for dinner tonight! We will be coming back to this shop! Yay! :-)
