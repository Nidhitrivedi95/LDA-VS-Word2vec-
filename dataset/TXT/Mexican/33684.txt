4tiFtmGNFcvKRSPXPVT8Hw It's no wonder this place has such horrible reviews.  Service is lousy, food portions are small, refills don't exist, and the food isn't that great.

We came here tonight with a few friends and would have expected a lot more being that this restaurant is associated with Red Rock Casino.  However, that was not the case.  My Pollo Tacos were not the greatest and the portions were smaller than a damn roach coach and roach coaches offer way better authentic Mexican food.

Food sucks, service sucks, and portions suck.  Why would I come back?
