TxQBdyDktZSk1KVTWh71dw Went to the Friends and Family Event for Babalu's soft opening. Had to wait another 20-30 minutes after our reservation to be seated but the place was jam packed for the event so I wasn't too surprised. Service was a bit slow but everyone was so friendly and it was understandable considering this was their soft opening. Best dishes of the night were definitely the burger, beef empanadas, and the fresh squeezed lemonade! Will definitely be coming back for the great food and low prices!
