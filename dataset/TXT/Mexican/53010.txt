9LAXz_VfATZ0kLdaavkN4g I was indeed slightly manic, feeling triumphant over my sudden decision to visit a restaurant, to which I would usually feel such strong aversion. I felt prepared for the ride. Though I've had a rough time with taco restaurants several times in the past, my last handful of experiences had been quite controlled and delightful, almost disappointingly so. This trend was utterly broken.

Within 10 minutes of entering, something happened. I'm still not quite sure what it was, there was some sort of contradiction or impossibility in my conscious experience.

One early event I recall was feeling like there were bits of vomited meat somewhere in my head, in a place where there should never be a sense of taste.

I reached out for my trusty bucket that I bring with me to restaurants but then I was overcome with the ridiculous belief that I had already thrown up, and was somehow rewinding reality as I reached for my bucket.

From this started my slide into absolute insanity, a complete loss of my sense of reality. 

My memory faded in and out, flashes of salsa, bickering housewives, beer-gulping drunkards, academics, margaritas, and braised meats appeared and disappeared from my vision for what felt like an eternity. How and when I got home I do not remember.
