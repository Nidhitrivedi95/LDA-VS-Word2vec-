zLwFxVeZeHGyId2tG6lBvg the other location on alma school was always so good that i as excited for this location. however, it was disappointing. the food was just okay and the tacos didn't taste like the other location. salsa was still good, though! 

the thing that makes me never want to go back is the disgusting swarm of flies. gross!! all over the screen and outside the building. i understand the location and they have a screen at the ordering window, but that same screen has holes in it and gets opened to take money. so, those flies are in the kitchen where the food is being prepped. obviously flies are natural, but with that big of a problem, i have to believe flies are in/on my food at some point. cant go back.
