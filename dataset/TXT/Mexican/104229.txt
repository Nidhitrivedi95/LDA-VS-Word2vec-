I would say it's slightly better than the average burrito joint in Toronto - largely because of the options available and the cleanliness compared with other places.

It's like any burrito place or Subway - line up and pick your poison as it's put together in front of you.

For about $9 I got a small (10-inch) chicken burrito and a bottle of Pepsi. Toppings included rice, pinto beans, cheese, hot sauce, onion, green pepper, jalapenos and sour cream.

Guacamole is $1 extra, but it's included if you order a mucho XL burrito, which is almost 1.5 pounds and has double the filling of a small burrito, according to the menu.

I went for lunch and the burrito tasted just fine - it really wasn't much better than most I've eaten in this city, but it was filling.

In addition to burritos you can get tacos (1 for $3, 2 for $5.60, 3 for $8), salad bowls, quesadillas, nachos or soup - all meat, veggie or fish. There's also a kids menu.

In terms of main ingredients, your options are beef, chicken, pork, steak, chorizo and tilapia, if it isn't veggie.

I'll likely be back for lunch when I need something quick or if I'm in a pinch.
