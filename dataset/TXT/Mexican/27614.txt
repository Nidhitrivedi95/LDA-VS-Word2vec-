3IwCop28R1_L5jMv6AkL8Q Just moved here from LA, and were looking for a good Mexican restaurant.  After quite a few disappointments, we finally found Jalisco Cantina.  First of all, it's a nice place to eat.  The environment and decor are pleasant, and it's an inviting, attractive, comfortable place.  Definitely not fast-food Mexican.  The chips and salsa were excellent, and the Chicken Chimichangas that I had were excellent, and huge.  The sauce on the seafood enchiladas was not exactly to my wife's taste, but I thought they were good nonetheless.  My overall feeling is that the food is very well prepared, ingredients taste very fresh, and it's definitely worth exploring the menu further.  We'll definitely be going back.
