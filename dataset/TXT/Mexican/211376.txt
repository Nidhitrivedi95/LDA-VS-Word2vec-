qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A Went back for dinner.  Breakfast is the true star at this establishment.  How do you top fresh croissants and guava and goat cheese tarts?!?   But DW Bistro offers some really great grub for dinner too.  The fried chicken is truly amazing, seasoned with jerk spices and fried golden, crispy and just the right amount of greasy.  We had a nightly special dish - red snapper with shrimp.  Crazy good.  We also had the braised short ribs and they were so good too.  So many things to love about this place.  The cherry on top is that the service is always great here.
