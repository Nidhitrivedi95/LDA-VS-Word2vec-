KMxOoHyRKP74PgosuRkkdg I've driven by this place on my way home for a while and finally I was hungry enough to go in. At the end I was full, but not too happy. The chicken and carnitas tacos I ordered were somewhat dry and not too fresh. The decor and food presentation is casual yet elegant and it does feel like a Mexico city joint, but the food didn't stand out. So next time I'm driving by and I get hungry again, I might give them another try. But I wouldn't go out of my way to do that.
