_kzB_xsb9DHUPfXB0XfQGA I've been here a few times. It seems like I go about every 6 months because it takes about that long to forget the prior experience. 

I had the Chimichanga (fried burrito). There is no way that it is better than the Qdoba across the parking lot. It's basically the same thing. But this is true of a lot of Mexican food - it seems like you pay double if it comes with a plate. Someone has to wash a plate. So maybe that makes sense.

3 people - no alcohol - no drinks (water) - no appetizer - 3 entries and the bill including tip was over $50.00. Fast food Mexican without the plate for the same meal would have been less than $20.00.

Maybe it will be better 6 months from now - I'll keep you posted !
