kYvZZ_aKaKLQKeyms74T2Q I've been to this location a long time ago, but today's service was AMAZING! We were a group of 14 and they took care of us so well. Our chips and dips were always filled as well as our drinks! The food came out promptly and was also delicious. I was so impressed with how patient the staff was (my family and family friends are pretty needy lol).This location was awesome and so were the staff! We will definitely be back again!
