pGwfOqNEL8FbMUFspJdAMA Came here with some friends for the $1 tacos special on Monday. Don't be misled, the special only applies to hard shell tacos so if you're not a fan of that, maybe this isn't for you. They also only come in two options, beef or chicken. There was nothing exceptional about either, but I definitely liked the beef one more than the chicken one. In terms of size, the tacos were not smaller just because of the price (as my friend feared). They were reasonable servings and I'd say 3 is good for a meal (unless you're starving). 

The interior is really well-decorated and not something you would expect based on the restaurant exterior. There also wasn't that big of a crowd for the $1 special. Overall, I'm a fan of the $1 deal but not so much for the actual tacos..
