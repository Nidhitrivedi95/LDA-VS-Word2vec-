G6BwYw_0_atLPTzI1uokIA Was very disappointed with this place. We decided to go on a date night which we haven't done in a long time and thought to try this place. We walked in and it wasn't  that busy at all and we had to wait 15 mins to be seated. We ordered our food but we were waiting and waiting for the appetizer (chips and salsa) to come and then our entrees came. Two mins after we were served our entree and appetizer finally came out. The waiter did take that off our bill for the inconvenience which we were grateful. For the price of the food I was very disappointed. I would not go back.
