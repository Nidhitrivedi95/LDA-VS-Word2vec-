qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A So glad this place is in Vegas! I don't know what I would do without it! I eat here literally 2-4 times a week, I get the same thing the Turkey Panini for lunch!!! Seriously i'm addicted to this thing. And even if the food sucked I would still go there because everyone who works there is awesome, especially the owners! GO!
