5O02gK9VpnLZNC-aFnp6lQ Let me start by advising that if you go you must have a Diablo Margarita! It is so good! This is our third time here and my husband is in love with their 7 mares soup! I tried the green shrimp aguachiles today and I was amazed at how fresh and tasty it was! We will for sure keep coming back to this place! Also they have really good tripas tacos! Super crunchy and tasty!
