m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw Weakest attempt at a Mexican restaurant. Chips taste like they come from a package rather than fresh. Top shelf margarita has a flavor like Pinesol smells. Others dishes were ok but nothing worth writing about. Add to that, irs expensive for what you get. I gave It a second star because the service people were nice and friendly. This was our first and last trip to Pancho's.
