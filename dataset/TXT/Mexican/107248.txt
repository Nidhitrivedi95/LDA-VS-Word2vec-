fqMAnoS2sTokz6lqBSmoCw Go there for drinks and the atmosphere - not the food! Although I'm hoping they switch it up and change my opinion as they fine tune the menu since it's brand new...Here is a quick recap - ceviche is so salty and barely any white fish...go to Soul Gastrolounge if this is what you want. Tacos are bland, except for the Pork Pastor, and the baja fish was ok. The shrimp taco...where was the shrimp, I ask? Must still be in the ocean...because it wasn't in the taco. And then they rave about the sauce bar - of the 6 sauces, 4 tasted like chipotle and the other two; cilantro cream was OK and the mild salsa (I think that was the harvest salsa?) I would describe as "trash juice" while my friend went with "dirty dish water"...so take you're pick. All in all, great place for drinks and socializing before you go elsewhere for dinner. I'm hoping this changes! Maybe new restaurants should provide customer feedback forms as they figure things out - just a thought!
