42TGx8KatGNPCi7rwOzazg Love, love, love this place. It's our favorite place for date night. Excellent service, authentic dishes, generous portions, reasonable prices. And, I love that it's minutes from my home. Excited that they are resuming live music on the weekends.

Subtracting 2 stars because I think it is absolutely ridiculous that you cannot make a reservation unless you have a party that is bigger than eight people. Seriously? How often are you going to get a party bigger than eight? I think this is stupid. So they just don't care about the people who were wanting to go out on a date night or maybe a family dinner night with A party of 2 to 5 people.
