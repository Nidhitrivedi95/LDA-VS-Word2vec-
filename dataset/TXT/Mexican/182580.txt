nIwtGMkMyx0elLxVFs1D6A Decided to try this place. It is very convenient since its close to the metro station. It is a small restaurant but had plenty of room and some patio space when we went. The service was very good, and the food came out pretty fast. It wasn't the best Mexican food that I have ever had, but for Canada, it is not bad at all. I think it was pretty good overall. Dessert was very good. As we were leaving, live music was just getting started. 

I would definitely go back to this place, as I have had a hard time finding decent or real Mexican food in Toronto. The prices are good and the service is great! I love the area, as it is walkable and has a cool vibe to it. Give it a try if you are in the area!
