C2BR0TjNacoNzItPLUHTAA Fish tacos were just alright. I had high hopes after reading the previous reviews. My fish was over cooked. The corn tortillas were grilled, but to a (hard) crisp. I guess I prefer a soft corn tortilla that folds easily and a fresher taste than having my fish covered in a mayonnaise-heavy-slaw. Not for me... 

But, on the positive: GREAT service, immaculately clean atmosphere, and a nice little beer selection!
