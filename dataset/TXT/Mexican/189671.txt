oCwJdiYhZS8VM5_LgmQP0g Hard to find decent Mexican on Sunday's in far SE Valley without driving a bit. Been here several times. Kids eat free on Sunday's but it's a little gimmicky. Good flavor though especially if you like the New Mexican style. Service is decent but sometimes there's a wait to be seated. Wish the staff acted more like they wanted to be there. Place is starting to feel more dirty/rundown every time I come. I think it's the weird indoor waterfall humidity. Chips and Salsa is great. But I always leave feeling like I ate a brick. Food was a little runny/thin this time. Have to be back. Not much else around.
