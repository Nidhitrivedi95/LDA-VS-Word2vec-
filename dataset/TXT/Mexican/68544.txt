bMSiHjs2fbKbBNPyuTwhHA The views from the restaurant are really amazing. The location also can't be beat. The food, however, does not match the views. The tacos are small, but worse than being small, most of the food was bland - guacamole, bol, tacos, etc.. Don't be afraid to add some serious flavor. If the portions are going to be little, the flavor has to be big. 

On a side note. They may want to reconsider how they serve their tacos. Serving them family style is odd. The display is far more odd. It looks like a child placed a soft taco shell on a tin lid and then tossed on some toppings. There is nothing pretty about the display. Please consider a better way to do this.
