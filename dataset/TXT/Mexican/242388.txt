TEaBolNAkOdRm2gvIYz4OQ Went to Ponchos while in town on vacation upon the reviews of locals who recommended it.  
 First, the setting.  The place seems to be somebody's old house, with 5 or 6 small rooms (bedrooms maybe?) off from one hallway.  Luckily, we were seated in what was probably the living room at one time.  The largest room in the place.  It really reminded me of Thanksgiving at my Aunts place when I was a kid.  Too many people in a dinky house.
  Service was OK, we were greeted, drink orders taken, and a basket of chips with sauce brought.  Our server returned within probably 5 minutes to take our order.  Not overly friendly, strictly business.
 I ordered the chicken chimi with red sauce, the wife ordered the same with green sauce.  Found out later the green sauce was loaded with onions (possibly the reason i had to make a bee line back to Walgreens for Immodium after arriving back at our condo). Both dinners came loaded with beans, rice, guacamole, sour cream, lettuce and tomato. A ton of food, which we both finished half, and left with to go boxes.  The Chimi did leave me wondering if they make them wrong back in Michigan, as it was not deep fried and crispy. Back home, what I had is called a wet burrito.  Any who...the thing was LOADED with shredded chicken, and pretty tasty.  
 I have always looked forward to trying authentic Mexican food in the Southwest, and was a bit disappointed that it wasn't  a "wow" thing.  Have had better back in Grand Rapids. Not that it was bad, just not up to the hype.  And yeah, Bill Clinton ate there 15 years ago.
 Have always looked for an opportunity to say this on the web. Meh.
