zdE82PiD6wquvjYLyhOJNA Linda @ KoMex Fusion was awesome. She was very friendly and helpful both times my wife and I have taken our Fusion to go. The food was excellent. On our first visit we had the fusion wings, bulgogi beef , the fettuccine and a fusion tostada. Our hats are off to KoMex. The wings were spicy but not too spicy, the beef was tasty and it was a hefty portion, the fettuccine was perfectly al-dente and the tostada was fusion of the two cultures(Mexican and Korean) at its best. Linda also politely cautioned us about purchasing the kimchi fried rice, as many westerners such as ourselves, may not enjoy it if they have not tried kimchi before, which was very kind given that it was our first time in the restaurant and she didn't know we love kimchi. Our second experience was just as good as our first, but this time we tried the fusion nachos, the pan fried fish, and the combination bulgogi with stir fried veggies. The fusion nachos were fantastic and there were a lot of them, the pan fried/grilled fish was done perfectly and the bulgogi was a home run just like the first time but with more meat and veggies. I will keep coming back to KoMex fusion because the food is great, the service is great, its conveniently located and the price is right. Great Job KoMex.
