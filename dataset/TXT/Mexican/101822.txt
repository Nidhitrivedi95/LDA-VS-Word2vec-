EvDUi_H6-JG3QfGWiInAlw Kind of between a 2 and 3 we ordered the prime rib special. Nothing special about it. One went back as it was overcooked. Mine was tough. The only good thing really was the dessert. They are huge!  Service was fast and that was why we went there. The other restaurants at the casino had at least an hour wait. Drinks not refilled and it really wasn't that busy. No dinner in the future if I go back. Just breakfast.
