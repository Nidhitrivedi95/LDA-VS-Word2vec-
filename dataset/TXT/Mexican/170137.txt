lYsq47uDzdjYUGtyUq8aaQ Oh my my my! This place is great! Everything everyone ordered was amazing! So much flavor! I fell in love with Mexican street corn and the spinach! I ordered the shrimp diablo! Delicious! The sangria was out of this world... Just needs more fruit.. But still great! My bf had the special, which was a huge rib eye! The sauce that sat under the steak was amazing! I can't eat much beef, but id be willing to deal with the tummy ache for that piece of meat! It was so good! We will def be back!
