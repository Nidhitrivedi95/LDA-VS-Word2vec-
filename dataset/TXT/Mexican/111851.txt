g384tK63QxXXm3UNhtGMuA This a great place!!! Went in for dinner after our conference at the convention center. Service was great, you order and then grab a seat. I ordered two tacos, the Pork Belly (which was very tasty) and the Green Butcher (okay but not as good as the Pork Belly Taco). The meat was tender and very full, I recommend getting 2 tacos. There is a salsa bar, not a lot of seating indoors, mostly outside on the street. Great for dinner, great food, nice decor and great service! Wholeheartedly recommend!!!
