JsCKeWHA8n_5mFQ3F6t4UA GYG satisfied my mexican craving and then some while in Vegas.  I have been planning to visit while on the East Coast and never got around to it. Happy Hour in Vegas presented the perfect opportunity. 

Located in New York New York ofcourse is GYG. This restaurant features a street side bar equipped with all your tequila fantasies. 1800, Avion...Patron (all my bffs). They advertised the Buy 1Get1Free deal Margaritas 2 for $9. My friend and I were famished and we're craving nachos. The Happy Hour menu featured $6 appetizers including tostadas, tacquitos, nachos. We paired beef nachos with the overly addicting Honey Chipotle Wings. 

The fresh flavor here is definitely unmatched anywhere else. For simple appetizers these dishes were magically delicious.  The nachos featured fresh cilantro,  tomatos, Seasoned beef and were perfect. The WINGS!!!!! Crisp, succulent, spiiiiiicy,  honey dripping glazed TO PERFECTION.  My Margarita paired well with my menu items and left me light as a feather.   

The service here was professional and speedy. I love this location.  GYG represents NY so well. Perfectly placed in the Village of the hotel replica of NYC. Easily my favorite Hotel on the strip.  I later learned GYG turns into a little lounge after hours.
