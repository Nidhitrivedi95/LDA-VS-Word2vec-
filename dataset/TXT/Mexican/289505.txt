YkOCo5ipV2he2WXIAlZb-A The long awaited and anticipated visit to the Jaburittos!! I was first introduced to the concept of this kind of sushi when a friend of mine brought me to a place called Soho burrito! I'm wondering if they are affiliated or competitors? Anyways I live super close to this location so I can only imagine this one being my regular go-to for the whole concoction of sushi and burritos! They have pretty similar things as the other place and with this being my first time to the location I wanted to test the staff's knowledge on their menu just to see how much they could tell me. I did plenty research and actually knew what I wanted before ordering however another recommendation could always help sway you to a different item! I love spicy and I also love fish! With THAT being said I went for "the Redondo"! So good! The spicy wasabi mayo sauce is sooo good I even asked for a little extra! I can't wait to go back and try some more! There's about 4 more that I need to get checked off my list and by that time I should even be "a regular"!
