_XN-GwzZwAyIqLKJsl2htg I have been wanting to try this place for a while. I have a 2 year old, so it's hard to eat at a nice restaurant. I ordered pad Thai take out. I've seen pictures in ads of what the pad Thai looks like, but what I picked up looked nothing like the picture! In fact my pad Thai had no jalapeños or any peanuts! It had an overwhelming lime flavor. I thought maybe it would be a little spicy, but not at all. I'm pretty disappointed. It looked like a cool restaurant otherwise, but probably won't come back.
