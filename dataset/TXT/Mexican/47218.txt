7vXmhdqO6aAoZGEVyusk0w Pretty tasty breakfast burritos. Got the chorizo and eggs and the bacon n eggs fresh n great flavor! Great selection of salsa my fav is the spicy red one ...small hole in the hole but with trying. Friendly guys upfront and quick service. Only downfall its hot ass $#*+ in there lol no AC in this vegas weather ia a no go for me! Take ur food home n enjoy it in the AC ...BUT overall good fresh fast food
