XaUiroJrP634SIx8O8xk9Q First off this place is really good! I had three tacos and my husband had three tacos. Mine were chicken, shredded beef and pork. All the meat was good but my favorite was the chicken for sure. My husband had 2 steak and 1 chicken and his favorite was the chicken as well. 
The reason for the 2 star review is because the girl at the start of the line was not very nice and seemed annoyed when we asked her questions. Then while we were going through the line where you add the toppings to your meal the girl who put our toppings on was choosing to use her hands to scoop out ingredients instead of using the utensils provided. THIS SUPER GROSSED US OUT!! I was also worried about the people who have food allergies and the cross contamination aspect. She was in a hurry and seemed annoyed too which didn't help... we also got charged wrong but didn't notice until after we were done with our meal....
But like I said the food was really good. We purchased margaritas from the bar (prickly pear and a regular) and they were great!
