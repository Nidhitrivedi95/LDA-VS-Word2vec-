As others have mentioned the decor is not necessarily hip, nor is the grand dining area particularly cozy, but I still liked the atmosphere. 

Affirming its authentic barrio status, when the waitress approached my nonwhite but also non-Hispanic self, she greeted us with "Buenos tardes. Como estan?" Having just returned from vacation in Argentina where I grew accustomed to these greetings despite my inability to speak Spanish, I quickly responded, "Buenos tardes, bien gracias." In Buenos Aires I was quickly identified by most waiters as a tourist so the conversation would then continue in English. Back here in my own hometown of Phoenix it's a slightly different story. Confusion reigned after I got out my Spanish response. She asked me something. I looked at her puzzled and instead of saying simply, "I don't speak Spanish" I reflexively said, "Como?" which of course extended the linguistic chaos at our table, because she then repeated herself and naturally I repeated my look of confusion. She probably wanted to smack me by the time we figured out what was going on. She was gracious though. 

The food was superb. I ordered something I'd never tried before: machaca con huevos. My mouth waters at the very thought of it. For the unacquainted, machaca is basically shredded beef. It was mixed up with egg, onions, tomatoes, and peppers, and came with a side of beans and rice. My friend had a more standard plate of cheese enchiladas and a tostada, and she also gave it the thumbs up.

The service was quick and friendly. The atmosphere, though criticized elsewhere for its decor, was actually pretty interesting to me mainly because of my fellow customers. There were some large families there, from all walks of life. 

I'm definitely going back, especially since I live close by.
