iSmQkgaSE36nzctelDq-cg I was in the area so I stopped here. The place was very clean. I asked for their specials and they had mini pupusas for $1 each with a minimum order of 10.  I believe their only choice is revueltas but that didn't matter to me as they are my preference. I ordered them to go. I really liked them but the only thing that I would change is the cheese, it was very chewy.  That didn't stop me from tearing these up. The sauce that came with this complimented the taste. I would come back here again and try other plates.
