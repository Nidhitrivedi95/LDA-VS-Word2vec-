vCcnawY4Q41A1rlnxKBzkA Went there today.  Quite possibly the worst service and worst Mexican food I have had in my living in the Phoenix area for 25 years.  The two cooks were extremely rude.  I had to repeat myself around 4 times for every little thing I wanted.  The cooks kept barking at me in Spanish, and would not listen to me when I would clearly ask for something as simple as a large Dr. Pepper.  I have not met anyone that rude at a Mexican food place since I ate at Burrito Express at Alma & Elliot.  The beef was terrible, low quality, salty gristle.  It is the saltiest Mexican food I've ever had.  I also ordered some enchiladas to go, and they didn't even cook them.  They just threw some cheese in a small tortilla and poured some sauce on it.  I am quite literally never ever going to go back there, and I would not suggest eating there.  Mucho Taco at Ray & Alma is easily ten times better.  They actually cook their food over there and put a lot of effort into the ingredients and have real recipes.  So far I haven't found anything as good as Mucho Taco.  They've literally got the best enchiladas I've had anywhere.  They are also inexpensive.  Their service is rude at times, but the food is excellent.  As far as Taqueria Mi Casita, everything about that place sucks.  I will never ever go back.  I can handle rude service, but not rude service combined with low quality meat that are piles of trimmed fat posing as steak.  There is quite literally no reason to go back to Taqueria when Mucho Taco is just a short drive up the street about a mile away.
