w95B_YptshIE_y68NTyylQ Went through the drive thru recently and ordered what I usually order. Everything tasted normal, but I got a pretty severe stomachache later. The only thing I can say is that while I won't quit Taco Bell as a whole, I won't be going as often. I think that sometimes they don't thoroughly cook the potatoes and meat.
