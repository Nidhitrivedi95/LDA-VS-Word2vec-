9jdlzH0HjU9_Fi3D-_a6gA I am not the hugest fan of Serrano's because their food is hit and miss most of the time.  Sometimes I will have a great meal there and other times I won't.  Why do I keep going there, you ask?  Well it's my grandma's absolute favorite place, so I go to keep her happy.

They do have lovely margs though.  They're strong and tasty.  The chips and salsa are great, and they make a mean cheese crisp.  How could you screw that up though?!

I really love Spanish rice and theirs is just okay, but their enchiladas are good, as well as their chile relleno.  If you're looking for a new Mexican food spot to try out, check out Serrano's- hopefully you hit them on a good night!
