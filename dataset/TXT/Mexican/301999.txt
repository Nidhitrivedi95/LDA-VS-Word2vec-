zWKpPyzm0W9N5OEPDuwgMA OMG it's so good!. Ate there today for lunch for the second time since they've opened and the portions are definitely smaller then Chipotle's but the food is fabulous and so much better than Chipotles. It's a little pricey as you dont get that much food for what they are charging but the food is crazy good. When they first opened, I waited a while to get my food but today it was much quicker with what looked like the same amount of people in line, which I guess is normal since all the employees got more familiar with the menu. I always get the pastor torta which I think has the best value. If you are going to get taco's get two or three. One simply won't fill you up and combo things to get more for your buck!
