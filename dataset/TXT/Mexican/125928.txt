hTSIT3puu8m8-kOZYS4Zdg Needs a lot of work.  To expensive for what you get.  I prefer chipotle to this place which is unfortunate because I want to support local.  They need a brown rice option and a burrito bowl and a drink should not be over 9 dollars!  The flavors were ok.. Not my favorite ohio city eatery
