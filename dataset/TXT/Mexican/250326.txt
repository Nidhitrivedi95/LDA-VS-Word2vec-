UJb1PrUWDFfuzwUPc1pP4Q Twas a tight place. We came here on a Saturday 1/14/2017 and anticipated a lot more people to show up, but it rained so maybe that's why the turnout was smaller than expected. 

There were dancers I guess, but as soon as we showed up around 9 PM, they were leaving, which I thought was odd. 

We ordered Long Island Iced Tea's. They were good.

Right around that time, people started to line up outside, but again, no dancers and a DJ. Weird. Maybe management didn't anticipate high turnout on a rain day? By then, we left.

Since I didn't stay the full duration til 2 AM, I'm hopeful to try them out a second time. From what I hear, El Hefe has some good tacos. Can't wait to try these, and if the pork al pastor is really, truly "al pastor", which I haven't seen in all of Arizona yet, then I'm all in.
