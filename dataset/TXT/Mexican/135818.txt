INzLc1Y0JNQzIHjPH2Nbeg We went to Fuzzy's for lunch yesterday and  based upon my first experience I am not a fan.  I actually would return to drink beer or try a margarita before I would go back for the food.  The starter was chips and guacamole...not sure why they need to sprinkle chips with anything just make good fresh chips however guacamole was okay.  I tried ground beef nachos and they were meh.  I had migas which were okay but my fish taco was crunchy with hardly any fish.  Lastly, what is up with being given the light/buzzer and then I have to go to the kitchen window for my food where multiple orders are up and I have to ask which tray/order is mine? A worker brought our chips and guac so why not ditch the nasty light/buzzers and just call out order number or bring out the food.
