jzM4dTlstNmGDPRT9SC6Hw Very overpriced for the type of food they serve.  Staff was not friendly, waiter spoke minimal English, not your typical Mexican Restaurant.  Would not make a crispy taco shell, soup served with a teaspoon and flies galore due to large open bar with no air blower.   Surprised to see the Boss in an adjacent dining room doing paper work.  He would of benefited from asking customers for feedback.  I give it six months.
