7Q2cYSl5NBYytJzgjX0oKw The drinks are pretty good. But the service and food is mediocre. Our server never brought napkins or silverware to our table and only brought drinks after asking a third time after almost an hour here. The food then had no flavor and was nothing above . Overall,  if you're looking for a tuesday night out,  i would choose somewhere else.
