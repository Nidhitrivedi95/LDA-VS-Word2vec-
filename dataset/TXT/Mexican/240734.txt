Tc1ly-0VLk3AaoMb7CrlVA Actually came here with a friend for a late night dinner. We went out to the bars that night and this was one of the only open options. After 1am they only serve in the drive through. They were nice enough to serve us at the walk up window. They give you a lot of food for your money and its great drunk food. I also like that the tortilla is made fresh too.
