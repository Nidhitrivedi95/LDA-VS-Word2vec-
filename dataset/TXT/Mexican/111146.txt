fzQeUR_AvjpwIWjsMDAbGw This place is terrible. The few times that I've gone here I've had to leave before ordering because they're too busy in the back to even acknowledge that I'm there. Today I ordered a small bean and cheese burrito as the only customer in the place. I then waited forever while the two people after me got their burritos first. One customer had to ask for the drink he had already purchased.  A delivery guy came to pick up an order that wasn't ready and then they proceeded to screw that order up. The employees didn't have any care in the world to even be friendly but chatted about their drunk friend. Thanks for wasting 90% of my lunch break, I won't be coming back.
