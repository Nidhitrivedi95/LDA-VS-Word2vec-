YaTlfyPieOXwHH16wzieFg Cafe Rio is amazing, but not this location. For over a year now, either the drink machines have been broken, or staff is too lazy to refill them. (I'm inclined to go with the latter.) 

On our last visit, we ordered a steak quesadilla. Three ingredients. I'll let you take a guess at which one was missing. While they remade the quesadilla, this is just what's expected from this location. Long wait times, indifferent staff, half of what they advertise that makes them unique unavailable.
