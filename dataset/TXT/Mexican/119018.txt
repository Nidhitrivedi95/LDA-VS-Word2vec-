GrwvBAEALujIOPQeOfN1vA Just finished a great meal with the family tonight, what I really want to tell about is the last time we came here. We were starving for Great Mexican food and we had just been taken to our table, unfortunately our son had wasn't feeling so hot... As soon as we got seated he tossed up everywhere! Feeling frustrated as we were all hungry I took the dude outside, to my surprise Josh had come out with a glass of ice water for him! Talk about service and going the extra mile! Thank you bud, we appreciate it and although the food is good that kind of service will keep us coming back.
