pEH8XwiyGOe1t7GlboAgGw My husband took me here for my birthday dinner on Monday night and although I was already really excited to try it based on the menu and other reviews I'd read, I loved it even more than I expected. The service was fantastic and the food was incredible - you have to try the Rajas Poblanas! Andreas, the owner, came out to check on us and make sure we were happy with everything and then sent out a plate of all of their scratch made cookies for us to try with our dessert. All in all I was super impressed with this place and all the care they put into ensuring our experience was great. We didn't even mention it was my birthday to anyone at the restaurant, so none of this was special attention, just their usual attention to detail it seems. We will absolutely be back!
