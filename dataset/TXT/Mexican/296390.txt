zCmwErM82hdKl4L2UixDJw Recently moved to the Lakewood/Cleveland area from Columbus. A co-worker referred me to Barrio. Everything Ive ever had here is so tasty. I am a sucker for blood orange and their blood orange margaritas are top notch. The variety of tacos are unreal. Chips, salsa, guac oh my...all so good. Finally, recently had friends from Columbus up here visiting, decided to do a late lunch here on a saturday afternoon. All 3 ladies said they wished there was a taco place like this in Columbus!
