Yevhl8bTwdJuu_LWKv-4Fw Definitely one of our favorite restaurants.  This is one of our regular haunts, so we've had many of the many of the menu items.   All have been delicious.  My wife loves the Ropa Vieja with a side of plantains.  I'd say their Blackened Tilapia Tacos are the best fish tacos of anywhere I've eaten because the fish is grilled, not breaded & fried like everywhere else.  We love the variety of guac's they have ... and we love the mix of chips.  Portions are generous.  

We've eaten on the patio, inside in each of the "rooms", and at the bar.  The service has always been attentive without being overbearing.  

Over the years we have taken several friends, co-workers, and relatives to Paladar, and they have all loved the food and come back.  Always a good idea to make a reservation, especially for dinner on Friday and Saturday nights when they are busiest.  

Only drawback has been the parking at Eton which isn't under Paladar's control.  Sometimes it's hard to find a spot.
