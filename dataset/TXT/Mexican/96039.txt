Eis_z-uF_2gUf83UE9blog I think the food at Cafe Rio has potential, but the service at this location is bad...most of the time. The wait is excessively long and they seem to always be out of queso dip. Most of the crew looks to be more into fun than work. I have never seen a manager here, or at least seen anyone that resembles a manager here. The hardest working people are the ladies making the tortillas.
I am not happy with the amount of meat that they give. They seem to do the same thing that Chipotle does, where they scoop or grab a bunch of meat and then scoop or grab some of it right off of your burrito. Somethimes they forget to do that grab the meat off your burrito thing and that makes me happy. Otherwise it is pretty much a not good experience from the beginning ( the excessively long line) to the end (trying to find a clean table and being disappointed in your rice overload burrito).

This location needs some customer service training. 

Enjoy, the location on Eastern.
