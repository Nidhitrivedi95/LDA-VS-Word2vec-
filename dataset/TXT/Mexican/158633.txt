Ks9nrEuLdjmrLH9uXz_G8A I used to work for Chipotle a couple years ago and it was the most miserable job I had ever had. I worked there for two and a half years in a company that demanded robots. This location is different. There is one girl that works at the register who seems to actually care about her job. She told me how things have changed over the years. This Chipotle is probably one of the better ones. They know how to take care of their customers.
