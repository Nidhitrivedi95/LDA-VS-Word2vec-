O3y-5O1n5l0ge_6KGyR_4A Im going to have to agree with Chuck here.  Faustos is as authentic as you can get.  Usually get the taco salad or chimichangas!  Everything is fresh and made fresh.  The prices are cheap for the amount of food you get.  I've gotten all my friends to try this place, and no one has had a bad experience yet.  Highly recommend this place to anyone craving some really good mexican.
