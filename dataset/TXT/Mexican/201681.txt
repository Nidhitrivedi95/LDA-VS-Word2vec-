plHKBwA18aWeP-TG8DC96Q Here's the deal:

(1) The wait can be a bit long. Call ahead. The wait for food can be long too.

(2) They aren't really tacos. It's basically awesome meat wrap in a flour tortilla.

(3) The music is too loud.

(4) The mac and cheese is flavorful but nothing special. Definitely not worth $7.50
