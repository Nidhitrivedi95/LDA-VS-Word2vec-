xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw After a lifetime of California 'fair food' masquerading as fry-bread, this was a delight!
Light and fluffy. Fresh and hot and not at all greasy. We all loved it, including a 13 year old and somewhat picky 9 year old. All of the following can be recommended:

- Ultimate taco with red chile beef
- Spicy pisole
- Bean and cheese fry bread
- the cheese covered fry bread

The physical restaurant is sub-par, but a sign said they will be moving soon.
