o6Yor6ofIw2TqM3mN28Kzg Crazy busy when I went (around 7pm on a tuesday). Had to stand around and wait for a while before a table freed up. Had a pork soft taco, a chorizo soft taco, and a squash pupusa. Not bad at all, but nothing to write home about. The meat in both tacos was a little dry. The salsa was good though. Drenched them in that. I think my expectations were maybe higher than they should have been given the crowds. Friendly service, although they never brought the beer we ordered. Nice and cheap. If I go again I'll definitely be trying a burrito. They looked a bit better than what I ordered. Not too big but mostly full of meat. Anyway. A-OK. In order from worst to best: Street Taco in San Francisco - this place - La Taqueria in Vancouver - basically anywhere in Mexico or Central America. Just in case that helps.
