RueofL7ciWr_DfgOHk5XpA The place was super clean, the employees were happy! Service was quick and the food was good, better than the one over on Octillio or Ellsworth or somewere, where it was all beans not matter what you ordered.
I like this place, may by they cleaned up their act since all those reviews.
