XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg My family and I were on the hunt for a fun, semi-upscale place to have dinner when we came across the Mesa Grill. It was a happy find!

I had a delicious Rib Eye cooked to absolute perfection. To the second it could not have been better. Everyone else enjoyed their meals as well. Great appetizers and entrees and no room for dessert!

I'll be back some day!
