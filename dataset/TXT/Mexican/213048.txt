qUqmTlchliF55jF7s4Xlmw I've always love a good bowl from chipotle, but this particular chipotle just didn't quite cut it. Of course you're always going to have different experiences anywhere you go, but the meat here was super dry, looks like it's been sitting in the bucket for hours. I actually came here twice back to back, still looked like it did the other day. The lady serving me looked annoyed taking my order and when I finally went to ring up my order, another lady from the kitchen came around to the front standing next to me, practically shouting and digging through the "tip" jar commenting where the rest of the tips are at. And of course took the tip money with her and left. This happened on both days I was here, not joking.
