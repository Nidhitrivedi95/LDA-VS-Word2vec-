RRtjC-KUE9vSbD09r6is2A Decent happy hour with good drink and food prices. I always notice the restaurants that give you only good prices on food or only good prices on drinks, which is understandable but come on, just discount a few popular apps to go with those drink specials! Anyway, my favorite thing here isn't even the Happy Hour, though, it's brunch. The French toast with the agave maple syrup is sweet, heavenly perfection, and the pancakes are awesome too, especially the pineapple or coconut. The Potbelly burrito is definitely big enough to split, and goes nicely with a bloody Maria or two!
