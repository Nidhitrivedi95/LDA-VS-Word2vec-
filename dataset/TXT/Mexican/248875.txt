uCDVOidGLpD-Q7_y82nx2g I've been here a few times and give it resounding "pretty good" over all. 

The food I've had has been more or less tasty each time but the service isn't fantastic. The price to portion ratio is a bit on the small side for some dishes but the platter of assorted tacos for 2 that hovers around the $20 mark is a decent value and a great datenight option. 

All in all a good option when I want something better than nachos and don't want to get too far from home.
