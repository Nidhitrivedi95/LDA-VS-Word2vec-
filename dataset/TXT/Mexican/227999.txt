S599hCA4kJJO3_b6SRFKoA Review for Sunday Brunch!

Not to be confused with Lindo Michoacan, this Michoacan is located next to Red Robin and across the street from Sushi Loca in the far North West.  Jade hosted a UYE for Sunday Brunch and this place was packed!

Sunday Brunch is from 10am-3pm.  What a deal!  It's buffet style, a short buffet but my favorite part is the all you can drink house margaritas and champaign mimosas!  I had three plates of fajitas and tons of guacamole since I love avocado but where I killed it was the margaritas!  

The server we had was awesome, he was busy as hell so I had to flag down others to help feed me my alcohol.  And how we got a big party is beyond me but the live mariachi was awesome.  They even sang to a birthday girl in our party.  

Flavored house margaritas usually run for $5.00 each and the food combined would have cost a lot more than the $14 Sunday Brunch cost.  So this was a killer deal, the foods tasted authentic meaning it doesn't have that added fake flare to it, the tortilla machine was spinning and they were coming out fresh to the buffet line.  

$14 Sunday Brunch for all you can drink (and eat too I guess) is not bad at alllll.
