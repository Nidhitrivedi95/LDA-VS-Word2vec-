1pm04v3jhOCDJjSMWiZSTQ With a name like Pineapple Grill, I just had to come in and try this place. I'm happy that I did. We ordered a burger and a Philly cheese steak sandwich and both of them were fantastic. They cook them right as you ordered so the food is hot and fresh and made the way you like it. The burger was one of the best that I've ever had and the Philly cheese steak sandwich was amazing. It beat out places that specialize in that kind of sandwich. The staff here is really friendly and you can even watch your food being cooked behind the counter. The place is really clean too, so you don't have to feel uneasy about the food being clean.
 It looks really nice inside, there's a waterfall feature beside the door that's really fun to watch. We will be back to try other stuff on the menu.
