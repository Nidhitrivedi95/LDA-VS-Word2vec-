2aiaryk7kgUBhXhVu-9vHg We never visit Edinburgh and miss out on coming to this perfect little place. The Nachos beat us every time-NEVER have a plate each!! The food is warming, authentic, simple and cheap and there's always loads of it. It's a tiny space-but this just adds to the atmosphere. Staff are friendly and keen to help you choose from the brilliant menu. This is a lovely place to roll our of warmed up, well fed and dosed up with Tequilla in a cold Edinburgh night. Perfect!
