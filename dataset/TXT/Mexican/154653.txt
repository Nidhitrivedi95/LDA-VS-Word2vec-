K-uQkfSUTwu5LIwPB4b_vg Overall this was very nice...ambience and decor was trendy and fit very well with local flavor/culture

Price range...4$$$$, as this place is expensive

Presentation...5 stars...plates food and seating are superb

Portion...small portions...eat something before you go here

Guacamole made tableside is good...asked for more...never got it...maybe it is rationed..
