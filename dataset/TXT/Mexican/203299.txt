pomGBqfbxcqPv14c3XH-ZQ We LOVED Cantina Laredo before it became Leticia's so we were hoping for the same wonderful Mexican food.  It started out quite well with tasty salsa and bean dip but the goodness ended there.  My husband and I ordered the chicken fajitas.  Ugh!!! Worst fajitas ever!!  They arrived on the usual black grill plate only they weren't steaming....lukewarm at best in a soupy juice of zucchini and tiny little bits of "cooked chicken" not even grilled.  It reminded me of the chicken you get in chow mein.  There was absolutely no Mexican flavor.  We were so disappointed and will not be returning.
