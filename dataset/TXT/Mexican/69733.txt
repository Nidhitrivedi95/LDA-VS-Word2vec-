bsGVvCtj8i2xGl15XX8Dxw I consider myself something of a burrito expert now; and so in my expert opinion, this is not for you if you've been to :Burrito boys, Burrito bandidos, Chipotle.

I am CERTAIN I ordered hot salsa which didn't turn out to be all that hot - I wonder now if having mild salsa along with the hot one, cancelled the whole hotness for me.

I have to say that this is the first place who gave me my burrito 5 minutes after ordering -which impressed me until I opened the foil and realized that my burrito is all mushy and not toasty. I realized today, that the toasted-ness was essential because it gives it shape and helps you hold on to your bundle. 

The burrito is plain - except for the overwhelming sour cream you taste - which is not cool. Even under best circumstances, sour cream + any sort of rice - is not cool , even though I love each of them equally.

The good thing is that it IS filling without the awful side affects of itis. he tortilla is so big (or maybe they don't put enough ingredients?) that there is no chance of burrito bursting, which is a common phenomena for burritos from the above mentioned places...which also eliminated the need for lengthy toasting.

I found the "Rip into bag in case of emergency" also amusing because the bag is a open paper bag.

I would recommend walking a little further to Burrito Boyz -but if your craving is not allowing you to walk that distance, just around the corner is Burrito bandidos. You get a better ,bigger, toaster deal for your buck there.
