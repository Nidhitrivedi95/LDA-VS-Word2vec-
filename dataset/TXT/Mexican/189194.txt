oaNml4cV5D_MHMOVjNS-Bg This place isn't bad for how much food they give you. The only problem is that carne asada has that same quality of flavors as you would get as if you were shopping at Ranch Market-no frills/extraordinary flavors, but the taste is still there. But overall the place looked promising as it was packed upon entering. Willing to try this place again, but will try something different.
