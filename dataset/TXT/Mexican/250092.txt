UJb1PrUWDFfuzwUPc1pP4Q I've eaten at most of the restaurants in downtown Tempe so I believe I have a good understanding of what's good and what's not when it comes to food, drinks and service. 

El Hefe is one of those places where the food, atmosphere and service is consistently good. Of course you must enjoy Mexican food. And I do. Their tacos are flavorful and nicely presented on wooden serving trays. The food usually arrives before the first sip of beer is done. 

The staff is very friendly. I'm greeted with smiles and hello's when ever I show up...which is frequent...precisely because of the exceptional service I receive. Any problems are handled promptly and without fuss. They clearly want a happy customer.

Kudos to Brandi, Hailey, Bella, Candace, Marissa, Brittini, Daney, Austin, Jamie, Marcel, Alexis...and others for great service.

I highly recommend it for the food and atmosphere...it's festive and fun. But what makes El Hefe the El Chingon...are the beautiful souls that work there. 

One more thing...it turns into a totally insane nightclub after 10 pm...a bit much for this old dog...but for the young at heart it's one rocking affair.
