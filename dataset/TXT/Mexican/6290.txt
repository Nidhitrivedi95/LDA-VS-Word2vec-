_FXa_6j-6UDsxWo-KX7WvQ I dropped my car off at Santan VW for maintenance and told my bf I was hungry. I was craving Mexican for breakfast and found this little spot nearby. I walked in and got a hello from a guy who was sitting down. The girl that was on the cash register didnt look or seem friendly. I didnt want to judge but she just looked annoyed. I asked if they served breakfast only. She answers no we serve everything in a monotone voice. I had the carne asada plate, bf had the breakfast quesadilla, and we had horchata for our drink. We waited 15 mins for food. The girl running the cash register served us our food when it was finally cooked. I noticed they had a lot of native american designs in their restaurant which I thought was cool. I asked oh are you guys native because I see the designs you have. She says what do you mean? I repeated myself and said umm I dont know... Then she walks away. Made me feel dumb for even trying to start a convo with her. Sorry for ruining your morning. Geez. The food was good. I liked the taste of my carne asada. Tortillas was fresh because it was made right then and there. Rice was a little too salty and mushy. My bf liked their quesadilla. The red sauce was the best! The spicyness was perfect. Not too spicy or too hot for those who cant handle spicy food. Green sauce was just okay. I preferred their red sauce. Will I come back? Probably not because of the rudeness of the girl who served us today. I come for awesome service not just how good the food is. And plus there are other mexican places I can go around Chandler and Gilbert area. I didnt even get a goodbye or thanks for coming guys. And they saw us walked out. Ehh first and last visit.. 3 stars overall for food and service was no bueno..
