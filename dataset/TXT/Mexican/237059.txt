SW6ZQk22G1_CV81_gfnvNQ I really wanted to give La Carnita more stars. I'll explain the good aspects of the meal and then move on to why I removed two stars.

The chips, guac and tacos were amazing. We had the beef cheek and the calamari. Both were outstanding; great flavours, nice size and a delicious tortilla that didn't rip apart or need to be doubled up. Guac was very nice, although I wish they offered a small bowl of salsa as well for the price. Chips had a dusting of chili powder on them which was fun and unique.

Pitcher or Margaritas for $60 is a solid choice. Not too sweet and the right balance of lime and tequila. If you like your margs, this is far the better deal than individual drinks.
Service was really great. We rarely wanted for anything and they all seemed to be happy and communicating well with one another.

Now the not so great:

HOLY HELL WAS IT LOUD!!!

Hey, I like loud music, but at 5:30 pm? This place has more of a 2 am vibe. I think that the concept works to get people in and out quickly, but I would be way better if they didn't open until 10pm and stayed open until 3 am. I could seriously pack back some of these tacos after a night and drinking and dancing. I actually could not hear my friend at all by the end of the meal. We couldn't speak a word to one another until we got outside.

The tres leches cake was really gross. I don't usually order dessert, but everything up until that point was so good that I wanted to try this specific dessert. It was like a soggy strawberry shortcake in a cup and tasted like it was made a month ago. My friend agreed that it was a pretty disappointing dessert. Waste of calories-- I should have had another drink, instead.

I think I may stick to Playa Cabana for my sit down taco fix.
