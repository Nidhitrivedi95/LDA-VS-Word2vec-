JSHUcxKlD6c_zZ1_YUBl6A I hate to be the one to write a negative review . However, it is necessary to do it. I've been here 3 times and all those 3 times I have  waited way to long to get my food. Not to mention it is cold by the time I get it. Also the staff seams to be lacking training they are all over the place and not as efficient as other Del Tacos. And lastly the food is not consistent with the other Del Tacos in town . I really hope they get it together soon.
