j4170xdQJTwSvXFpsQzWtg Excited to get some spanish food, we decided to try this place since it's right down the street from where we live. After being sat we waited for about 10 minutes and no one came to great us or take a drink order. another table walked in. There were now 2 tables in the restaurant.  Seeing as the other couple was spanish and my girlfriend and I are white the other table was greated immediately and their drink order was taken. The waiter being right behind us could of turned around to ask us for a drink order, but no. He looked at us and walked away. We got up and walked out. We will not be returning
