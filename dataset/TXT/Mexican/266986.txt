wI39PmfZ40Zg_yB48Jo5zw This Del Taco is near and dear to my heart. I can clearly recall it's initial construction in the Fry's  parking lot across the way from Burger King. My heart boasted with a glistening excitement that a young 11 year old boy couldn't possibly contain. 

Flash forward to modern day and this Del Taco is surprisingly adequate. Parking is rather  accommodating, and the drive-thru is very easy to navigate. Inside, bright colors line the walls and plenty of padded booths are available for seating. There's a soda fountain and small condiment bar to one side with an impressively large menu and order counter. A front patio is also available. 

Pro tip: when ordering, if you ask to "go bold", your order will include French Fries and Diablo Sauce in it! Of course there is an additional fee. Using your imagination, you can probably surmise a few palatable "Bold" concoctions of your own. 

Interesting observation: the drive-through orders are very loudly played back via an intercom system. When you're sitting inside, you can hear each customer's orders that are in the drive through. It's kind of fun and intetesting. 

The employees here are fair and friendly. I haven't had an unpleasant experience here once! And throughout the years, I have noticed that the operation hours have changed. They are no longer open 24 hours. 

7am-3am Monday - Sunday. 

Random fact: I always ask for El Scorcho Sauce. It's the same exact thing as medium, I just like to refer to it by Del Taco's official Sauce title, which often goes overlooked. 

Updated breakfast hours: 7am - 3pm! 
Their breakfast dollar menu rocks my socks!! :P or maybe that's the $1 Breakfast Rollers talking..
