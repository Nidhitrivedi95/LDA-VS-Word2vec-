FI-8LPGkc8D_hwx0l0zyyg Blanco is the perfect casual, laid-back atmosphere to grab some great food and drinks... however it may be a bit TOO laid-back. 

Went here to wind down on Sunday night shenanigans with my girls, grab a few drinks and some food. It wasn't too busy around 7pm, and we got seated right away. Our waitress came over and introduced herself, and asked our drink order. We didn't know which margarita we wanted right away, however our waitress recommended a few, and we made our choices. We also ordered water, because let's face it -- we live in AZ. We were all chatting and getting caught up in our conversation, but we did notice that our margaritas made it over to our table before our water... a bit out of the ordinary. Then we had to ask for water again before it was brought over -- maybe she forgot? 

We didn't order much since we wanted to get together more than anything; I definitely wasn't impressed with the service though. The food was okay... we got some chips and salsa, and ordered some guacamole to go along with it. We also got two Mexican chopped salads that were pretty good. The service was fairly slow overall, and not very on-point. Not sure if we went on an "off" night?

I might stop by Blanco again, perhaps for a drink at the bar, but not quite sure I'd do dinner there again. Sorry.
