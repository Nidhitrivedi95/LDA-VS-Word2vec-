K-uQkfSUTwu5LIwPB4b_vg Have to say I feel this place has gone down in quality since my last visit about a year ago.  The dishes were very small portions for what was charged, and all of us felt our dishes were overcooked, particularly when it came to the fish. Service and ambiance are great, but the quality of the food is not in line with what they charge.
