NOfbzTpQ7hrt6ZbJVeXUUw This is the worst restaurant I have been to in a long time.  It was on a Sunday afternoon with maybe 8 other people in the place.  The service was horrible, over a 40 minute wait for our food (a table of 4), our drinks never got refilled and we were charged for chips that we never received.
