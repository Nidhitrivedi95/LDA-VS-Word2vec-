gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw You have to try this place!  We stopped for breakfast and had the steak breakfast tacos and the burrito.  They were both fantastic and had their own separate flavors.  We also had dinner.  The service at the bar was not as good as I had hoped, but don't let it stop you from dining here.  The tres leches was also amazing!  Great place to eat!
