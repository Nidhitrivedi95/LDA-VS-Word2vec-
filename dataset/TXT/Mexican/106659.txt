Flu85aQ9mdeL0dyja4Vv0A Worst customer service. My boyfriend and I got two burritos, they put on the wrong sauces and had a bad attitude towards fixing it. The blonde wrapping them basically spilled our burritos into the foil and didn't bother to fix it leaving the bag it was placed in with remnants of our burritos everywhere. Never going back to that Chipotle.
