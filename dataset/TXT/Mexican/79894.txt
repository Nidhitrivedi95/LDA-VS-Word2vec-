cwCLcQns_SSExsBCzWNQDA Hands-down the best burrito in town. None of the big chains compare to the freshly grilled chicken and steak, toasted (not steamed) tortillas and moist, sticky (not dry) rice. Everything about the flavors are perfect.

Fresh salsas, made on-site are the finishing touch. 

I've been eating at Phat Burrito almost every week since they opened, years ago. Consistently better than all the other chains.

We are so lucky to have this landmark right here in Southend.
