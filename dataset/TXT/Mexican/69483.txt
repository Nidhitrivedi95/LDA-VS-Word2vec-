BQJokxJ4y4s57i7Mn65pvA The food here was really just ok. I came here for lunch with a party of 5 and was slightly disappointed. I guess coming from LA I expect a little more from Mexican food. I ordered the Carne Asada burrito and it was really bland. The one thing I will say is that the drinks here are pretty good.
