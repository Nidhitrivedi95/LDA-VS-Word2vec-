eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw Ok...  so lets preface this review by saying we rolled in here at 2 am, completely annihilated.  We didn't order any drinks.  We were WAY past that point.  We did, however, need sustenance.  So the 4 of us split some wings and a plate of nachos.  Both were hits.  Service was grate, they were well accustomed to our kind and we're funny and didn't get annoyed with the drunken antics.  We sat outside so I can't really speak much to the inside except the bathrooms.  They could have been a bit cleaner but at 2am on a saturday in Vegas, beggars can't be choosers and I was just happy they were functional. The guys actually wanted to come back the next night for drunk food, it was solid.  If you happen to be downtown late at night, you should stop in.
