Voeq7aGDmCGMjE_SQiHwRA This place is amazing and has a great atmosphere. Every time I go the food has been unreal. The Bistec Steak Taco's could literally stop a war they're so good. Guacamole is made fresh and is phenomenal. I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoy's Mexican/Tex Mex food. I would not recommend going in groups larger than 4. There's always people in large groups waiting that get pissed off because they don't have a table for 7 readily available. Dinning in the cultural district is not designed for larger parties.
