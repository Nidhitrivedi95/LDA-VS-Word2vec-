hntnEJN_wGWG7KQjZ4aVLQ Fantastic food at a great price. We went for the less than $8 lunch especials. We were greated by a thick almost smokey salsa and freshly made chips. Before we could empty the basket our meals came out hot. The cheese sauce on the chimichanga was top tier. The rice and beans were also very good. The whole experience was muy bueno.
