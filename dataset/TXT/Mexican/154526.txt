K-uQkfSUTwu5LIwPB4b_vg Came here for a late night pre-game before a bachelor party. Parking kind of sucks but the food was good. 

I had the Creekstone Filet rare which was delicious. Drinks were well done. Had a few shots of something that tasted like coconut and it was well made by the mixologist. 

Pricing was reasonable. All in all, well worth the trip.
