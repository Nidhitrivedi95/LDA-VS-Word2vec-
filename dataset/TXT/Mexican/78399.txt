cnWo1tPCcTo1qbLh0UHpQA Normally when I come to Tijuana Flats I have had good experiences but this time not so much. We ordered nachos (minus the toppings) and 1) there barely wasn't any Queso and 2) there weren't a lot of chips. We have ordered this meal plenty of times and hadn't had this issue before so unsure if it was just a bad day.

The service was amazing and people are constantly checking on you to make sure you are enjoying your meal. We could have said something but we didn't want to complain about the portion of our food since it tasted fine but I was a little upset at how much we paid versus what we got. I'll go again to give it another try.
