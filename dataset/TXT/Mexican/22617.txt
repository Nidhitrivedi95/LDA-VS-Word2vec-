2j78b8m1w4Sr2GVGCzFBtQ My friend and I came here two days in a row. It was quite yummy! The chips are salsa are sooo good. The first time I went I had the beef brisket and the second day I had the chicken tacos. I think my favorite was the chicken. The chicken tacos were a little too juicy for my liking but overall the flavors for both tacos were amazing!
