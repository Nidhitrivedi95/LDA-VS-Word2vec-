gT4gngtGKYOW-jl5UIBahg This is a family run start-up.  Very basic basic furnishing but it's very clean. They've only been open a little over two months. We ordered the Culichi Especial and the Gorditas.  Beautifully Plated. ...fresh lovely ingredients and very tasty!   Service was fast,  server was helpful and friendly! The salsa was homemade and HOT! The Culichi Especial was definitely CRAVE ABLE!   We will be back! Overlook the furnishings and go enjoy the food!
