IkMwuS3eViVHK09npuG1jQ This is the worst place to go to. Cashier rang up our order incorrectly. He itemized our order instead of using the coupon code.  Because of that mistake, that did not show up on the screen for the other workers to prepare the food. So we waited more than 10 mins for our order.  We get our food and guess what.  My order was wrong.  These people do not know how to read the order.  They should have made my food right when they knew they made a mistake. Managers are no where to be found. Never coming back here again.
