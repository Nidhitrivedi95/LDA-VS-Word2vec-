ZcAoKSDT6BNcWsn3o4-WVA We came for the live music, which was great! I love that they have bands there on the weekends. But the food and drinks weren't great. I had a margarita which was way too sweet. I sent it back, and they remade it the same. They are pre-mixed so there's no room for change. The thing is, in Madison, there's an incredible craft cocktail scene, so the competition is stiff and many of us don't want an overly sweet pre-mixed drink but a legit, tangy, margarita. The chips and salsa were also mediocre (compared to places like Eldorado Grill, Tex Tubbs, Laredo's). I'd try it one more time for dinner in a pinch, perhaps after they've had a little more time to grow.
