c_xCs0pCLZVM6ImvqXEFPA This was my favorite Mexican food since moving to Nevada. So maybe tonight is a fluke, but I ordered rolled tacos aka taquitos and they were the worse I have ever tasted. The guacamole looks & tastes at least two days old and the tortilla is soft and soggy.  It will be awhile be I go back.
