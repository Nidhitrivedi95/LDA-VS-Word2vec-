a4L-Fy0agN3RNM7O49bIHA I'm lucky to have this place in my neighborhood, although I'd happily drive any distance for what I consider the best tacos and margaritas in the valley. The atmosphere inside is unexpectedly hip and warm, a true gem hidden within a commercial complex. The weekly deals are a steal for incredibly top notch food, and the servers are knowledgeable and friendly. Lauren recognized me my 2nd time in, and welcomed me back like an old friend. Be sure to ask for the "secret" dessert, a family recipe from the chef - you'll be glad you did!
