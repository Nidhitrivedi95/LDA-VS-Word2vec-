zCmwErM82hdKl4L2UixDJw I frequent the Tremont location so I was excited to check out Barrios Lakewood joint. I was hesitant because it's a fairly new restaurant but I was impressed by how everything was very similar to the Tremont location, although I like the bar layout of the other location better. 

I usually go to Barrio for one reason only, happy hour! Tacos are two dollars and you pick the ingredients yourself so it's a fun process. I usually make one spicy and one sweet. We also tried the chorizo queso for the first time and for someone that doesn't really like queso, this blew me out of the water. It was sooooo good. Barrio is a CLE happy hour staple!
