The Eloite was a little overdone but tasty.  The guacamole was not good.  My husband loved his meal recommended by the waiter tampenqueno something (steak mushrooms onion and bacon).  I ordered a chili relleno stuffed with beef.  It was not battered apparently you have to ask for it to be battered.  I did not like it because it was not battered so the chiii was slimy and it was WAY WAY too much meat under it but the green sauce I asked for instead of the normal ranchero on top was amazing!!  Next time I will try a battered cheese stuffed relleno
