NkcT0GT7Xt2mtvIgHSxOcw Great flavor and very well good size servings. I am mexican and its been a disappointment altogether to live here in Toronto without enough good places to eat real mexican favors and not to be confused with TeXmex which is what you would eat in the US. Try it with a beer and enjoy it for a low cost. I recommend this place folks!
