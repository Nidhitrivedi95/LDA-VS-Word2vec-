CZhc8YXdFLhAI4ViC2ERTg This place has some great Mexican food. Everything is fresh and tastes homemade.  The staff is friendly and take care of you right away. I was hesitant to get the tomales, because I never can find good ones at restaurants, but after eating there once and being so impressed with their dishes, I decided to try the beef tomales with red sauce and they were great! They were really moist and tasted like my family made them.  This is definitely my favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas!
