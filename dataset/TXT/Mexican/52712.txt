9KeJfn7-6DFfUFoZLu_DNQ Cool mexican restaurant ! Located on Union avenue in downtown Montreal near Phillips Square and opened since the end of April, I heard a lot about this place all over and finally tried out. I was not dissapointed at all. The place was jam pack, so popular. The waitress was like you have 1h to eat. Ok. A bit rush but it was worth it. Nice vibe, beautiful & authentic mexican decoration into a big industrial loft. Delicious guacamole 6$ for entrees, the ceviche 11$ was good, the ribs 13$ were so delicious, the tacos were ok, my michelada 11$ was refreshing. Service was very fast & pleasant, prices are good. Totally converted, I will need to good back to taste more of the menu + drinks. ¡Buen provecho!
