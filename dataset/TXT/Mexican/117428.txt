This restaurant serves Latin American fare that leaves me wanting more. Chica's three-course Restaurant Week menu is a value at $20 for lunch. 

First Course: Kale Salad - There's two ways to eat kale (1) in a smoothie and (2) the Chica way. The description of the kale salad is unimpressive, to tell you the truth. It seems like a regular 'ol kale salad with pumpkin seeds, dried cranberries, croutons, sour green apples, and Napa  What makes this dynamite is the salad's lime vinaigrette mixed in with all its ingredients. The portion is generous.

Second Course: Shrimp & Quinoa: I was just thinking if shrimp goes well with cheese. In this case with the shrimp and quinoa dish, yes, yes it does go well. The four or five shrimp and the corn poblano pico "crown" the quinoa and the cubes of Guayanés cheese. The entire dish is flavorful with an occasional spicy kick in every other bite. 

Third Course: Lemon Buñelos: Two donuts with soft centers. These was crispy, citrusy, and delightful. If you need to satisfy a sweet tooth, I would pass on this. It's too bad that there's only one dessert option on the Restaurant Week menu; I would liked to have seen another option.

Overall: The food is solid, and the cuisine is worth the try if you're searching for something to eat in the area that isn't the traditional Italian and steakhouse offerings.
