pomGBqfbxcqPv14c3XH-ZQ We came to try Leticia's for the first time today. It looks so beautiful from the outside so we looked it up on yelp and it has great reviews. So we decided to try it. 

Miguel was our waiter, we was very friendly and outgoing. He was overwhelmed with the dining area because it seems that he was the only waiter there. 
We were the very first customers to arrive today and once more ppl arrived it was almost impossible to leave. We waited 15 minutes before we were able to catch Miguel to get our check. Someone else picked our plates up 15 minutes prior to us being able to get the check. 

Food wasn't all that great, everything had a smoky flavor. My carne asada was super dry and was hardly warm, the taste was smoky and salty. The rice was delicious soft and fluffy but beans were salty. 

Chips were good but also very salty. The verde salsa is tasty but has a lot of cilantro in it. The red salsa was very smoky as well. The bean dip was good but wasn't all that hot. 

The atmosphere was comfortable and the decorations were beautiful. The facility is very clean considering we found cockroaches outside.
