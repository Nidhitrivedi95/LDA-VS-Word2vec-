rb9B9v8TJk-sjpJe3BbkBQ Straight up trash! Second time I try to go here to get some quick tacos and end up waiting over 30 minutes! Other locations have normal service, but this location needs some serious work with their employees. 

The cashier was trying to use the computer and couldn't figure it, then started using an iPad. She spent 5 minutes to get one order through. Meanwhile multiple tables were waiting for their food and 2 people waiting for Togo orders. We couldn't handle the wait anymore and just went to Amado's where we got our food in 7minutes.
