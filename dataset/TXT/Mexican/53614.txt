Fish taco at 101 is simple, clean & fresh tasting.  Nothing fancy and unpretentious.  I prefer eating here than at Seven Lives Tacos because mainly it's not a hipster hangout where people think what they are eating is authentic.  Most importantly the tacos at 101 are more believable as a staple in a Mexican household because the staff preparing the tacos speak Spanish as their native tongue.  And economically, it's about $2 cheaper for the same product than at Seven Lives.

Self-serve homemade hot sauce station is available on the counter.  Adding both mild and medium hot sauce gives it more flavour. Just wish they would expand as it gets quite crowded in the tiny space during peak hours.
