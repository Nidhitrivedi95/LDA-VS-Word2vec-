d8lmIZIqmBC9oPM8y1dc7Q I am from Los Angeles and we know real Mexican food and this is not Mexican food.  The refried beans are from a can, you can taste the preservatives.  If you like boxed Mexicans rice this is the place for you.  The service was amazing they truly give you the Noth Carolina hospitality smiles.  I came here because of the reviews and I am sure the regulars here might like it and think this is Mexican food but I compare this place to Chilis bar and Grill, if there is one here. It's the Taco Bell of Mexican food.
