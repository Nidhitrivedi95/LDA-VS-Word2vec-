a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg Very nicely owned family restaurant. Waiters & servers well mannered & also the dinning was great. Food.. WAS GREAT. Although they did mess up my burrito w sour cream (im vegan) they provided a new one w no charge & very fast. They take family photos & just provide excellent service will come back.
