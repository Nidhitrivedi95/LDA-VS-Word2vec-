9pWzjhdrPgsZEmF7-QOaIQ - What I have tried: ALL from the menu lol. My two favourites are Al Pastor and Cartinas. I thought the fish taco was ok, but apparently it's the most expensive one 
- Food quality: extremely good. Toppings, meat and sauces all blend very well together, nothing to complain about.
- Drink: I only tried the Guava one (it's actually a glass bottle, not house-made guava tho). I thought it was ok, definitely not worth $3
- Portion: generous amount of meat and toppings, but I usually need 2 tacos to be completely full
- Price: $4 each except fish taco which is $4.50. I think the price is fair
- The place is very small so not a lot of seats. However people are in and out a lot so there is always space.
- Overall, I would come back :)
