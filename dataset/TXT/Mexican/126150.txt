hU7z5Jtl57RIODS0hPg9Ug I know this place has a lot of good reviews, but I honestly don't see how that many people think it's great. Have you folks never had real Mexican food? 

My boyfriend and I tried this place for the first time last night and we were not impressed.

This place is NOT real Mexican food. The beans had a grey milky tint to them and were entirely flavorless. The tortilla was soggy. Seriously, how do you mess up a bean and cheese burrito?!? What are these... Fake beans? Powdered beans? Yuck Yuck Yuck!! 

My boyfriend ordered a quesadilla and it looked like a taco.

I noticed they were advertising some seasonings and thought it was odd. 

We got an order of carne asada fries and they were terrible. First of all, who the hell makes carne asada fries with big fat steak fries?!? Yuck! The carne asada looked like chili and was very sausey. To top it off it was loaded with their seasoning. Yuck! Since when does carne asada fries have seasoning? I mean these were covered in a disgusting seasoning. The seasoning is really not appropriate for this dish. I'm fairly certain this was one of the seasonings advertised. Maybe some people like it, but it wasn't for us.

I gave it two stars because the place was really clean inside and the hot sauce was great. The service was also really good. 

This appears to be a one man show. I can see how that could be a problem at times. 

Perhaps I'm so disappointed because I'm from San Diego and know what real Mexican food tastes like! 

I really wish the owner would consider using higher quality ingredients. 

This place just isn't for us. Everything was a few dollars more than other places. With so many other taco shops to choose from, we won't be returning.
