oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ I was looking forward to trying this restaurant but ended up leaving because after requesting a high top table we were left standing around for 10+ minutes and never got seated. The hostess was clearly not pleased with our request and was very rude in telling us we would have to wait for the high top to be cleared. The place was not busy at all and the table was hardly dirty so it should have only taken someone 2 minutes to clean and reset it. We were standing between the table and bar when the hostess came up to us and told us to move closer to the bar because it was a health code violation to stand next to the table. Maybe that's true, I don't know but we literally only moved 6 inches away to appease her. In the meantime several bus boys and wait staff were circling around but I guess we were not important enough to clean a table that only had two empty glasses on it. After standing around more, nobody acknowledged us again so we left. Terrible, terrible customer service.
