plHKBwA18aWeP-TG8DC96Q Three instead of four stars for a couple reasons... One- too long of a wait. Tacos are great but the two hour wait is a little too much. But I do understand why... With so few good places to eat, that's why you wait! Service- waited two hours, ate dinner, had $100 in cocktails during that hour, and they shoved the check in our face so they could close and we were not the only table left. We would have had another drink. Our bill was around $150 for four. I will say their gin and tonic cocktail w/ St. Germaine is really good.
