a7_loah6BE8V9nJY3tt36g Gringo friendly staff. Prices are comparable to other marisco restaurants in the area. I thought the music was a bit loud, but it tends to be in these places. Although it seems pricey, portion sizes of campechana and soup were large with lots of seafood. Flavors were great. I really had to ding at least one star due to an issue with my 7 mares soup (my go to mariscos dish). Fish still had the skin and bones on it. I spent most of the meal picking out soggy fish skin and bones. Didn't get all the bones and choked on quite a few. I'd go back, but I doubt if I'd order the soup again.
