SFaIhuHpxnM0PJLQB1uAHw Very glad they replaced Metro Pizza with Soho. Every time I pass by, I see a line for bowls and burritos. Their lines are long for a reason- the food is good and different from the other options offered in UNLV's Student Union. They have premade rolls and bowls for quick ordering, or you can make your own bowl/burrito. The price depends on what protein you get. Spicy salmon, tomago, tofu, & krab are around $5.50. Specialty toppings like seaweed salad, masago, & guac are an extr $0.50. Bowls are large and well worth the price. I should mention that the bowls are compostable!!!! :-) 
The young employees are more than pleasant to interact with! Best service you'll find in the SU.
