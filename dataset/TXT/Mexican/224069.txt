RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg Food was great! As we got there we saw huge lines and thought "oh boy, this is gonna take a while" but to our surprise, line was moving fast and we got to order before we knew it. Only thing I recommend for them to add, is hot sauces.. maybe where they have the limes. You can't have tacos and no hot sauce. But over all it was great. 8 tacos and a drink for $22.
