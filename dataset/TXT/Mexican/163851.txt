LGEIsxeJQATo9J1IA-TEdA Been eating here for 18 years, never had a bad experience. Shrimp fajitas in those fresh warm shells are fantastic. Cadillac steak and the chicken fajitas are also great, but the shrimp is the star. Queso dip is good too!

Margaritas are good, beer is cold and the service has always been great... what more do you need? Go early if it's a weekend, place gets packed fast.
