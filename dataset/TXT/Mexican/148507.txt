jScBTQtdAt-8RshaiBEHgw Nice new place to go to for a weekend brunch.  Ordered the Bibim Ba and it was a pretty good size serving. I'm a big fan of locally owned businesses and would most definitely come back here to try out their other dishes. Matt, the owner/chef came out and greeted us to make sure that everything is good which is a plus
