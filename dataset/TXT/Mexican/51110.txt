95CCHowiE0W_ovv5-9lQAQ So I was fiendin' for a burger,but I wanted something that tasted like those LA, off the street, momma& her uncle's kinda burger. The kind that taste totally different from a Red Robin burger and more than 3x the tastiness. I had myself a pastrami Boyger--super delish! I'm not a mayo fan,and even though I saw some of that gooey sauce Caucasian ppl go ape for, it was not a problem! The pastrami had a nice thin texture, but there was so much of it--I'm sure it made half the weight of my burger! AND OMJIZZLE GUYS!!ZUCCHINI STICKS!! they looked like little cheese sticks,so they were probably a little more processed than the ones you'd get at Farmer Boys,but their crunch and flavor was addicting! I'll go back for just those fersure! Alex grabbed a monster boyger, which was a typical burger,just more meat, but man oh man,I'm took a bite before I had a bite of my own burger and for a few seconds as I enjoyed that mouthwatering goodiness, I regretted my choice. Luckily, we live close by, because we WILL BE BAAAACK
