After all, El Dorado Cantina is considered one of the best high end Mexican resto in the city. We arrived at 7 p.m., on time for our reservation and despite the restaurant being not busy, we were told to wait an extra 20 mins for our table - no biggie, since they then proceed to seat us on a comfy booth table, overlooking the main dining area of the restaurant. The space was quite spacious, decorated with bold Mexican flair, rather old school, but romantic at the same time - we loved it! 

They started us off with a complimentary chips and salsas, and their version of two salsas was truthfully one of the best to date. They are spicy, fresh and addicting! The chips were also crunchy.

For the food the two of us ordered and shared: 

* Grilled Steak fajita: I was disappointed with how this dish turned out when it's served to me. I was expecting it would be presented on a hot sizzling skillet, but the meat was cold... Probably, it has been sitting out for a while. The server also fails to bring us the tortillas and the rest of the sides that come with the fajita, that we have to request it TWICE! Other than that slightly big mistake, the flavors were all good!

* Octopus and Chorizo taco: Just one bite of this and I'm done... It honestly tasted horrible, super bland and the octopus was really dry and rubbery, ugh. 

* Short rib taco: The highlight of the night! I love short ribs, especially if it's really nicely seasoned and super tender like this one! Definitely one of the most stunning taco I've tried so far. 

The service was kinda off; distant attitude, missing orders and as we waited what seems like forever for our food, the waitress hardly ever checks in on us. The food was actually good, but not THAT good that we can look beyond the bad services, lol. Overall, happy to have tried this once, but don't think I will be counting on El Dorado for a splendid Mexican meal in the near future.
