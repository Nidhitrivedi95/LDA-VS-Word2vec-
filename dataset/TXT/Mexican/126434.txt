HumV0E5AE0MmyusDpd0b7w If I am giving it 4 stars I like it, and it is consistently good, be it 11 am or 11pm. Check it out price comparison vs Mc D's # 3 taco and enchilada 8.10 vs double qtr pounder value large 8.65. You'll be more full at Ramiros....aint  b.s. the shit is good. Don't wanna wait phone ahead, after developing a repor it'll be ready and hot. My pico degallo kicks theirs in the ass, but I cant expect theirs to contain the love and attention I put into mine. So anyway I highly freakin recommend this joint you want it real you get it real all damn day or all night.
