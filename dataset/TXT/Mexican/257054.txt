VIJ2KiDKhUVhhpNylEIfog I'll start by saying I'm a foodie snob; I choose carefully and wisely about food options- and I love my local businesses. I decided on a Friday evening to first give Maize a try- bad decision, floods of people waiting in the rain and a frat party. On Saturday I tried again around late noon, just a small line outside the door. Previously, I thought the task would be getting into Maize and ordering- think again, it's actually finding parking, then maneuvering into a spot or parking stalking. On this occasion I did all the above whilst driving, during rush hour and graduation...All for good reason. 

THIS STUFF IS THE BIZNOMB FORRIZEAL, holy guacamole, pass the salsa, slap my momma and sit down- if you're standing up! As soon as I bit into a chip the stress of traffic from the U of I graduation began to fade, even as mini van mom almost took me out in traffic...no worries though. There's Breaking Bad and Breaking Tacos- I prefer the latter, with well seasoned cooked carne asada, fresh guacamole and pico de gallo- the drive home was so delicious! Were there fireworks? Did my foot pop à la Princess Diaries? I believe so. Either way I'm very happy that I'm athletic because this could easily make a chiquita, gordita... Ain't nothing wrong with a little extra topping though.

Bottom line (literally) If you like authentic Mexican food outside of Chicago then vámanos! This restaurant is THE champagne of Champaign and perhaps the Midwest region.
