I779CNMLWhZu6BxkGfLvwQ Headed here the first week they opened. Had the calamari and deviled eggs off the appetizer menu and could have finished the night hovering on this part of the menu! Dinner'd with scallops entree and a mac & cheese dish. Sat at a high top that 8 near open patio. Great ambiance, great food. We'll be back soon.
