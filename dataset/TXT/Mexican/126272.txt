Happy servers that while new, do everything they can to keep you happy. 

For a Friday and Saturday, expect a long wait. 60-90 minutes will probably happen. With the patio, maybe only 45 minutes. 

Food has all been above average. 

Only single flour tortillas for each taco is the only spot that I take away points for them so far. The rest has been solid.
