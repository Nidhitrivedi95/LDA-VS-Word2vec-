ASC3JV2Jh09lTyJZ98UMFA Was very pleased with this restaurant.  The parking lot was pretty full and it was extremely hot outside, but inside it was nice and cool.  We were seated right away and chips were on the table in under a minute.  While I like my salsa on the spicer side it wasn't bad.  I ordered the special for the day chicken fajitas and the wife had chicken quesadillas.  Both came out with huge portions of rice, beans, and veggies.  
One thing I can't stand is chicken fajitas with no flavoring but these were good and there were mushrooms included which I've never had before.  Very good.  One thing that surprised us was the cheese dip which had a small amount of refried beans at the bottom and wow it was good.

All in all we have been looking for a good place to eat by the mall and this hit the spot for us.  Great food, and great service with a smile. We will definitely be back.
