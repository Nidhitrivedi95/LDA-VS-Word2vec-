NL-ymrd7jsk4MscQRgtPJQ Ok. So let me start by saying there is NOTHING wrong with the food or service here. It's your classic Roberto's knock off with a full 24 hour menu. 

However -- Laurita's is inside the sketchiest gas station on Boulder Highway. I've scurried out more than once to avoid being witness to a holdup. (Don't judge). If it wasn't for the bad location, I'd eat there more often. 

So, my advice?  Go during high traffic hours. I've never had trouble during the morning or afternoon commute. The food is really good. Everything is fresh and made to order. They have a couple little tables to wait while they cook. But it's not really a place to eat. It is inside a gas station, after all. 


The tacos and burritos are on point. I love the breakfast burritos and honestly, I can never eat the whole thing. The meat is always well seasoned, the veggies are fresh, and the rice is tasty.  

The prices are standard. I think everyone in town charges almost the same thing. But, the staff is friendly and service is quick. 

Lauritas - 5 stars
Location - not safe at night.
