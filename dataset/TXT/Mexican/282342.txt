XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg BY FAR ONE OF THE BEST DINING EXPERIENCES IN MY LIFE. Unforgettable!

Even if Will Smith "flashy thinged" me like in Men In Black.. I would remember the pear cactus margarita and the rabbit entree I had at Mesa Grill.

The flavors are unlike anything your average home cook can put together. AND THAT MY FRIENDS is why people should be dining out in the first place. How many times do you go out to eat and think "I can make this at home". I know I do, a lot! Most of the time its about being waited on and the atmosphere. Well at Mesa Grill, it is about all of the above. 

The duck quesadilla was split and I literally only got one bite (as did the other 2 at the table with me) but it was so worth it. All of our eyes lit up when we put the fork into our mouthes. The coffee rubbed steak, the pork tenderloin as well as my rabbit was all so delicious.

Word to the wise: just dont cancel your reservation, there is a $75.00 fee if you need to cancel the day of past 3 pm. We didn't, just were warned. :)
