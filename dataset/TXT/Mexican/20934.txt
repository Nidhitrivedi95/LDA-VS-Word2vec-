2EseSYpIwW6JaA0wUojd4Q I love the food here but the service is terrible. The waitress pretty much ignored us until halfway through the meal (the food was delivered by kitchen staff) and when we were finished, it took her 15 minutes to bring us the check! When you have a restless toddler, that 15 minutes can be agonizing. If they kicked up their customer service a bit, it would be a great place to eat.
