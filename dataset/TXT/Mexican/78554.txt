CQokoa1vN8j6OP7dyizJDw I had only been to a Chipotle 2-3 times about 8 years ago and enjoyed it very much, but I don't get the opportunity to visit Chipotle very much these days.  While on business travel I was in a hurry and in looking at the options close by, decided to get a burrito bowl.  The food was great, very fresh.  I thought the staff were helpful and made sure you were aware of things that were an extra cost.  They also re-wrapped another customer's burrito when it started to tear.

Iced tea here was very good and fresh.
