_WtxQbDK7B-ExGdeG-2j6Q This place is rockin' on so many levels. My group decided to go downstairs, and I am so glad we did. The dungeon-like entrance so reminded me of some great European restaurants that I've been to in the same vein.

Once downstairs, our party of four sat at the bar corner so we could talk to one another, and because all the tables were reserved. If you want a table downstairs even on a Sunday night, I would suggest that you call for reservations! The bar, however, was a great experience.

Nicole, our server, was knowledgeable and sweet. She recommended the trout that one member of my party had that was soooo good.

They don't skimp on the food either. My plate was brimming over with food, and Nicole kindly boxed up what I couldn't eat.

With half price (starred on the menu) bottles of wine night, we opened a bottle of red cab that easily slid down our throats. 

Great food, great server, great experience.
