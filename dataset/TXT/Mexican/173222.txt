mFGUvyJSdSRjIaN94QW_IQ Just visiting the area and didn't have a lot of time so we decided to give this place a try.  We are so glad we did. The place is so bright and colorful (and clean), the service was terrific and the people that work there really seem to care about everything (customers, food, service, etc.). I had the traditional burrito, my wife had a chicken caesar salad and my son had some kind of Chimichanga.  The food was so fresh and flavorful, even the chips and salsa were on point.
