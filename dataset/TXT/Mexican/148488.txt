Food: 4.5/5

I actually enjoyed the food quality at Served. It also helps that the restaurant is a new and upcoming brunch place a few minutes from my house! Tucked away in a business office plaza, Served has two large banners that identifies the building from the outside. The inside decor wasn't too attractive and was a bit too dark. 

Upon entering, we had to wait a few minutes before the "only waitress" finished helping the other guests to get seated for a party of 5. The reason why I gave service 3/5 was because: 
1) there was one waitress for 10 tables 
2) the poor lady was overwhelmed and had a queue of service requests from all the patrons

We had to wait awhile before we even ordered our food. It was even more frustrating that a table or two got their food before us when we clearly got there first. Again, I totally don't blame her. The restaurant just needs to staff more waiters and waitresses at this place. She forgot things there and here, but I couldn't blame her. We got our free chips about 15 minutes after being seated. 10 tables to 1 waitress is insane.

As for the food --- oh boy! I loved it! I ordered the Bi Bim Ba. It was mhmmmm good! The meat was a slight tougher for my liking, but it was deliciously grilled and seasoned. I'm interested in trying the Miso Belly Sandwich next. My table shared the Baked Berry French Toast and it was sooo good! I highly reccomend this as a dessert to finish off any meal.

Overall, I'd reccomend giving this place another shot to see if the service gets better. For brunch, I highly reccomend coming here.
