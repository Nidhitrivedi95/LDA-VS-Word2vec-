XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg One of the best dining experiences I've had to date. They say that the mark of a good chef is how well you can make sauces. The food was incredible but the sauces took our meal to a new level. We started with apps. Squash blossoms and the grilled shrimp tamale. Then main courses of the chipotle rib eye that melts in your mouth. The ancho chili and honey glazed salmon as well as the spiced rubbed pork tenderloin. There is nothing bad I can say about anything we had. The entire dining experience was wonderful. Deanna, our server, was great. We will be back to try other menu items and work our way through the margarita menu too.
