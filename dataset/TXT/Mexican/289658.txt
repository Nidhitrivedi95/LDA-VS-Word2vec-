YM-nYIHd99qUt9n62AxIAg I first went to Carlos O'Briens for a staff luncheon and actually found the food to be better than expected. Since then, it's become sort of a default choice whenever we're in no mood to take a risk on a new Mexican restaurant.

The layout of this place has always fascinated me, as I'm convinced that it wasn't a restaurant in its prior life. Perhaps a dance club of some kind, but all of the levels and separate rooms of this place just seem kind of strange, yet charmingly unique, even if the whole décor does seem very dated by today's standards. I asked a server once if he knew what was in the building before Carlos (if any), but he didn't seem to know.

Because of the various seating options, including large tables that accommodate big groups, this place seems to be a very popular spot for large family gatherings.

As for the food itself, I'm actually a big fan of their chimi con queso, recently finding that substituting the chicken out with shredded beef makes it even better. They also offer up some decent enchiladas. Chips and salsa are pretty standard, while their fried ice cream desert isn't the best we've had in compared to places like PoPo's.  

Portions are very generous, food is pretty decent, and service has always been fast. They seem to run a much better operation over here in comparison to the location over on Scottsdale 101, but that's another story for another day. Overall, I don't really feel there's anything that Carlos does that's better or worse than its competitors.

Recommended as a mostly reliable Mexican restaurant on those nights when you can't come to a decision on anything else.
