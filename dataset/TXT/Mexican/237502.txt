Sx4aZlryBbLsjr8eQngEqA At last. An authentic taco joint in Richmond Hill that isn't Taco Bell or a Tex Mex joint. If only this place was open during my time at bayview secondary school, I would be here every day...its directly across it! 

The staff is incredibly friendly and helped me with my food choice. He recommended the cactus tortilla (apparently it's really healthy) and I got three tacos with carnitas, chorizo, and carne enchilada. I had the works in it with a side of guacamole for an extra $1.99. 

They included a few tortilla chips with your meal and those were excellent. The tacos taste authentic but as previous reviews noted, I wish the flavors were more intense. The salsa verde had barely any heat in it so I will be getting a hotter sauce next time. All in all, I will be returning if I need my Mexican fix since LA and Florida are too far to visit for lunch sometimes ;). 

PS: they have bottled coke but not Mexican coke. Boo.
