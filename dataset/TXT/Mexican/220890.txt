rjlAUHT8B6KhKAmkZqS1xw Excellent food and atmosphere! We went for Sunday Brunch and my hubby got the. Real fast burrito and said it was one of the best he has ever had. I had AMAZING posole and my son, who has eaten carne Assad EVERYWHERE said it was excellent. The chips  and salsa trio were very good also. 
We will go back for the happy hour! Parking is not great but there is a lot about half a block east of the restaurant with plenty of space. 
They hit a homer in with the decor too. Just beautiful and I could sit on the patio all day!
