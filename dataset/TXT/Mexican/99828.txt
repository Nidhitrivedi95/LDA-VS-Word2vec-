eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg Good food, beautiful, historical setting. Way overpriced. Although I really really appreciate the back story and my mother's positive reviews, I honestly don't see this as anything exceptional foodwise in the Valley of the Sun except for the story behind it. Yes, I would go here again, but not for the food. Sorry.
