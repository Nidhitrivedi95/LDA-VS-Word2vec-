3te8dGIvzz5V5_kMIr6-Dg I've been here twice now.  Both times I had the black bean burrito with guacamole.  

Twice because I really like their burritos.  I can taste it's not canned beans, so it tastes fresh to me.  I think it was $8 or 9.50 with guacamole.  Yes a bit pricey but I think the quality is there.

So I'll be back when I want some lunch.
