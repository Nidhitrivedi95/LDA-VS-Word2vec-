OMEbwr0Aybw_wnqvno-6zQ Sad to say this place is hit or miss. Sometimes you get a good sever and decent food, others ( and more often)  it's an apathetic server or snarky bartender who can't mix a drink to save their life and subpar food. 

You guys are gonna have to do better if you want to compete with everything else opening in this area. Start by teaching your staff to care and then teach the bartenders to be welcoming and learn how to make a margarita. 

We ordered top shelf liquor (tres generaciones añejo and don julio silver, respectively, both with grand marnier) and they will remain on the table when we leave due to the bartender mixing sooooo much sweet n sour in them. Just gross. Oh, and we caught attitude from the twat mixing them because it was a half hour before closing and she wanted to socialize with her coworkers vs waiting on customers. Smh
