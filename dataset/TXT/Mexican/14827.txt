1-EjdZhVZFuNG6ReBS0rvQ My husband and I have always had a pleasant experience here. 99¢ Margaritas during their Happy Hours and their fajitas were delicious. Chips and salsa are always delicious too. The only thing I would give as feedback to the staff is to take orders a little better and more frequently - I ordered a frozen margarita, got an iced margarita and I wanted to get more than one but by the time the waiter came back to our table to check on us my husband and I were ready to go. Other than that I really enjoy coming here.
