591UZJIUNgPwxXRvQMIUkw I LOVE me some chipotle & probably eat it at least once a week. Kinda addicted :/ This particular location is HORRIBLE. I normally come to this location because its the closest to my work. Sometimes i just go there and stand in line to get my food and sometimes i print the fax form and fax the order in so my food is ready when i get there. Welp...faxed my order, received  confirmation that it was sent successfully & get there 30 minutes later and they dont have my order. The young lady says to me...just because it says the fax was sent successfully  doesnt mean we printed the order. Totally threw me off. Even worst part is she had the nerve  to say you will have to stand in line to get your ordet completed (loooong line might i add). Didnt offer to make my one bowl for me or anything. She was very rude, careless & unprofessional. Problem is the people/staff at this location dont care because  ot literally the only chipotle in the area and they re always slammed busy. Boooooo to this location!
