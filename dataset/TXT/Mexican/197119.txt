OxSaGGTmIujsjDpDqwyGPQ This is one of my absolute favorite spots for Mexican. We have eaten here countless times and the food is consistently excellent. The Sopa Cancun is incredibly flavorful with a tomato-based broth, loaded w/chicken, slices of fresh avocado, cheese and tomato. 
The salsas that accompany the complimentary tortilla chips are bursting w/flavor. They give three different kinds of salsa...mild, med., hot & spicy. 
I highly recommend the enchiladas as you get two, your choice of meet, topped w/the sauce(s) of your choice. The Mole is sweet and quite an interesting choice! Why not try something new?! 
The service too is always friendly and helpful!
