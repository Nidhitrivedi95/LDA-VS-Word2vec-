DaVTuhzi6EgWStb2eAjNjA I will start by saying the service here was phenomenal. If your in a 5 star restaurant you usually will not receive this kind of service. That in itself sets this restaurant aside from others. Now the food. My husband had the chilaquiles and they were delicious. I went with there chorizo plate and that was just as good. I am excited to go back and try all the other plates.

Update: I previously gave this restaurant five stars due to their exceptional customer service however we returned back to this restaurant and unfortunately had the opposite experience.  the food was still very good but I have to take away a star because apparently the high level of customer service does not appear to be there standard we just got lucky with our server
