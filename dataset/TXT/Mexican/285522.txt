y3RlbCN0UrDdLnjSF9NkXA Although their food is normally great, the owner's customer service skills are pitiful! Of course I know they just expanded and are probably still feeling the growing pains but it is not the first time she's had the ability to irritate everyone at the table.  

Last night, we had a group of 11 and the food delivery was much slower than normal, this included getting pitchers of margaritas. Half of our table was ready to walk out. We then asked for separate checks and she made it very clear that wasn't going to happen.  When asked why by one of our group, her comment was that she is the owner and can do whatever she wants.  

Not sure if many of us will be back and that's too bad! We all live close by.
