VRwT0pscR5vESCrAnUpNwQ Gord and I had an early supper at Wilbur Mexicana.  It's been open for a while and it's the first time we've been there.

You order and pay at the counter and they bring it to you.  Gord had a Shrimp & Shrooms Quesadilla.  He said it was good.  He said he wouldn't get it again, though, because it was too drippy and messy.  Plus the verde salsa was overpowering.  I had a burrito with chicken (minus the guac and lettuce).  I love burritos and it was a good one.  I'd get it again.

One thing that was odd was they brought Gord's quesadillo out and then my burrito about five minutes later rather than bringing them out together.  So he started without me rather letting his food get cold.

We'll be back!
