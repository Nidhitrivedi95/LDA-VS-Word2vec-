jWHr_b19C1SjRvfI9jbdmQ I come here quite often and get the tacos all pastor and Carne asada tacos... honestly,  I prefer to eat the meat out of the tortillas because it's tasty.  I feel like the tortillas take away from the flavor as a whole.  The asada and pastor are the best! I didn't care for the barbacoa taco.
