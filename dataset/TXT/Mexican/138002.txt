Iw9k29FJCZ0fC68oxK1NtA Taco Tonto's has some of the tastiest food in town.  I am a loyal chipotle fan, and the first month I was in kent I ate here probably at least 5 times.  They have different specials every day and they're always FANTASTIC.  Their meat is savory, their rice is tasty, and someone in the kitchen knows how to spice properly - it's not all about Tabasco sauce for once.

I still eat at chipotle, their taste combos are too fantastic for me to just ignore, but if you want to spice things up a bit (xD) give these guys a try. :)
