C2BR0TjNacoNzItPLUHTAA I went here for my first time and didn't know it was there. I walked in and could feel the island vibes. I stepped up to the counter and explained to the person taking my order that I had never been before, so he kindly went over what came with the 2 dishes I was considering. I went with the fish tacos and my oh my were they delicious! It was super filling! The staff is great the customers were beautiful and the beer was ice cold. I will be visiting here again to continue eating great good. I hope everyone tries this place at least once! This place should be in more cities!
