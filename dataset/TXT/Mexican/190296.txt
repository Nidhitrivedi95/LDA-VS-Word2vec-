oDxvrLYe5SiQKdJlGhheoA Sat at the bar at 9:00 pm tonight (Sunday in the summer)  After waiting about 8 minutes, I was finally asked if I wanted anything.  I ordered a beer and asked for a menu...my intention was to order dinner.  I was served the beer (with about 3 inches of foam) and handed a menu.  Then I sat there for 15 minutes while I was totally ignored by the bartenders. I couldn't get them to make eye contact.  Finally, I left the money for the beer under the still half-full glass and walked out.  I only live a little over a mile away and have been there before, but promise I'll never go back.
