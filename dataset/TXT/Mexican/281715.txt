XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg I am a sucker for great food, and who isn't? But a was a little worried that Mesa Grill could be one of those "just marketing" or "just name" kind of restaurants, as Bobby Flay owns this. That was not the case.

Mesa Grill delivers the goods. Located in Ceasar's Palace, it does look a little unassuming from the outside, but once you go inside, you get the full perspective, sections and layers of levels make the most of the somewhat limited space. I strongly suggest you make reservations first.

The service is quite good, with a very knowledgeable waiter, who knows the menu by heart and can guide you and help you make the right decision. 

We started off with the Yucatan Chicken Tacos, the rough cut Tuna Nachos, the Tiger Shrimp with the Roasted Corn Tamale, and a Crab Cake. They were all good, but the Tuna Nachos and the Tiger Shrimp were just superb.

Our waiter told us that there are two dishes that made this restaurant famous, the Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin and the Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon. My friends ordered the Black Angus New York Strip Steak and I ordered the Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. My dish has to be one of the top 10 dishes I've had, period. You would not believe this was pork if they didn't tell you, it was tender and juicy, cooked just right.

We ate so much that we couldn't finish our dishes even though we tried to.

I must say, that this place is on the pricier side, but this is Vegas, and this was a memorable meal.

Make Mesa Grill a stop on your next Vegas trip.
