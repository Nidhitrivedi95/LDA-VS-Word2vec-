4vm2W7J_ztH0vcX4bKfuXw Came in to try the place since it's new.  My girlfriend ordered carne asada fries and I ordered some different varieties of tacos. The taco meats were tender and good but for me it needed a bit more salt which was easy fix. The carne asada fries is to die for, the fries was double fried with flour and it's crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside, the toppings were really good which complemented the fries. I've had carne asada fries from a lot of places like robertos, tacos el gordo, and even high yelp review score, jefe's tacos. For me the carne asada fries was the highlight of my visit here even though my girlfriend only shared me some. Great food, good service and good price.
