B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA I was craving this place cause the first time i ate here i was like wow. It was really good.
Today i was very disappointed. We bought 2 sushi buritto. Both with spicy tuna. It was way to salty. I'm in the culinary industry and consistency in taste n texture is important. I dont think I'll come back here.
