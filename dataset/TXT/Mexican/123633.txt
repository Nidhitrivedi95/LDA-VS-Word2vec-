HkbNItNrnXlNo59M0YyoMg Lunch break on a Sunday.  Labor Day weekend. Hardly anybody there. I order salt and pepper wings. First they were extremely salty and second when I bit into one it was mushy. It looked raw. I mentioned it to the waitress that it looked strange and all she said was it was special and then she walked away without looking at it.
