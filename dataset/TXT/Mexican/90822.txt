dXoeLzpG72P7F2Lwa01riQ This Chipotle is always very busy. I usually order online and pick up my food; they always seem to forget SOMETHING in my order. I understand that it's busy, but when you have the order right in front of you on the screen, how hard is it to double check that what you have placed in the bag is accurate?
