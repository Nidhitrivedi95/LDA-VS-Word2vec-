ODjmz6khn1wsa1palLOmmA Service was very polite, but distracted.  The only seafood option at Taco "del Mar" was "Alaskan fish" which turned out to be 2 tiny frozen, breaded fish sticks that were microwaved (yes... MICROWAVED!!!) and placed atop my Cabo Salad.  The "cilantro ranch" dressing tasted like 1000 Island with something spicy added to it, and there was little else to the salad.  It was arguably the worst food I've ever been served in a restaurant.  Unbelievable waste of 7 bucks.  I have never left a negative review before, as I believe in giving compliments when deserved and forgiving mistakes, but this was really that bad.  Duty to warn...
