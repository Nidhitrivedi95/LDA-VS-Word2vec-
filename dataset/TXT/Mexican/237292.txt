SWDxTrwU_qlEcJp36IYquw I'm from Florida so I'm used to having Cuban sandwiches everywhere but now that I've moved to Phoenix I've been looking for a good Cuban restaurant that would have what I'm looking for. And I've found it!  I've had their media noche and it was delicious! Can't wait to go back for the oxtails.
