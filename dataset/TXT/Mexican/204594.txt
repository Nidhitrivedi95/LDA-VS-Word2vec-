PubwGsZPO2N7QBekieMe9w Really pains me to give this place such a low rating because I came back here to give this place another try after having had a bad experience once before with their food. This time the food was some of the best Mexican food I've had in quite a while, but the service was absolutely unacceptable.
If I had to rate this restaurant on the food alone, then it'd get a four star rating, but when it came to ambiance, it gets a negative five star rating, so I'm balancing it out to an overall rating of a one star.
I have NEVER felt so unwelcome in a restaurant in my life. Our waiter was completely uninterested in his job, us, or being here. We saw him three times, when he HAD to take our order, when he HAD to get me a refill on my drink (which is when I had to find him and flag him down) and when he HAD to give us our bill. I'm not kidding about this, he never stopped by our table to ask us how our food was; he never stopped by to ask us if we needed refills on our drinks, and worse yet, we had to get up, get our coats and scarves on and walk towards the door in order to get him to give us our bill.
Such a shame, because I really enjoyed their food, but I an guarantee you, if you're going to treat me like you are so uninterested in me and my hard earned money, then I am NOT going to spend in your restaurant, no matter how good your food is, because in my opinion, half the experience is how you're treated.
