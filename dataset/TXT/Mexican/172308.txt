mB_cI1tCrNxxvr2e2myNrQ My first experience at Taco Bell Cantina was everything I could ask for.

It's got the same great food any other Taco Bell has. It had been a long time since I had Taco Bell and my time here reminded me how great it is. Come here expecting Taco Bell food and you won't be disappointed.

They have hard alcohol, beer, and some sugary frozen drinks. We got some shots of Tito's to keep our buzz going. Niiiice.

It's right on the strip with party music blasting. Taco Bell, alcohol, and good vibes 24/7? Yes please. Perfect setting for a great time. 

If you want some quick junk food while you're in the area I definitely recommend stopping by.
