frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A I came here expecting yummy food after a long flight from Miami and I was so disappointed! First of all, let me start by saying this is not a $ sign place, I would say more like $$. We ordered an horchata, which was pretty good (but then again I've never had one before so... no comparison there). We ordered the mix and match tacos and all I can say is I don't ever want to try mexican food again. I'm cuban, so I know about flavor and good hispanic cooking, but these were not blah! There was no flavor, out of the 3 mini tacos I ordered the only one with SOME flavor was a chicken one that was loaded with onions and spicy sauce. So you can guess, it simply tasted spicy. Overall, if you find another place with good reviews go there. I thought this place would be great due to the 1000+ reviews and the 4.5 rating, but I was greatly disappointed and ended up paying $40 for 6 mediocre, small tacos and a drink!
