JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg Upon our arrival to el dorado I was a little nervous as it is right next to a strip club. As we ventured into this gem, I was pleasantly surprised! The decor is very hip, modern and clean. The menu is full of organic food. The raspberry margarita was so refreshing and tasty! Table side guacamole was phenomenal! The seafood enchiladas were to die for! Our server, amber, was so attentive and professional! We never had to ask for anything! The flan is incredible! I ended up ordering two for our group so that I could have my own. The raspberry margarita was so refreshing! Highly recommend!
