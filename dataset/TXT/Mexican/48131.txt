89uU51kOiQXbJHVA3C6XMQ The real deal!  Very budget-friendly.  Best tortillas I've ever had!  How do such large, thin tortillas stay so strong yet tender?
Ate here for lunch immediately upon our arrival at PHX airport and again for breakfast the next morning.  Portions are plenty big but not overwhelming.  Huge menu to choose from, and everything is very reasonably-priced.
On both visits there were all kinds of customers: locals who lived and/or worked nearby; locals who probably drove in from a ways; people walking out with huge take-out orders for multiple people; and plenty of tourists like us.  
Located just a few blocks from PHX, if you have a long enough layover and a strong enough hankering you just might be able to get there and back to the airport in time.  Definitely try Carolina's if you get to Phoenix.
