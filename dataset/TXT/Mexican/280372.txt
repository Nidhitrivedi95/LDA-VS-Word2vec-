xWq3LQw8w4OIK-fSiGwNLg Well, I hate it when I have to go back to change a review, but I'm unable to leave this as a 5 star. It's been going steadily downhill for the past four months. Today was the worst. 
I'd been talking this place up to friends and family since they opened. Today y Dad said he was in the mood for a good cheeseburger and wanted to try Fat Boy.
I placed the order to go, two cheeseburgers and two fries to go at 10:50. There was a table of 4 ahead of me.  At 11:20 my order was ready, before the family of four got their food!
Took lunch to my Dad. 
1. Burger bun was stale and hard
2. Burger was dry
3. No dressing of any kind
4. Fries were cold 
I was embarrassed I had talked about this place and had my Dad excited for a great burger. We didn't finish it, that bad.
Not sure what happened to this place, but quality of food and service is gone.
