We had a group if 10, and although there was a bit of a wait (as expected with a large group), the food was piping hot. 

Their menu has most things you could ask for in a Mexican restaurant. Maybe too many things, which is why I believe there is such diverse reviews for this place as far as taste goes.

I personally got the green chili chimichanga, which was very delicious. The rice and beans went from just ok, to pretty good if you mix some of the chimi toppings and salsa into it. 

Our server was polite enough, but we weren't offered more to drink until we asked. Not a huge deal though.

A stretch from 'Fine Dining', and nothing to write home about, but I would still come back for lunch in the future.
