sPPh1LJllyr5jUpKFTxxag I went to this local, family-owned restaurant last week and ordered the Asada box with Carne Asada (steak), black beans, sour cream, grilled onions and jalapeno plus nachos and guacamole.  

The steak was cooked well (other places tend to over cook and dry it out), and went very well with the black beans and sour cream.  The grilled onions and jalapenos had a definite kick to them which I thoroughly enjoyed, eating them on their own.  And the guacomole was FRESH!  Went super well with the  nachos.  You won't get that in the chains.  

Another differentiator from the chains is that Asada has Coca Cola from Mexico which is made with sugar cane instead of the crappy corn syrup fructose.  There is a notable difference in taste.  Took me back to my childhood.

My boyfriend ordered the 3 tacos with Chorizos and mexican rice, plus grilled onions and jalapeno, guacomole and nachos.  He inhaled the tacos and raved over the Chorizos, which like all the meats served in the restaurant are hormone free.  

The owner of the restaurant has a nice word to say to everyone who comes in and the staff, composed of family members and regular staff, is efficient, knowledgeable and very friendly. 

Another attractive thing about this place is the decor.  The live wood bar along the wall, the tables, the lighting and the wonderful wall decorations like the pop bottles lined up against the wall and the intricately designed wood Aztec calendar all combine to give the restaurant both a uniquely Mexican flavour along with a local, friendly neighbourhood feel.  

This place is the real deal.  I highly recommend it.
