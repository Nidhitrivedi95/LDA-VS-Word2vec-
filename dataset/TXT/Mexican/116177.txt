From the margarita flight then dish to dish.. it was all just totally unimpressive. the worst of all was the mole bistec that tasted like they burnt every ingredient they could then burned the pan and poured the remnants (mole sauce) on top of a good looking steak. I can't believe they pass this off as a dish, literally spit it out as it entered my mouth.
