g-aAe8SqZlZTnN3oA8mNlw Worst Del Taco in the chain of a great restaurant. I love Del Taco and have been a fan for a long time but this location needs some work and also some new management. I went there Tuesday to have great meal before the Thanksgiving holiday and went home with Food Poisoning. It ruined my Thanksgiving and when I called and spoke to the Male Manager R... he really didn't care and acted like there is no way that their Del Taco (attached to a gas station) could have done that. 

I have called the health department and informed them of this issue. Upper management needs to offer the current management training on how to deal with customers and not act pompous towards customers with a complaint. This manager in particular probably needs a new job as he feels like he owns the place. He is lousy at customer service. 

Never going back to this location! Still love Del Taco but beware of this location, bad attitude and bad food.
