0ydy2fdDg6kpGy1dbnHYsQ We purchased a Yelp deal and it's rare for us, as locals, to eat near the strip (unless family is in town; which seems like every week!).  

We were there on a Wednesday night and arrived just after 7pm.  We were there for over an hour, but were the only people in the whole restaurant the entire time.  As everyone knows, being alone in a restaurant for over an hour is a little awkward but, thankfully, the service was fantastic.

The food was good too, and prompt.  

The restaurant is divided between bar and restaurant and that makes for the non-smokers/eaters to feel segregated away from the action in the bar.  Then again, there was no action in the bar anyway!
