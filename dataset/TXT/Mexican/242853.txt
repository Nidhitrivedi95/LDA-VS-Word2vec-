TH_Vr8_LCnAXFDUqSkF-HA I used to go there on a regular basis with friends.  Hadn't been there in years and went to eat on Wednesday night.  I ordered an enchilada, rice and chicken flauta.  The enchilada sauce was really salty, the rice was greasy and garlicy and the rolled flauta took the shape of an ice cream cone.  All was disgusting.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.
