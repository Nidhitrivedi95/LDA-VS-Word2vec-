lVfZ2AaYRYHCFenUMQna8g If you like overpriced food then this is your place!!!  And don't expect a breakfast burrito at breakfast time because I have been by twice at 8:30am and even though the door says they open at 8, its not true.  The 3rd time I came was the last time for me.  $6 and change for a bean and egg burrito is absurd.
