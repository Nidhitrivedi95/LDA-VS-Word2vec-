Wc9UpJhOcdSj7olZkz7SJA Wonderful food and great staff!! An employee that we assumed to be just your regular employee stopped by to ask if we needed refills on our drinks. When we seemed surprised and appreciative, he asked if we had been there before. We said no this was our first time but we'd heard great things. He thanked us for coming in and said he hoped our experience was going well. When we were almost done with our food, he came back by with a shake for each of my girls and again thanked us for coming in.

The shakes were amazing! Banana and Dulce de Leche.

He turned out to be the owner who obviously takes pride in his restaurant and the patrons that choose to eat there. We left very happy and very impressed with the entire experience!
