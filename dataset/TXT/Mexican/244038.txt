thLX_k20SPJ0KyusGTBIHw Being Hispanic makes you weary of any restaurant that serves Mexican food, but Diego Pops served up a plate full of deliciousness! 
I ordered the green chili taco, steak taco, bacon poblano street corn and a pitcher of sangria (to share with a friend). Everything was good except I wish the corn had more cheese and mayo throughout the entire corn. 

The restaurant is super cute and I am a little obsessed with all of the decor. They even brought the cuteness to the bathroom with quotes that read "Hola Bonita" I will be going back again to try more options on the menu. Brownie point or should I say Pan Dulce points for staying open late!
