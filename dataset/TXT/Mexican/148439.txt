jScBTQtdAt-8RshaiBEHgw Yelp reviewers have this place right. Being a restaurant manager, I was surprised how phenomenal the food was. Chef touches tables making sure guests are enjoying which is rare to see in Vegas. He came to my table and took time to ask about my experience. He has passion and I can definitely taste the Passion behind the dishes. Great local discovery. Awesome service. I will be back for sure. Must try the salmon curry dish, on point and delicious.
