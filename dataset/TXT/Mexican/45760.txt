He was helping an older gentleman in line ahead of me and it was obvious he had never been to one of the other locations let alone this new one and it was apparent on the managers face he was trying his patience. Mind you at the time there were only three others in line. And as someone else who had never been to a hot head this was definitely not the business practice I wanted to see
Second once I began my order I noted the steak looked really dry and was then told that's because it was made in the morning. This seemed to be the only thing the young man behind the counter heard from our conversation as every next step down the line I continually had to repeat myself with the order.  From the looks of it they keep a cart of pre made back up behind the counter as opposed to making fresher items as the demand increases. This became more apparent when I actually got in to eating my burrito. Although the chicken had a good flavor it was incredibly dry. With that said I ordered a barbacoa burrito and a chicken burrito both had a good flavor when you could find the minimal amount of meat that had been scooped in. My chicken burrito became fully rice and beans before the half way point. 
Im hoping this isn't the case for all locations or that these are just some kinks that need to be worked out. We will give it some time then possibly try again. Until then it's tried and true chipotle.
