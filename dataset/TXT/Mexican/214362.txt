QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA Was craving nachos for my last food in Vegas before traveling and decided to check it out. Really cool environment, loved the old school videoclips playing. Ceviche was ok for a Mexican one, but the nachos really made me sad. Ordered a filet mignon Nacho and couldn't eat so spice it was (not stated on the menu) and I really like spice food so I knew it was TOO much. So much tomato paste (in nachos?? Really? ) that I wasn't able to taste the food itself. I only had the meat and the guacamole which was all I could eat and taste properly. If you want nachos I'd suggest you ordering something else.. it sounds delicious but at least mine wasn't.. I complained about it and they didn't charge me the nachos (fair enough since I barely touched it) and got me free dessert which was THE BEST CHURRO ICE CREAM EVER! Really, so so good!! You have to try it! Super fresh and yummy, it's not too sweet as I thought it'd be.

Overall, we had a good service and was happy i didn't have to pay for the food I didn't eat but I had higher expectations for a place that is specialized in nachos..
