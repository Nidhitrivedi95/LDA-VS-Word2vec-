_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g Burrito Boys makes good food.  When my quesadilla and my son's burrrito was being made, it appeared they were skimping on the fillings.  However, when we received our food, it was clear that wasn't the case.

The food was fresh.  The shrimp chunks in the quesadilla could be found in every bite.  I wouldn't purchase extra sauces. A red and a white sauce accompany the quesadilla.  There is a white sauce which has a cilantro lime taste - DEEEEElicious!  It's the perfect match of flavors!

BB lost a star because the staff is ROWDY!  They yell & curse at each other with no regard to customers being present.  The staff is in need of training.
