6Q89zbIFWpjvzD5UWHVgcQ The only thing I liked about this place was their fish tacos (served on corn made soft shells), very flavourful. However, I did find some hard sand like particles in my tacos... It wasn't super pleasant. 

Their ceviches are in the other hand, in my opinion, way too drenched with sauce. We got the passion fruit flavoured mixed ceviches and i felt like I was almost eating passion fruit sauce with a side of ceviche... The sauce was way too overpowering.
