erx8tQ0Wdc5YM0FddaKqKA I tried this place when it first opened and it was amazing. The margaritas were so creative and were so good. They were a little on the pricey side but they were worth it. I ordered the beet tacos and they were amazing! I went back a second and third time but the tacos just didnt live up to the first time. The tortilla were soggy and the beets were not sweet at all. I will definitely give this place another try in the future.
