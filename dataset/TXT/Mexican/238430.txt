SZpzMUdhh1xu2qlegzSyLg I love Mexican restaurants but the margaritas here were absolutely disgusting and the food mediocre. The ice in my margarita was melted when it came, there was no salt, and it tasted like watered down syrup. The service was also really poor. Most of my friends were displeased with their meals. The fajitas were substantial, at the least. But I will not go back.
