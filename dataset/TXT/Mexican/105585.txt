FI7RsrAxVdiDEuSKlYql1w Waited 20 mins for table. Peak dinner time though. 
Queso dip was too thin like water.  Chips n salsa ok. 
Veggies fajitas were pretty soggy, only the zucchini had any grill marks. Cold plate coulda used some cheese or guac. Just lettuce tomato and sour cream. I ordered the lemonade and it was Pink lemonade.. they should edit their menu. Server was great.  I'd look elsewhere for Mexican next time.
