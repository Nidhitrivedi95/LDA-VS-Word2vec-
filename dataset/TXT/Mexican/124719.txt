HQObn6hrV9WoeFObGfa2YQ We have been going here since they opened.  Food is EXCELLENT. They didn't have fountain drinks at first, but have added them. They are very customer friendly. We have been going about once a week now as we love it so much. It seems word is out how excellent they are, as they seem to always have a line now!  

Only two downsides - they don't post their hours, and they don't have much room for the line of people.
