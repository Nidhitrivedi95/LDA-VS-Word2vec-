Zr4VFz5dRVlc8dbn2JjNww Very authentic and delicious. Everyone there is always very hospitable.  It has become our "go-to" Mexican joint and we recommend it to all of our friends. In addition, if you shop at the Giant Eagle nearby the plaza they offer a coupon on the back of your receipt. I usually get the burrito fajita with shrimp and steak because it's fantastic, but their specials have yet to fail me as well.
