sAu9UJ5tvY6sc9Q_gcVV7Q Worst. Customer. Service. EVER. 

I was supposed to meet my family here after my son's high school graduation.  By the time I got out of the parking lot it was 9:30, and I called to say I was on my way.  Even though the sign on the door says open until 10:00, the manager informed my party that they were locking the doors in 5 minutes and I would not be allowed to enter. 

So thanks La Parilla Suiza for ruining my son's graduation dinner. The quality of the food is irrelevant when you treat customers like crap. This is the second negative customer service interaction I have had with them.  Will not be giving them any more of our business.
