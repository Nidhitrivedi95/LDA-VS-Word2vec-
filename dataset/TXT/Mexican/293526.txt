YYE0C8FeDpB6zqB0kSEh7w Decided to see what the stars are all about. Clean, nice decor. The menu looked amazing... Unfortunately the food was bland and not saucy enough. It was spicy, but flavorless. I had to add salt to everything. My son only ate the lettuce. Sad. Portions are small compared to other Mexican restaurants. We will not be returning.
