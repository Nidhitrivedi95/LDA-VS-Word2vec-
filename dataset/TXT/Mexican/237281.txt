We had:

Mexican street corn
Chicken Taco
Beef Taco
Carnita Taco
Margaritas

The corn is served as a starter and it's grilled on the cob with some Mexican cheese and spices---I loved the cayenne on the corn it really gave is a nice kick. If you've neverhad Mexican style corn on the cob you should try it! 

The chicken taco was made with breaded/crunchy chicken and was tender on the inside. It was unexpected that it would be crunchy but it was delicious. 

The beef taco was my favorite! The jalapeno made it pretty spicey and I loved it! It was juicy, flavorful, and fresh. It was one of those situations where you feel like you can't eat it fast enough because it tastes so good. I think I blacked out and then the taco was gone.

Margaritas were great too! Usually they are too sweet and taste like margarita mix but this tasted more like a freshly made one and was not very sweet

I am looking forward to coming back here for sure
