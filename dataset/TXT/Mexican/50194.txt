8U8B2E4F7u53fkfpqkCIWw F O O D  P O I S O N I N G  A L E R T !!!Went to this taco bell on Fri Feb. 17th 2017 and ordered a few tacos and a naked chicken. All of a sudden on Sat. I had a fever and heart palpitations with severe diarrhea. Called 911 and was taken to the hospital. They said I had a virus and sent me home. For the next 4 days I was violently ill with a 103° fever and diarrhea every 15 minutes and on Thursday I started passing a lot of blood. Was rushed back to the hospital and after some testing they said it was food poisoning. Aside from some rice I made for myself on Sat the 18th the food from this Taco Bell is the only other food I had. Every time I go there late night there is either a ride employee or they get my order completely wrong. Now I have food poisoning to add to the list NEVER EATING HERE AGAIN!
