-YBC5pR2eW0C2sPygH25MA Frequent this location often and never have an issue. 
The service is fast, food is hot and people are friendly. 
I miss the military discount tho! This is a BIG military/police location, they should give back to those (just sayin).
Bathroom is clean. 
Even tho lunch time is their busiest, the line moves fast.
