MAuSh7NKoT__CQ4BumoayA My first time at T&T.... the chips were definitely the best part of.  They were so fresh, warm and crunchy.  The salsa's for being from a restaurant were okay.  I had the habanero chicken wings and they were not hot at all, but they were still good. The waitress was friendly but straight to the point. Overall I would recommend this place to hang out and maybe just snack on the chips and salsa.
