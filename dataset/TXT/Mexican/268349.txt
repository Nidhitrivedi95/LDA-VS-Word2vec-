WlBvw6R1Qe2yIaZp-2ilZA The food was slightly above average but the service was terrible. We were waiting for our food to come out for a whole hour, even though we were one of the few customers in the restaurant. Never got our water refilled, yet an automatic 20% gratuity was placed on our bill. Then the waitress tells us that she cannot split our bills because all of their computers are "down", but she can only take payment  from one credit card. Fishy
