5eKk8dA1QtKaQr_5i_SCRw Pittsburgh has NO selection when it comes to Mexican food.  Sorry, Pittsburghers, but Mad Mex is not Mexican.  That said, Las Velas is the best there is to offer.  Chips are delicious.  Guacamole is the best i've had in Pittsburgh.  I do think it's tacky when places charge you for chips, though.

The burritos are HUUUUUGGGEEE!  The hot sauce is tasty but spicy, although I do have a low heat tolerance but next time I would stick with mild.  It was bordering on the "Ow" and "it hurts so good" line.

This place will def get me thru the Mexican food withdrawls while I'm here.  It's a lot pricier than Mexican food should ever be but the owners must know there's no real competition.
