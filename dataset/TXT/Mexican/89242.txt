dQwjYLmQXb06CpMPIpm5-g stopped in tonight for the first time because of previous yelp post. Ordered the guac, I could have had 2 plates, so fresh. Food was great and not doused in sour cream or salsa because they have nothing to hide with quality food. The drive down there sucked, prepare to fall into a pot hole. Terrible roads.
