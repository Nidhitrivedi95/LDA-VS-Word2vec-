iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg Tasty seafood tacos in Kensington for a good price. Stopped by at 6pm on a weeknight and it was thankfully only about 10 minutes to wait, order, and get the food - though the line was already snaking out the door by the time I left. I got the Blackened Mahi Mahi Taco ($5) and it was generous enough that I had to eat some filling before I could fold it up. The fish was fresh, crisp and tender, and I liked the double layer of corn tortillas. This was more than I expected for a snack so I think two tacos would make a good meal. 

The service is fast for what it is, but there wasn't much space to wait for the food. Seating was limited to a table for 4-6 and it was pretty difficult to squeeze in. I can imagine it getting pretty stuffy and crowded during the summer, but I'd love to go back and try the other flavours.
