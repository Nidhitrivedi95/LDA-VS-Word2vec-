H-SO-RdX_umCon5hwRsYww This place is a bar that happens to serve food, plane and simple. It has a good vibe with TVs and nice intimate setting.  

The beans are good with chips and their salsa is good too. 

You can't complain about $1 tacos Tuesday or $1 margaritas on Wednesdays.  

They have 4-5 beers on tap but they just have 2 available every time I go there. 

Extremely slow service and sometimes your waitress is high on Purple Stinky Punch lol.. 

I keep going there cause of the beans and chips/salsa and the boo's
