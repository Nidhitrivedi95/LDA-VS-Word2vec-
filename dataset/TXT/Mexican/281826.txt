XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Came here for brunch since there wasn't a spot in our hotel.

I had the spicy scrambled eggs with jalapeños, goat cheese, and apricot glazed ham. I really liked it but I couldn't really taste any goat cheese. I ordered it with grits and they were amazing. Cheesy, and soft, and packed with flavor. 

The bf got the blue corn waffle. It was also really good but it gets too sweet/soggy after a while. Maybe you can ask for the fruit sauce on the side.. 

The cactus pear iced tea was not as good as I expected it to be. I swapped it for OJ instead and was much better. The iced tea has a subtle pear flavor.. I'd like a fruitier version instead. 

Service was great but it was annoying to hear our server constantly being told to work faster to get people out. Her superior kept asking her what was going on with certain tables. Some people just take a while to order and I don't think it was right for her to be scolded for not having their orders in yet. 

Overall an okay experience. With so many open tables it's weird that there was a wait for one.
