Besides the amazing service, another thing that gives this place the advantage of being 5 stars, is simply the Location and view of the whole place, in the Venetian Next to the water & gondola, with italian Fences, and an adorable flower on the table. This place gives you an amazing feel under the Beautiful Fake sky that makes Las Vegas so amazing! 

My drink was amazing, & the food was excellent! This is Mexican food by the way, served in a very fancy way. I loved that they have flan. Yummyyy!!
 I will defenetly come here again forshure. I recommend cañonitas to everyone. Its a MUST come if youre out here in Las Vegas.
