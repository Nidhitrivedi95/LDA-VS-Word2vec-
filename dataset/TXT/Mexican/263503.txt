We ordered chip and guacamole appetizers, and then ordered a variety of items. Steak tacos, tamales, enchiladas and burritos.  However the rice and beans are extra if you want a meal.  We didn't know that until the bill came. Might have been an oversight, because of the large group. Everyone was happy with what they ordered.
