kYvZZ_aKaKLQKeyms74T2Q This was the best Mexican food I've had in years! The homemade flour tortillas are to die for and I love that all dishes come with Fideo soup to start. 
I usually order enchiladas at any Mexican place and decided to try their mole enchiladas with Steak. When my plate arrived I couldn't even find the enchiladas because there was a gigantic piece of well seasoned carne asada on top that was so amazing! Needless to say, portions were huge. We got to-go boxes and it felt like we barely touched our food even though we pigged out. The only disappointment were the churros for dessert which were nothing special, just the typical street fair kind and I suggest that they improve on this. All the Fine Mexican restaurants have home made churros on their menu accompanied with dipping sauces. Not so here. A minor detail, but I'll let it slide and will definitely be back soon!
