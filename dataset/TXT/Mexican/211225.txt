qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A During a recent trip to Las Vegas, we visited DW Bistro again for lunch on a Sunday.  The place was jammed packed, which is always a good sign.  We had eight people in our party making the wait for a table even more challenging.  The person (I think he is one of the owners) who checked us in was so friendly and welcoming that we trusted the fact he said it would not be too long, and he was correct.  DW Bistro has a pretty cool check in system that sends a text indicating your name has been recorded and when your table is ready. 

After being seated, they offer all you can drink mimosas for $20.  After a hectic weekend, we went with pomegranate iced teas, and one person had an amazing Bloody Mary.   The pomegranate iced tea was super refreshing, and the Bloody Mary was exciting.  The Bloody Mary comes with a garnish containing an olive, a pickle, and a piece of bacon...yes a piece of bacon.  There was certainly nothing boring or routine about the Bloody Mary. 

I started off with the Chicken Flautas as an appetizer.  The flautas were spicy enough, and the chicken inside was perfect.  The presentation was equally impressive.  My main course was the Jamaican Jerk Chicken and Waffles with homemade syrup.  Do not be concerned when you see the coating around the chicken.  The coating is dark, thick, but it is so delicious.  The coating is complex and contains several Jamaican spices.  Others in our party went with the Eggs Benedict, and they indicated it was delicious as well.  The item is served on fresh biscuits and a side of potatoes.  In regards to the service, it is clearly five stars! 

If you find yourself in south Las Vegas near Summerlin, you must give DW Bistro a try.  On the other hand, if you need some time away from the strip, drive 15 minutes south and enjoy the unique dishes that DW Bistro has to offer.
