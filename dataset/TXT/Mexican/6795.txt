_hJy4lG6iuWIE95UYHJyiw I visited this place with my daughter who came to visit and was craving Mexican, so based on the reviews we choose Tequila. Wish I hadn't. First thing getting in the server was friendly but flat out admitted that he was new and did not knew the menu so he had to keep going back inside to ask if the items we wanted were available. Then when I asked to be moved to an another table because the AC was to strong and it was bothering me, they actually let my daughter carry the basket of chips and silver ware without offering any help. The dipping salsa was far from original the server admitted that it came from a can and was the only one they serve. When the food came out the enchiladas with green salsa looked like someone had vomited over them.  My daughter refused to eat it, not only for what it looked like but for the tasteless flavor. We know Mexican food, and that was definitely not it. The tostadas with bean and chicken was soggy and you could not tell what was chicken or flour soggy tortillas. .. the steak tacos were too salty and the meat so chewy that it felt plastic. .. finally we gave up and asked for the ticket without being able to eat anything of what was ordered. .. my daughter has refused to try another Mexican food place in town because she thinks every place will be as awful. .. 
Bottom line,  just because you look Mexican and maybe have some Mexican blood in you,  don't assume that you can cook Mexican, it does take real talent, please don't go giving a culture a bad name just because you fancy yourself a Mexican chef.
