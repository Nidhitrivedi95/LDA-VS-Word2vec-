Never had a fresh Gordita before.  Frankly, thought it was some freakish Taco Hell creation.  While I can't comment on authenticity, the green chili chicken gordita with cheese was wonderful.  The freshly made corn tortilla was the best part.

Salsa bar is good, not great, but love the cabbage and pickled onions.  Also had a good carne asada gordita.

Great eats before a movie.
