x2CLU-qw2Hpwu2vSGLEorg I stopped here for lunch and ordered two revueltas pupusas which is a mixture of queso, beans, and chicharron.  I also ordered the horchata and the woman taking my order was nice to point out it was Salvadoran style, not Mexican, which I knew in advance and was OK with.

I took a seat and in about 5 minutes, my pupusas and curitdo were brought to the table.  The pupusas were quite hot and filled with queson.  Good tasting as was the cortido.  I know people pile the coritdo on their pupusas sometimes, but I like them separate for the most past.  I do put some on my fork and then grab a piece of pupusa but that's about it.

Lunch was very pleasant and inexpensive with the pupusas being $1.95 each.  They're also very filling and I walked out with a full stomach and a smile on my face.
