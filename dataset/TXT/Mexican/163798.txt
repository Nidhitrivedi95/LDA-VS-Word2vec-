LGEIsxeJQATo9J1IA-TEdA When you see corn and peas in the mexican rice, you know you're going to have a bad time. Beans and rice were really sad, worse than out of a box/can, not authentic at all. Neither my date nor myself enjoyed our food. The prices were outrageous for the quality. The building and decor looks old and sadly in need of updating. 
We had always seen their sign off the I-17 and finally stopped in to try it out because they were open until 10 on a week night and we needed a later dinner. Will NEVER go back. 
I love salsa but I don't even have anything nice to say about their salsa, it was so run of the mill (at best).
