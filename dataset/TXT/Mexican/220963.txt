rjlAUHT8B6KhKAmkZqS1xw I don't give out five's easily but with terrific service, an amazing outdoor patio area, and food that isn't your typical rice, beans, and gobs of cheese, this Mexican restaurant delights the palate.  My husband loves the five street tacos but from their unique guacamole to an array of medium priced drinks (great deals at happy hour), this place rocks the Sunnyslope.  Their parking lot is a little bit odd--you have to walk from a lot away, but hey, after all the food you eat, walking may be just what's needed!  Please do try their chili rellano's if you want a healthy rendition--not a lot of cheese, but plenty of favorable vegetables wrapped in a hatch chili.  Yum!  I've liked it so much that I've ordered it twice now...
