F2L2f-ITjnHlqKRFQVFsVg My favorite menu item is most definitely the street corn! It's a must. To be fair, I have yet to try any breakfast options but have been to the truck several times. We ordered a pork belly & chorizo burrito - which was very heavy on the beans (too much so) and the meat was a little too chewy for my liking. The staff had a lot of recommendations and was very friendly. We had also ordered a tinga taco and salmon taco. Both were good! All in all, the food was decent but I feel like their breakfast would excel. I'll go back for the street corn any day
