9Jc3W0aR9Xf2gcHI0rEXsw Ordered the ALL YOU CAN EAT BBQ Ribs. Tasty ribs, St. Louis style. However the GOOD STOPS THERE. Of my 3 plates of Ribs 2 were cold and had to be sent back, only to come back dry and burnt. The sides of 1/4 ear of corn, dried out corn bread, and canned tasting bake beans were not worth ordering the the first time, let alone additional
