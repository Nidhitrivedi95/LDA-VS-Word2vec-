m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw This is a hard review for me!  So we break it down into sections.
Arrival:  numerous empty tables but we wait for 15 minutes and others are seated.  We opt to go to the bar.
The bar:  fast service & friendly.  The bar itself is awkward due to the build to eat from. 
The whole evening was frustrating...I am willing to try it again and update the review should things be better on the second round.
