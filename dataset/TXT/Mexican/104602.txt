FGaaHr_krwaPGlD0mHPe4Q This place was attractive and clean. And the service was good.

But the food left so much to be desired. The menu is a bit limited. The chips were not hot, and the two sauces served with the chips were not great - the chunky version was so acidic and it was bitter.

I wanted to eat light my last visit, so I just ordered a cheese crisp. I asked for green onions (scallions) on it, and was told they did not have green onions. They offered white onions instead. What kind of Mexican food place doesn't have green onions in their kitchen?

Underwhelmed!

But they had free wi-fi so I was able to post this two-star review while I was sitting in their dining room!
