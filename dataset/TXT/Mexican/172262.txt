mB_cI1tCrNxxvr2e2myNrQ Taco Bell on the strip is a huge plus. Other than that your franchises across the city does a better job of basic operations . No clear distinct line to order food. Restroom for only one person male /female . Honestly Not worth the hype . Won't be able to handle the amount of business and stress of a typical summer day in vegas .
