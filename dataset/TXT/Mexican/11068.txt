We originally ordered the chicken tacos and carne Asada tacos but our server mistakenly gave us shrimp tacos instead we decided what the hell we'll give them a try and they were even better than the carne tacos. The lines that came with them were also a nice touch. Between the three of us we ordered 6 tacos to share and a side of their homemade tortillas and our tab came to the reasonable amount of $26.
