QDRFdG8gPPKL7r4yic8j7Q I have loved this place since I was in high school, about 7 years ago. It is super delicious and such an easy stop for a fast lunch/dinner or heck even breakfast. The staff are always so nice and welcoming. You can often find the entire phoenix police department stopping in their for lunch as well! Amazing place with good food and service!
