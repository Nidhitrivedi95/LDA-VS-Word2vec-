Hh1I-rRuM1MwpyT0IuvXMw Like a Mexican froyo place (without the froyo) in the West Valley! Choose your size cup, what fruit, vegetables, chips, candy etc. you want and topped with Clamato, homemade chamoy, "super hot sauce", chile and limon. The best part...you don't pay by weight, just cup size and they pack everything in so you get the most possible. They also have raspados (real fresh fruit snow cones topped with ice cream and lechera and whatever else you want) and elotes (Mexican corn).
It's a little hidden gem tucked between a smoke shop and nail salon on 107th and Indian school, northwest corner; check it out sometime!
