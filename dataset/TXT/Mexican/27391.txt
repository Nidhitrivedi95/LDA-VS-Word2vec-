3I4I9C5VN3NIkU1K0Mc01w My husband and I came to have some "us" time. We were roaming around Fremont street. We were not too hungry but wanted something to snack on. Well that was a mistake, we came in here they have excellent, friendly service and the food is GOOD. We wanted more than a snack! We are coming back tomorrow and the next if possible. We ordered tacos and they have a small salsa bar with condiments which allows you to fix up your Taco to your liking! If you don't like onions no problem, if you want a lot of onions no problem. Love it!
