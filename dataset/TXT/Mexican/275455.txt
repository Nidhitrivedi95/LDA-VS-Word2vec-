xDHuJaOQ5HqaLP0zgpJD9w Today. I decided to become a Yelper. Now, I don't want to sound dramatic. And I usually don't ever rate anything. But today I was disappointed. Taco Bell is my favorite, hands down of all fast food. Today I was really craving a XXL Grilled Steak Stuffed Burrito. Now don't let me steer you wrong. I'm not trying to make it sound like I haven't had it in a while. I actually had it last night. But that's my point. I LOVE Taco Bell. I grew up on Taco Bell. 1. Burrito Supreme, soft taco w/ sour cream. 

Well... Today's burrito was just nasty... and I know what a XXL Grilled steak stuffed burrito is suppose to taste like. I loved it so much last night I decided I was going to have it again today for lunch. And it just, did. Not. Hit. The. Spot. The taste was just... off. And overall not appetizing. The sauce was off. It was just the taste of beans bite after bite.... I buy every meal with expectations. Fast food money doesn't grow on trees, so I want every meal to hit the spot. I was expecting greatness when all those flavor combinations hit my tongue. (Cause that's all Taco Bell is. Flavor combos. Lol) But instead I got plain bean burrito. FUN. What a waste of 6 bucks. 

I give it 3 stars, cause I'm still coming back. Perhaps the next location will be better.
