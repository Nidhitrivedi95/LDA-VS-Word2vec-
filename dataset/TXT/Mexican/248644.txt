uBGPTzye3wrxZPf54AXuFg Great location on the lake. Nice contemporary decor and ambiance but that's not the primary reason for coming to a restaurant.

My very simple Casa salad with Chorizo came at least 7 minutes after the rest of my group. I've had larger side salads! The ingredients were fresh and the dressing was tasty but definitely not worth $18. 

To add insult to injury, they actually charged me $1 for 4 pieces of jalapeño pepper I asked for.
