iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg I ordered the gobernador taco and it costed $5 + tax. I know $5 for one taco might seem really expensive, but it's actually very filling and tasty. I only ate one taco but felt very full afterwards so don't worry, you're getting your money's worth. The tacos are a little messy because they really fill them up, so if you can find a table or a bench to eat at that would be best. Otherwise get a fork - you're gonna need it.

Definitely recommend this place if you're in the mood for some tacos but don't know where to go.
