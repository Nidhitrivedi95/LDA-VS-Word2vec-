E_DXCeVllZtHV93hsAIZvw Came here for taco Tuesday for $2 tacos and I really wanted to love this place.  I think my problem was taking the tacos to go.  I ordered 1 carne asada and 2 al pastor.  I didn't love the tortillas at all.  The carne Asada was delicious but for some reason I wasn't loving the al pastor and that's usually my all time favorite!  I ended up only eating 1 taco and the rest I just couldn't. Bummer!
