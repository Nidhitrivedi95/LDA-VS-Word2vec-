qWi9dNGo9D9I4F9RANc-6g Although this restaurant doesn't take reservations, they said they would accommodate our party of 8 for a Saturday because we were a larger group and everyone was traveling out of state for a baby shower. When we go there, they had no record of our reso and were told that we can either wait 45 min. or leave. After the 45 min wait and still no table, the host told us that "everyone else is waiting too, so too bad."  We waited a total of 1 hr and 15 min for a table (with a pregnant woman! ) Left at 11pm. WORST service ever with the WORST attitude from the staff because their employee screwed up. At least the food was good, but not worth a 4 hr dinner!
