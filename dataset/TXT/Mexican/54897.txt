9vub2LM7Djy8P-LPumcLXA I tried the tacos chiwas that had the beef, ham and cheese with hatch green chili sauce and the classic Asada as well as the carnitas tacos. My favorite of course was the chiwas, it was so well balanced not too spicy and the ham was super subtle so it wasn't too salty. It was perfect! I give it a five star. The other tacos were good too but not like the chiwas. Yum.
