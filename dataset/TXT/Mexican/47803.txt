82g1PwX5FvclqqdjJHcVNA My husband and I decided to try this place out on our way home. We have missed our taco spot back home so much and other place weren't cutting it on our side of Vegas so what the heck lets try it. We purchased four Carne asada tacos which came out to $9 and some change (ouch a little pricey). We also waited 15 mins for our order. As we were waiting my husband whispered "Wtf these tacos better be the business." Lol finally we received our food and you know what is was worth it. Best tacos that I've had in Vegas.
