bAdwf-n52f46-ZjlfJ1Hwg We come here almost every Sunday night after church.  The food is delicious.  so far I have had the carnitas and the carne asada here.  The meat is good quality, never fatty.  The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because they charge $0.50 to pay with a credit card.  This is a turn off for a lot of people.  They should have just thought through the menu and charged 3% more per item to recover the credit card fees.  Then no one would know and all would be happier.  Great food and fantastic service.
