It's a line up and order what you want kind of deal, and take your food to a table (either inside or out, they have a small patio) Fast service, reasonable prices, really large portions.  I had beef enchiladas it came with rice and black beans, everything was just so tasty, I ate it all!  I will definitely be back here to try out some of their other dishes.
