Or7FgbgY8ML30zgYj_DCwA Love this Mexican cuisine. Their food portions like a chimichanga is huuuuuge!! I get full every time I come here (even with takeout on the side). I also highly recommend their sides of the Mexican soup and rice. So much unique Mexican flavours brought out but don't order of you aren't a fan of beans! I love love love their drink selections. Though a bit pricey, so worth it. If I could recommend just coming here for drinks, I would! I always tend to order the Mexican bulldog (Mango preferred) which is a margarita with a mini corona bottle feeding into it. If you're not a fan of corona just opt to get their normal margaritas. Huge cups! Great taste! Great destination for birthdays as well. If you're of legal age, they give you a birthday shot, and sing an obnoxious birthday chant that will for sure leave a lasting memory for the celebrant. All in all, great Mexican eatery and experience. Authentic music, vibes and food. Would definitely recommend and keep coming back :)
