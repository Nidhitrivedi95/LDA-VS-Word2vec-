C1p3eAhzX3w8VxsJKH3iXw First off, I love Chipotle. However, this store had the worst service and management I've ever experienced at a chipotle, the people on the line were rude and noncommunitive. After waiting over 45 minutes, the workers were rude and did not care about service. I understand you're busy but really? I'd rather drive all the way downtown before coming back here.
