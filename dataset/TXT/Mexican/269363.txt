woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ I am visiting for Thanksgiving so this was my first time here. They had really good music last night and the drinks were good too. This place has a really great atmosphere and is attached to Butcher & Rye so you can bounce back and forth between both spots. Next time I'll try the tacos!
