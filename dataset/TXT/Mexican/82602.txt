d_L-rfS1vT3JMzgCUGtiow I saw BG listed as #2 as best Sunday brunch place & I have to say the folks at Eater have little experience with LV brunches. Brunch is $40 for all you can eat. It is not a buffet or butler service, it is an order your small plates and wait for 20 minutes and hope you get what you order situation. Service was painfully slow and dishes were forgotten on three different occasions - out of only five chances is too many mistakes. Water and teas were often empty too. Food was decent, but seemed very repetitive. Maybe I'll come back for dinner again, but there are dozens of Sunday brunch options that crush this place.
