eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg Heartbreaking experience. Having dined at two other restaurants under same leadership, our expectations were high. The quality of the food and service was not good, prices very high and the dining room was not clean. We had planned to bring guests here next week and definitely will change that plan. The only positive was the Mexican wine we chose - was quite good.
