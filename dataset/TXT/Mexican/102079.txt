EYWaN9sLjVYdi7fKIRguVA Pulled into the drive-through and had to repeat my order 3 times to a rather rude woman who finally got the order right but the screen wasnt updating from the order prior to mine so I thought I'd just pull around and correct it up at the window.  I wasn't upset or annoyed just wanted my food (I'd been fasting for blood tests). The woman handed me a Pepsi and I corrected her very politely with my original order request of coffee. She then proceeded to very rudely state,  "I asked you if the order was correct on the  screen" and bitch to herself under her breath while she completed the difficult task of pouring a cup of coffee. Some words were exchanged and she threw the Pepsi at my window as I drove away.  I walked in,  requested the manager and they all coward behind the counter.  I'm not sure if she was just having a bad day or what but I will never come back to this location.  There is a Taco Bell just down the street and I will go out of my way to give business there instead.
