cr84hpeFeas6N6VGV7Iu3A Dropped in for the first time on a Thursday night after a long drive and because my husband had a rough day, and Mexican food always cheers him up. Much to his delight, we were pleasantly surprised to find we had come on a night the offered all you can eat enchiladas and 2 dollar Bud and Bud Light.
Everything was so good! The enchiladas were served with your choice of sauces, ranging from mild queso to a spicy roja sauce. You also had a great choice of protein options (chicken, beef, pork, and chorizo.)
Our server was especially nice and very fast; which we both really appreciated. Highly recommend!
