7xmuQuhpzBlkkSbWePFeVQ Holy wow. ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. 

Ambiance was right on for a date night or cozy night out with a group of friends - very warm. 

They serve you three salsas right off the bat: a green w/ avocado & cilantro, a mango habanero, and a spicy tomato (saucy, not chunks). All three were great. And free.

Got the lavender-lime Margarita: very sweet but awesome. Did give me some heartburn and a bit of a stomach ache from the the sweetness, but the flavor was SO good. The boyfriend got blood orange. Too sweet. Also delicious anyway.

Got the negra modelo battered avocado tacos. One of the best things I've ever eaten. I don't say that often. I mean, sure, you'd assume battered avocados are amazing. But where else have you had them? And boyfriend's chile relleno was huge and also great (not as great as mine of course). 

We also got the Mexican salsa & coconut pineapple salsa. Neither were as good as their three standard ones. They were good though. And free. 

Our server was PERFECT. Attentive without being annoying, perfect timing, knowledgeable, nice (not phoney). 

We had a perfect night at Orale and if I'm being honest with myself: I'm pretty picky and ALWAYS find something wrong. I didn't with this place.
