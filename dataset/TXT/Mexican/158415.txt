KpfCj839-MPcxM8FKkW7GA I was a little nervous to come here because of the reviews but I really wanted a taco so I decided to give it a go on my lunch break! Hands down the best Taco Bell experience I have ever had. I didn't not go inside so I don't know what if it's nice/clean in there but the Drive thru was quick and easy! The Drive-thru employee was super funny and accurate with the order! The food was very fresh and still very hot after my 15 minute travel back to the office! 

I mean, I know it's Taco Bell, but if it's delicious, cheap, and hits the spot, what's wrong with writing a review? ;-)

I got the chicken doubledilla combo which is my fave & I added on a crunchy taco. All of the items were fresh and delicious! Definitely give this location a try for lunch!
