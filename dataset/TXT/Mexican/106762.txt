FMo1PJTUV5OpyiZlnTM1Rg Finally we have a Sharky's in Vegas! 
Many of my Cali people talk about this place so I was excited about trying it out and especially after looking over their menu. 
This is the first "chain" restaurant offering organic, natural, and wild caught foods. Major plus for me!

ATMOSPHERE:
Located in the Boca Park area in the same plaza with Whole Foods, when I walked into Sharky's I loved the layout. Lots of seating available, along with a little bar like area although I only saw beer and wine options. Nice TV located at the bar to catch a game while you grab  a bite. 

FOOD: 
The best thing about this place! Went after the gym, so I got the veggie bowl with wild caught salmon added on, and a watermelon basil lemonade to wash it down. Chips are complimentary here, and truly I fell in love once I tried the salsa bar (see my profile I love me some salsa) the avocado and killer hot salsa are amazing! I had to wait maybe 7-10 mins for my food, which if you ask me is a GOOD sign, I like my food made fresh. It arrived piping hot, nice bowl and all brussel sprouts were cooked nicely, as was the quinoa, and the flavor was great not too salty and not bland. My salmon was good as well, had to pour my salsa on it to really take it up a notch. I'll definitely be going back to try the pizza and salads. Love that they have a "low calorie menu" and list nutrional info. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
I was greeted when I walked and staff also said goodnight when I walked out. Also was offered to sign up as a member (which, duh I did) and my food was brought to me. Very friendly and easy going staff. Salsa bar was kinda messy though, probably the only area that needed attention. 

Overall I'll definitely be going back to Sharky's talk about a great first impression. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because of pricing,  but I understand going organic and natural can be pricy. Still, hands down much better than Chipotle for all my gym rats, go to Sharky's if you can.
