CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q Omg! I've heard so much about this place but until now, I've never known the deliciousness that is TACOS EL GORDO. 

Coming from someone who loves her street tacos and eats them once a week or more, these tacos were a winner. 

Each taco is $2.25, a bit on the expensive side, but trust me, they are the best. 

I absolutely loved there asada taco! One of the best I've had. They give a lot of meat on each taco and put on your sauces for you. 

The half adobada and half asada fries were to die for. This was a large portion and the price was decent. 

Parking was a breeze and since this location is off the strip, it wasn't too crowded when we went.
