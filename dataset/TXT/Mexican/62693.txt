I had a beer, then another... they beers are tasty and one might think that is what matters right? So I have kept coming back to this place, some days there are quite the clientele and it is a very heterogeneous crowd too which appeases me. 

But their brown fall brew is amazing. I have come back just for this on a stressful day at work. Just to sit back, have a really good beer can make the difference some times. 
The atmosphere is partially standard bar, but it has some space. It isn't big but big enough. I feel that if this becomes the standard in the valley, Phoenix will rise again.
