DXCho3TSX6qKsRoEjGoGJg I've been coming here for over 10 years so should write a review I reckon. I've never had anything here that wasn't good. Also features great priced lunch specials as well as great service and a great environment. After you eat enjoy a nice walk around the lake and feed the geese.
