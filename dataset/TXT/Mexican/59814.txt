AI7zxDNVgO3pDyAP_rcA7A It's Chipotle.  For the most part, if you've been to one, you've been to them all.  I don't mind Chipotle, in general, but it's probably not my favorite.  It will totally do in a pinch though.  We've had a variety of menu items here and they've all been good enough. I generally trend towards the bowls to try and keep the carbs/calories down.  The burritos are tasty too. Service is fast and efficient enough, especially since this place gets jam packed.
