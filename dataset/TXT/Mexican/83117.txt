D3MfMrIoNV4_aXPj0bi1BQ So I thought this place was just okay.
The food didn't wow me. 
I was told amazing things. 
The guacamole with the goat cheese was def good. We did the trio. The lobster guac, I wasn't too impressed with.
I ordered the fish as the main entree!
Now that was pretty good.
No room for dessert but the watermelon margarita may have been my favorite of the whole dinner!
