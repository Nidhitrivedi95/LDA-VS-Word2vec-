Great selection of food. 

Friendly staff. Like I mean very friendly. I wish more places were like that. 

Can't wait to try the corn when it's in season. 

The drive through is a little slow but I think it's cause it's not your typical "fast food"

We love that this place is close to our house!!! 

We will be back!!!
