kW1BF6G5kAvVGtQR0ljM8g Just came from there. I went through drive through placed my order with a large Baja blast. I take a sip before i leave the parking lot, and it's watered down so, I go back having to wait again two cars are in front of me. I get the the window and she asks  me what other drink I want without explaining. I said why "she said she doesn't know why it's not working the back is full" I just think she was to lazy to replace the box. Anyway I said I don't want anything just my money back. She seemed annoyed gave me my money with no apology or good bye...I won't be going there anymore with that type of service.
