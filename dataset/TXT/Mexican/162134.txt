l1GJnB9TJgGgEeI4at1M0A Coming from San Diego, I'm used to good Mexican food. By FAR some of the BEST Mexican food I've ever heard including traveling through Mexico. Mahi mahi and shrimp tacos are to die for. The carne asada quesadilla bar none amazing! 

I never write Yelp reviews but I felt this meal was worth it. Little hole in the wall feel but OMG soooo good
