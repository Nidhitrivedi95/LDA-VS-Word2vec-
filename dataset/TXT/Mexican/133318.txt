iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg Went to kensington twice this week just to try this place during the coldest days of winter. It was def worth it.

I had the carnita and mahi mahi. Both were good and very filling. Lots of flavour in the tacos and lots of fresh ingredients. Having had tacos from grand electric, Buster's sea Cove's fish taco and gourmet gringos, I have to say their mahi mahi wasn't the best i've had. But the Carnita was great and a steal at $3. 

The place was quit difficult to find. It's a great hidden gem.
