GC5wcui5uejRZTi8OCNPkQ We dine her several times per year. Our most recent was on Cinco De Mayo. Outstanding staff, great Margaritas, incredible food. Large portions and the freshest tortilla chips I've ever had. There is a bar with gaming. The bartenders are the best! I had a burrito. It was large and delicious. We also had ceviche, which was also outstanding. My wife had tacos and loved them. This a hidden gem inside the Silverton Hotel, off the STRIP.
