MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA Grand Electric was a pioneer of sorts in the taco scene in Toronto. After several years now, it is still going strong.

I stopped in recently for a late afternoon pre-dinner dinner of tacos and drinks.

The tacos are very good. I tried a few. The pork belly, while flavourful and tasty, was bested a bit by the seemingly ubiquitous shrimp taco, which was not the least bit rubbery or over cooked.

A visit here in the late afternoon in summer is a great idea. Crowds are lighter, and you can snag a seat (with some luck) on the quaint patio without a reservation. 

Cocktails lack flair, yet are good. Plenty of can and bottle beers available as well.

Service at the patio is surprisingly attentive and on point. The hip, casual staff are on top of their game.

I have had greater "wow" experiences elsewhere, yet a nice drink, delicious taco and good service on a sunny afternoon here is a delight.
