AZveQUZIFuMJWrqmrhqQ4g Unimpressed. Looking for place to grab dinner to take home. Saw this on Yelp. Looks nice inside, nice seating area with pastry and ice cream in glass presentations cabinets. Went to order. Young lady barely could speak English, and was so soft spoken she could barely be heard in the noisy place even though we asked her to speak up. After leaning toward her several times she still didn't get the message. Older lady came and helped her split my flautas order into two chicken and two beef. Ordered the steak tacos, a sandwich for wife, and bean and 3 cheese burritos for the kids. Took 20 minutes to get order although few ahead of us. Drove 10 min home. They missed one burrito in our order. Food was quite cold and frankly not that great. Burritos nothing special and steak tacos fairly tasteless with fatty meat. Chips that came with meals were ok, and salad ok. May go back for ice cream or pastries but not food. I like to support local restaurants but not this one.
