7D-ATDP9Ezr1ZehszsotOQ I liked their food. Waitress was very accommodating to our large group, despite a slight language barrier. Friendly staff, and everything I tried was great! (The grilled chicken, guacamole, & a tamale a la carte) it looks tiny from the outside, but go inside!!! Beautiful Handpainted murals on the walls, and colorful details. Really feels like a trip to Mexico.
