sx25Ienna-PRIOm7_4gMAA Honestly, George's review pretty much summed this place up.

Main Street Tavern doesn't attract  the college crowd, but you will find plenty of townies dining here.  At 7pm on a Thursday, the place was packed, mostly with families and old couples.  The restaurant's decor hasn't been updated in a very, very long time, but that sort of adds to the charm.  It's pretty much as unpretentious as you can get.

The serve up a small-ish selection of diner foods.  Unlike many diners nowadays with their 10+ page menus, Main Street Tavern keeps it simple.  Their breakfast menu only has the basics, and I don't think they serve breakfast all day.  The lunch/dinner menu includes salads, soups, sandwiches, and a few entrees.  Nothing fancy- just diner fare.  The prices are quite cheap (we're talking $3 for a grilled cheese) and the quality of food is good (although not great).  Service was friendly, if a bit on the slow side.  I'll likely be back again.
