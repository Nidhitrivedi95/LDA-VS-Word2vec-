aEGV0W2i8HRoDFsRrMz-BA Delivery, yeah for delivery! Only ordered 2 items, fried catfish yum! And family carnitas which is 2lbs. Not sure why they shredded it all, made it REALLY dry. It was ok, but we will not be ordering it again. Big props though for the salsa and sides!  I asked for extra crispy fish and it was crispy when it got to my house! I will order again, and try different things.
