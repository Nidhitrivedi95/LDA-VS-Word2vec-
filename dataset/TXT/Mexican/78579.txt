CQokoa1vN8j6OP7dyizJDw I used to be a manager at a different Chipotle and I can honestly say that this is one of the best locations in the valley.

I highly recommend going to any Chipotle during the busy hours, even though there is a long line. This is because you can be assured that the food will have just come off the grill. Coming during the mid afternoon can sometimes lead to being served food that has been sitting on the steam table for a while. Being that this location is in Tempe Marketplace, they are constantly cooking to keep up with the line that develops with the movie theater being right there.

I have snuck many a burrito into Harkins (thank God for my girlfriend's huge handbags) and although stuffed with maximum food, they usually stay intact throughout the whole journey and during eating. The Chipotle itself has tons of seating inside and out, however there is a bird problem on the patio.

All in all, go to this one if you can avoid the ASU location. The ASU locations hires many students (which means high employee turnover) so you're bound to have a burrito rolled by a trainee.
