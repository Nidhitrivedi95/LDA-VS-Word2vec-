lv5Bnqlt93NnvNJ2oNcQ8Q This place is so CUTE! Went in today and our server was Edgar, he was nice. I ordered a pineapple margarita that was soooo good. The menu is extensive and I'll be back to try other items because the chips and salsa they serve had me full lol. The staff was so nice and the manager stopped by a few times to Check on us which is always nice! Overall I can't wait to check this place out again!
