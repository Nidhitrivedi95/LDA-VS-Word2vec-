Not too bad a price point for solid tacos. I love tacos with good soft tortilla shells that are slightly chewy and thick (as opposed to dry, paperlike texture).
The carne asada taco was so good!! Get it! 
Carnitas has pretty strong ... cinnamon? Anise? That spice flavoring they probably used to marinate/braise the meat. Just..somewhat overpowering esp for someone who isn't a huge fan of cinnamon (ikik, im weird - dont like pumpkin spice latte for the same reason). I had to slather their hot salsa on the taco to mask that flavor. 
Their sauces were rly good.
