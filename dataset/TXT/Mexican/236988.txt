SW6ZQk22G1_CV81_gfnvNQ Hands down the best Cod tacos I've ever had, just the right amount of crispiness, lightness, saltiness, acidity and vegetables. Also must tries are the ceviche (they get the lime acidity perfectly in my opinion) and also the charred corn with spices and crema sauce (was it goat cheese or creme fraiche? I'm not sure). Finally the only thing I disliked were the house chips which I found were too salty and greasy, but I guess that's how many people like it. Would highly recommend it anyone who enjoys unpretentious, delicious food in a trendy environment.
