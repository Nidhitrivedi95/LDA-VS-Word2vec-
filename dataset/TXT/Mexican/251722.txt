UoRSHohdGuzfrpydZ9j0Lg I've been to this place a number of times...but I've yet to experience it!  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because they're clearly doing something good for it to always be full...  That being said, however, it's not hard to fill this place up because it's ridiculously tiny.  The bar is a decent size but the number of tables is ridiculous.
