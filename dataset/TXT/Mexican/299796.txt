ZLG7N4VDGzo7V0ViITi93Q My friend and I thought we'd give tortas a try. I got the mini Del Rey which didn't seem so mini to me. It had all the meats in it and an omelette. OMG!! My friend got the mini Norteña de Res torta and we both got the small ceviche tostada which was AMAZING!! So delicious! The tortas were delicious too. Mine was quite messy. Next time I'll get a more manageable one. Trying to bite into all that meat was a little overwhelming. Lol!! Be warned the minis aren't very mini. If those were minis then the regular sized ones must be huge!
