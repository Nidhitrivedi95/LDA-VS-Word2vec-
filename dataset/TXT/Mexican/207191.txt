q6igRYs2UTO-4nTwlttrAQ The people who work during the lunch hours from 12:00PM to 01:00pm are extermely rude, they seemed agigated that I used a coupon. The male genetleman, kept asking the girl, if I put anything else in my burrito( i.e. queso or Gucamole). He asked both girls. The tortillas are undercooked. I took the order to go and purchased a a large beverage. I am not sure, what these employees problems are. There was one male and two females. It appeared, the male was the manager. I am from CA and I am pretty familar with Panchero's and have always had a great experience, but Pancheros in AZ has left a bad test in my mouth. I will never recommend this place to anyone and will tell everyone about my experience. One word of advice to your the owner of this franchise, invest in training your employees to have great customer service skills. Customer service is everything.
