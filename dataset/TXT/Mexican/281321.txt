XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg I went to the Mesa Grill this last weekend in Las Vegas because my family really, really want to try Bobby Flay's restaurant.  I was not very impressed.  

I will say the food is excellent so if you are going ONLY for the food then you are the right spot. The Queso Fundido and the Tuna Nachos were excellent. The steak was flavorful but not to die for.  The service was ok, not great.   

My biggest disappointment was the lack of choices for wine by the glass.   Any of the good choices were by the bottle and extremely for overpriced for the labels they offered. If you are the only wine drinker in the group it sucks.  It seemed a shame not to have a really good glass of wine to compliment the dishes. 

Lastly if you still want to go after reading this then be sure to make your reservation about a week before you get there or expect to eat really, really late.
