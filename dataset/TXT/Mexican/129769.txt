I779CNMLWhZu6BxkGfLvwQ I was looking for a new place for my friend and I to try so, as usual, I turned to Yelp. Impressed with the reviews here, I decided to try Smokin Fins. The folks here did not let me down! Only opened since March of this year, this little gem is sure to become a favorite spot. The atmosphere is upbeat and fun yet comfortable. The server was friendly, well informed, and checked on our table just the right amount of times. The menu has a nice variety but at the same time was not overwhelming. The food is fun and unique and so, so, so delicious. We had the avocado and shrimp crisp, fried calamari, lettuce wraps and edamame. Each dish was cooked perfectly and the portions were just right. So happy to have found a new restaurant! Cannot wait to return!!
