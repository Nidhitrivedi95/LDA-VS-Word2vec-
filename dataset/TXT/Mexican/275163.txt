XcOy_IMkPO9jGBox6mHT8w Another visit to Phoenix/Scottsdale, and two return visits to this amazing little hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant.
I am a carne asada taco aficionado and this place has the best tacos I have ever had.  (Maybe a few places in San Diego have come close).
Just get anything with their red salsa and you won't be disappointed.  Everything I have ever had here has a special homemade taste, from the pinto beans to the tacos.
