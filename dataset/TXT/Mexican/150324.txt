Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ I wasn't sure what to review this place. If it's for atmosphere I'd give it 5 stars. People watching on the strip was a blast. We sat at the counter seating overlooking the Bellagio fountain show. It was awesome! Our hosts and server were also excellent! However, I had to knock it down to 3 stars for the food. My boyfriend and I both disliked our meals. I am a mexican food lover so I just couldn't be happy with the food here. I would definitely come back just for drinks and thr view though!
