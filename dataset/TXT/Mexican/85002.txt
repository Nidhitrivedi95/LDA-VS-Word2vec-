D9Uf7UmU2KlgS_H8lJwOrA I came here for lunch because a co-worker wanted to try it. I decided to order the veggie small burrito. I think that they must have mistaken and given me a regular, because it was ginormous. I love most veggie items at places... but this one was underwhelming. None of the flavors stood out... the only thing that I noticed while I was eating it was whenever I got a bite of sweet potato, because it was sweeter than the rest of the burrito. My co-worker said his chicken burrito was good. 

I doubt I'd go back, but he said he would... 

However, for its size, it was definitely an inexpensive option. Only like $5 for my burrito.
