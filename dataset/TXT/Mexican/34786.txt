5-fpVbhoZcuSWatzof5YIg Stopped by on a Tuesday evening around 7:30pm for dinner. We ordered a California Bowl with Chicken and the Grilled Salmon Two Taco plate.

Our food took 30 minutes to arrive and when it arrived it was room temperature. The salsa/condiment area was messy and mostly empty. Fortunately, we were able to get a little bit of salsa to go with our chips. 

Overall a distinctly unsatisfying experience. The food was edible, but there are many other places nearby that serve similar foods ... warmer.

Not sure how, even on their best day, a place like this could deserve FIVE stars. It's a mediocre FAST FOOD restaurant.
