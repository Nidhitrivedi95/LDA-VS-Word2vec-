Db3CfZWrtG33UZSs8Tdlsg Seriously the best! We noticed in the Steele Creek area by us there's no chipotle but with Sabor there's absolutely no reason for chipotle. Sabor is absolutely amazing! I love the quinoa and brown rice option, vegetarian options and the empanadas are TO DIE FOR! It's enough for two meals for me when I get the build your own bowl. My som actually prefers it over chipotle and so do I. Tastes much more authentic!
