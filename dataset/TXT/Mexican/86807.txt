DI5lVpHe3xf-IPr_mgzxyg I love this place! Great quick stop for lunch. The staff has always been friendly and I LOVE their grilled fish burrito. The food is always very fresh, made to order. I wish they had more locations because I would go much more frequently. Prices are decent for the amount of food you get (large portions).
