I don't understand places that don't give you chips and salsa on the house... so I ordered chips and salsa. $3.00 for that but nothing special. I ordered a  vegetarian burrito and it was pretty small but pretty good flavor. Also came with the same exact chips and salsa I had ordered prior. I wish everything came with rice and beans... overall not bad but nothing very special. Don't know if I would go out of my way to come back here.
