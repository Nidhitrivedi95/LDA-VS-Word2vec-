BQJokxJ4y4s57i7Mn65pvA A-OK food (3 stars), but the service was horrendous beyond belief (-1 star).

Our waiter was the epitome of a douche. Throughout our entire meal, he was rushing us and didn't bother to listen to what we had to say. For example, I asked which seasoning sauce he recommended out of the three choices I had for the enchiladas and he basically just mocked me for asking and didn't answer my question. WTF? He got lucky that there was an automatic gratuity (which is probably why he thought he could act this way) since I had a party of 6. Otherwise, I would've left him a $0.99 tip.

Anyway, we got free chips and salsa (two kinds - red and green) which were yummy. Then we ordered two orders of guacamole (mild and medium), which they make in front of you! I think it was only $10, which is a steal compared to DC prices when they make the guacamole in front of you. The medium was basically mild... No hint of spiciness at all.

Me and a friend split the ceviche. We got the one that included both types of ceviche. I hated one of them - ahi something. It had wasabi in it, but after long days and nights of drinking, it tasted like Jose Cuervo to me. Blech. I liked the other kind though! The traditional Limey one with shrimp, cukes, etc.

Everyone in my group seemed to enjoy their meal - they got steak fajitas, chicken fajitas, ahi ceviche, taco salad.

I got the beef enchiladas. They were just okay. The rice was the highlight of my dish, which in reality isn't even that good. I was just hungry :-)
