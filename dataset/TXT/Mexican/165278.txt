LnIO_JtoDS1xLfTHWuV_ug Was craving Mexican food for lunch.  Went with friends.  I got the Mexican pizza.  It was disgusting. First it was cut hap-hazard, topped with jarred jalapeno mixed with carrots, and onions like a hot mix.  Horrible.  Guacamole had no taste.  I was so disappointed.  My friends were not happy with their food either however I cannot speak for them.  Their salsas left a LOT to be desired.  Will never go there again.  DO NOT RECOMMEND if you want decent Mexican food.
