wdCH53icp_R2jJDrCZk42g This is a standard Mexican restaurant.  The food is average, with some dishes that are better than others.  I tend to prefer the chili Colorado burrito.  We like this place because of the outdoor seating and the ability for the kids to run around outside a little, if not too crowded, so we can relax a little.  There are a lot better restaurants for Mexican fare, but this is convenient and close.
