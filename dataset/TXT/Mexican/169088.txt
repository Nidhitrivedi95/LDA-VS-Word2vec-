lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw Met up a girlfriend at Libre and left wanting a little more. First of all, they close at 10.... yes 10. Which left me alarmed from Vegas standards. We felt a little rushed for that reason. They don't offer any vegetarian tacos and their food all in all was very bland. Definitely wouldn't recommend the gauc. I had the mini tostadas, they were OK but again lacking flavor. They have margaritas for a dollar so that doesn't hurt. I'm not sure I would return necessarily.
