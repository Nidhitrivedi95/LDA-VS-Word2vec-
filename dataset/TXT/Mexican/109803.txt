fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg Experience was okay. They charge 3 dollars for chips and salsa. But if you check in on yelp you get it for free. The chips are thick and seasoned. The salsa had a good amount of spice and flavor. We ordered the trash can nachos to share. They were good. Not much meat or beans. On the menu everything is extra. They offer one price but when they take your order they offer other sizes or options that weren't on the menu. When you're trying to stay within a budget that becomes extremely frustrating. Prices on entres are insanely high and overpriced, and as I said, every little thing cost several dollars extra. Probably wouldn't go again.
