XfUoM-27iPHkbewPXepmFQ DO NOT GO THROUGH THE DRIVE THRU IN ANYTHING BIGGER THAN A COUPE!!!! I thought I was going to rip the side or front off my truck. Not sure who built this but it is INCREDIBLY tight. I actually rubbed the pole on the drivers side and got red paint on my truck. It was that or hit the retaining wall with the passengers side. Had to go up the curb and over the grass to get out. Looked back at the pole and the paint is removed on one side from everyone rubbing it with their vehicles. Chicken pieces are mediocre but really like their salads. Unfortunately,  I won't be going back because of the drive thru situation.
