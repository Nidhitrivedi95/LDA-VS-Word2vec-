pbeRNz7IU9rBqDOJcJf6LQ La Palapa was a fairly authentic Mexican restaurant. It had the colors on the outside and very friendly service from the staff. I really enjoyed the flavorful carne asada and beans. I wasn't crazy about the yellow-style type of rice. I guess because I'm used to tomato-based rice. The beef tamale was also good and not dried out as I often encounter when eating tamales. The waitress was kind, friendly and accommodating that she made our meal very pleasant. The one unusual thing that I did not like were all the people coming up to you to make money or begging. There was an accordion player, a trio of singers, a duet that kept singing at our table although we said no thank you, a little boy that was selling cookies, a trumpet player, a dancer, and then, I think, two Americans because they spoke perfect English and looked American, begging for money because someone in their family was dying of cancer. All this while we were eating or trying to eat. It was the strangest experience that I ever had dining and reminded me of when I was in Cabo San Lucas when people would wake you up on the beach to sell something to you (Hello...can't you see that I'm sleeping!). But that's Mexico for you. I can't imagine why the owner would allow all these people to come in and disturb the customers. I imagine this is authentic to how the restaurants are in Mexico. I don't think I'll go back because of that.
