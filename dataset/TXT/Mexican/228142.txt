I had the filete relleno. It is a white fish battered, fried and stuff with seafood like shrimp, octopus, etc. It is topped with a zesty mayo sauce that is flavorful and has a hard, slicy punch. The dish is served with more pinto beans, Spanish rice, and guacamole on top of rice. Everhthing tasted fresh except for the dry Spanish rice. It looked like they had put a can of mixed vegetables in it as well. Who wants peas in their Spanish rice?! Overall, the dish is pricy but worth it. 

Their tortillas are authentic and well made. I have been taught how to make tortillas and these exhibit all the necessarily attributes. 

For dessert try their churros. The cinnamon sugar, caramel sauce and whip cream are heavenly. Yes, that was the Yelp coupon they offered.
