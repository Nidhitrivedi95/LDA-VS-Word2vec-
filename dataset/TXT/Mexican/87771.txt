DKXUkIrFnMUMF535gf-dPA We live right around the corner and I kept seeing all the great reviews so we had to stop in. I am really glad we did, I was pleasantly surprised! I order the fish burrito meal and my husband got lengue, cabeza, al pastor and carne asada tacos and WOW they were amazing! Of course I had to try a little piece of all the tacos he had, al pastor was the best I've ever tasted. The lady behind the counter let us try samples of all the aguas frescas and I think the cucumber is my favorite so far! The decor is nice, restaurant was clean and food was quick and WOW WOW WOW. Another reviewer said it has a fast food type feel, which I understand because you order and they bring it to you, but it is way better than anything you will ever have fast food wise. Definitely recommend anytime they're open, can't wait to go back.
