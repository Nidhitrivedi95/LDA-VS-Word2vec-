T2tEMLpTeSMxLKpxwFdS3g Cabo is a home run - every. single. time.  Located in the funky NoDa neighborhood, there's almost always a wait, but it's definitely worth it.  Fortunately, you can put your name in with the host and they'll text you when your table is ready.  While waiting,  grab a drink at one of the nearby bars or browse in the stores across the street.  If there's only 2 of you, take a look at the bar - you may be able to get a seat there.  There's a second bar in the room to the right - don't forget to look there!

Once seated, you'll be greeted with a basket of chips and a bowl of corn salsa.  If you don't care for corn salsa (though, it's d-lish), you can ask for another type of salsa.  Their guacamole is fresh and very tasty.  You also won't be disappointed with shrimp and crab dip - creamy, cheesy, seafood goodness. 

My absolute favorite item on the menu is the Tavarua tuna tacos.  You get large pieces of perfectly cooked (medium rare) tuna topped with an amazing honey wasabi sauce - think sweet and spicy.  I also really like the salmon guacamole salad - they will cook the salmon how you like - rare for me - and it's done to perfection!  

Whenever we have guests in town, I love to come here. There's something for everyone, but it's still unique and memorable.
