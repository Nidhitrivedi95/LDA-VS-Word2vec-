What I mean by a "mess" is that I feel like they have no direction in who they are trying to get in here. It was kind of cool that it felt like anyone was welcome but I don't know who they are targeting.

There is a mechanical bull for the cowboys/cowgirls, stripper poles for the ladies, beer pong for the frat boys, punk rock serves, and hip-hop music. There was just a lot of different things going on, but that did make it a little more fun as I just sat back and watched the show.

The drinks were a little less expensive then the average bar/night club, and they do offer some good deals. There are also a tone of TV's and of course each one is playing something different.

This is a coin toss...go there or don't but if you do, they will have something you enjoy and something you wont.
