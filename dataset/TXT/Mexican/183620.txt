NOfbzTpQ7hrt6ZbJVeXUUw The WORSE Mexican restaurant of all time.
Food is tasteless and expensive. Servings are bite size. Had to have dinner after our first and last visit.
Margarita was 90 % ice. $6.00 HH Save your $$. 
Taco Bell serves better food.
Service was below average.
No redeeming things to say. This place won't last
