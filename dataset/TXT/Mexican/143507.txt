JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg The food is really good here in had the street tacos that were really good. Only negative was that my Margarita was really salty. I even asked for one with no salt on the rim and it was still quite salty to me. But overall a good place to eat. Setting is coo and for us guys makes it even better that it's next door to a pretty good strip club here in Vegas. Service is good as well just kinda slow during happy hour. The Flan is really good and the Chef is extremely nice even came out to personally give us our Flans.
