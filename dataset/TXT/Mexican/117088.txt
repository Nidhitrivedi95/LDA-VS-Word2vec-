gOBxVkHpqtjRRxHBIrpnMA I have fond memories of Chipotle.  Despite being shown around Los Angeles -- a city full of phenomenal, authentic cheap Mexican food -- I honestly enjoyed my Chipotle burrito the most out of everything I ate while I was in L.A (also - never go to L.A. - worst city in the world).  I wasn't sure what to make of it - was Chipotle that good?  Or am I just crazy?

So - I went back home to Vancouver - a city where Mr. Chipotle didn't think it was profitable to open up a location.  The fact that I couldn't have it, made me want it more.

Add to the fact that my co-workers happen to live in states where there are Chipotles and a constant topic of discussion in our group chat was 'How good is this Chipotle?' while they enjoyed their burritos (partially to troll me) -- that was irritating to say the least.  Seriously - they went from discussing how great the new Thomas Keller restaurant is and then talk about how awesome their Chipotle was in the same breath.  Chipotle is that good or we're all just that crazy.

If I was Tantalus, it would have been Chipotle burritos above my head and Everfresh Grape Cocktail at my feet.

So - imagine my joy when I found out that Toronto not only had Chipotle, but there was on 5 minutes from my apartment -- perfect lunch distance.  I was so happy that I would feast on the food of the fast food gods again.

To begin - it's obviously not as good as I remember.  It's obviously not authentic -- but that doesn't necessarily make it bad.  The ingredients are fresh and it's tasty.  When you have one loaded up: overly salted and really rich?  Yup - but this is some damned solid fast food.

So - I stand by it: I like Chipotle.  Although for some reason, I feel a bit ashamed to say it.  Like Eric Cartman, I'll eat Chipotle even if it means blood stains in my underpants: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU52dvVvt_o
