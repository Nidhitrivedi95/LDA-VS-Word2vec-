F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw While the food is good, I'm not a huge Mexican food fan. The guac is fresh and delicious and that is usually as far as I get food wise.

BUT THE MARGARITAS?! They are out of this world even if sometimes the are a little too sweet. They are always delicious though. I have gone for happy hour with a lot of different people and they've all loved them. I get the sampler every time because I can never choose just one. 

Overall the place has a great vibe and there are always great/interesting people there and the owner is a super nice guy. I love this place.
