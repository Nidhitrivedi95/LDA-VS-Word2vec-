M93N96pw4t_Rc3ACDm2dcw Hmmmm burritos , I love burritos.  Pintos make burritos with pinto beans ;) I'm in. Can't say that I have ever heard of this chain of fast mexican food but I can say that it makes a tasty healthier style of mexican food that I'm used of. Went in the other day to grab some lunch and saw that it was slammed! I thought Pancho Villa and his gang was raiding the place! Being smart , ( so I like to think ) I quickly jumped in line before the drifting smells of tacos and such made it down the street and attracted more people like bees to flowers . I decided what I wanted in line opting for a healthy choice and saw that the line had indeed grew substantially . The burrito I had was not to bad. Not great but not bad. Seeing as how the gentleman who served me looked stressed I will forgive him for the amount of rice in my burrito it was a lot to say the least. I did like the grilled chicken which had good flavour. I do think they should throw some lime wedges as options and plenty of cilantro which was completely lacking . If you want to do baja style take away burritos you need at a minimum lime and cilantro and even some radishes but that's just my opinion. Otherwise not a bad little place and I will be coming back again to try the quesadillas for they did look mucho gusto. I do encourage you if you read this to go try the place though because it is new and needs to stretch its legs and let us know on here how you found it to be. Adios!
