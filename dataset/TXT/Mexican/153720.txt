K-uQkfSUTwu5LIwPB4b_vg This place is horrible! The table side guacamole was just pre-made products tossed together from a distance and tasted like Walmart. The street corn was just frozen corn tossed with mayonnaise and salsa and topped with cotija cheese. The chef has obviously never been to Mexico or even had a really bad example of the real thing. The portion was a complete joke for $9. Don't think you are able to share it although it's so bad you may not finish it. The chicken anticuchos can definitely be shared but why would you want to? This is a horrible example of chicken satay gone wrong! The pork shoulder tacos were laughable! You cannot pick it up, it was so sweet that you could not swallow it. I felt like I was at a all you can eat  Chinese buffet without the all you can eat. The chef should should be chopped!
