VtgFuz3LXsrGB-SzPSQbDg I just ate the best brisket sandwich ever. I'm a serious BBQ snob and finding this place in Phoenix I was skeptical. The brisket was perfect. Smoky and blackened on the ends and yet tender and juicy, seriously they give you sauce but I didn't want to ruin it. The bun was amazing and toasted with butter. I waited about ten minutes in line but it was worth it. The staff are super friendly and the venue is pretty cool. Highly recommend this place!!
