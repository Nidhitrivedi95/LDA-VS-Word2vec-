nWD8OWd_DAXGubGpFenmiw My friends were craving Mexican so I decided to bring them to La Hacienda as I recalled walking by it earlier that day. We ordered 3 Chorizo burritos, one Chorizo enchilada and a pitcher of Margarita. Our meal took almost 30 minutes to prepare, despite being one of only two occupied tables. The burritos were very small and consisted only of Chorizo, cheese and beans. It also came with store bought Tostidos with a tiny portion of salsa on the side which is a huge no no my opinion. The taste was average and for $15 each, we all would have preferred Burrito Boyz/Chipotle (not the best benchmark for authentic Mexican) and get a better tasting burrito that would actually fill us and also put more money back in our wallets. The best part of the meal was the Margarita, but even that came at a steep price of $63. There are definitely better Mexican restaurants around the area with larger portions for the same price.
