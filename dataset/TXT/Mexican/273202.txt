WYDjn71X5xiEdpLxlT12hQ You SHRUNK the burrito!!!!!! SHAME ON YOU CHIPOTLES for thinking nobody would notice!!!! I was a HUGE FAN until the past 3 times i came there to eat.. The burrito got so small you can't even fit most of the sides on it.. The burrito was also VERY COLD!!!!!! AND I KNOW LEFTOVERS WHEN I TASTE THEM!!!!!!!!  You had an outstanding business going and i can tell you from working in the food business, when you start to get CHEAP, you WILL go down...... FAST!!!!!!  There was no reason for your business to start JIPPING people when you had such an outstanding crowd of people coming in and lines out the door..  Why would you want to RUIN a good thing? The bright side to all this, your lines should be getting smaller now when everyone figures out the burrito's got smaller... SHEISTY!  Never going back, you lost our business.......
