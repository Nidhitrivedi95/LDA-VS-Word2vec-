Bf2fuqWbHd3L-X69FSMvmg I was raised in Southern California and have been to Mexico (both Baja and the mainland) many a time. Ever since I moved to Canada, I have been missing authentic Mexican food, and my meal at El Trompo is the first one that even comes close to the delicious little street meat tacos I remember. 

However, if we were comparing these tacos to real Mexican tacos, I'd say it's a solid three stars. On the other hand, we'd have to compare El Trompo to the lack of good, authentic Mexican food in Toronto, then it's definitely 5 stars. I had the combination with bean soup (which was absolutely yum, and perfect for the chilly day) and 5 Al Pastor tacos. The meat was tender, and I love the sweetness of the pineapple with the pork. I also ordered the churros (fried dough rolled in cinnamon and sugar), which were okay but served cold -- they should have been served warm. 

I'd definitely come here again when I'm feeling a little homesick.
