VH2BjFjc9usDquDgoHhptA We stopped in here for a drink to kill some time. My husband says this was the best salsa he's ever had.  The classic margarita I ordered was great and pretty cheap which was great! Huge round bar inside and looks like it had a great build your own taco menu. We didn't stay for food but would definitely return!
