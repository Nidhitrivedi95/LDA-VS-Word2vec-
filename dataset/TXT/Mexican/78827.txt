cRMC2eQ9CP6ivhEY8EdaGg I went to San Francisco earlier this summer as a non-burrito fan, and was completely converted after eating burritos on Mission street.  Now that I'm back in Toronto, burritos have generally been disappointing so I was skeptical about Chino Locos, especially after some of the reviews I've read.  

WOW.  I was wrong.  I had the pollo loco and my boyfriend had the steak, both with rice, to go, on white tortillas.  These burritos were glorious.  Nice and toasted, full of good stuff (black beans, not refried!  lots of guacamole, moist and flavourful meat).  Medium spiciness was the perfect amount of heat.  So glad my boyfriend convinced me to go.  The prices were also what I think a burrito should cost.  Will definitely be back.  Give this place a try!
