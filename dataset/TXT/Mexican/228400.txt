S8VRQCBrbZI04zjCOc1RAA best place in Pittsburgh.  The outside taco stand is the best, can't even describe how sick it is.  Unreal.  The food in the grocery store is so cheap and the produce is really fresh and about a quarter of the price of Giant Eagle.  There is no reason not to eat at this place or shop there all the time.  I probably go about 4 times a week just for tacos (granted its only a 10 minute drive).   Tacos are 2 dollars each toppings are free (4-5 salsas, 3-4 hot sauces, guac, pickled radish, other stuff).  They are usually open from 1-9 daily from what I have seen.
