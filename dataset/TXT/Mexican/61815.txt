AUl6myFhTAbEqt0GMdKHiw Ordered the burrito they did a good job of explaining the meats and letting me have a taste.  Bought the chips and salsa.  The chips we threw away it was though you were eating pure salt.  Whoever makes the chips should lightly salt it after taking from fryer.  A little salt goes a long way.  So, good burrito and salsa was good we went to smiths store and bought chips to eat.
