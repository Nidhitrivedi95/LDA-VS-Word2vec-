q7MorRPzU_J-iekeDKUKgw I dig this place. I'd heard and read a lot about their Mexican eats and tequila forward cocktails, but I never had the opportunity to give them a try until recently when I was there for a corporate event taking over the entire venue.

As you might imagine, being on Ossington, it's not a big space but this little diamond in the rough shines as one of the brightest spots along the strip. A long bar inside with plenty of seating, a fair number of tables and now that warmer temperatures are there a nice covered back patio behind the restaurant. Yay!

Most of us were standing around as a variety of menu item faves were passed around by servers. The tacos were fantastic in my opinion, simple in their composition but hearty and generous in portion size. 

I had a few bites, enough to entice me to return soon, but the fire was lit under my ass by their cocktails! Such perfect execution and totally willing to make adjustments to taste. I asked for a Mezcal Mule, something that was off menu and they were quickly able to pivot and make something exactly to my liking!

Can't wait to come back for a proper meal and add that final star!

Eatcrest Out!
