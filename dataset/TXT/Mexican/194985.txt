Oto60yDwk1z72WmfWEYrjg Entree came with a Fideo soup! Complimentary chips, guac, beans and salsa! With stay at the hotel here you also get a free margarita with the purchase of an entree, woo! Food was pretty yummy too! My boyfriend had the golden Cadillac and that was super tasty and you could definitely taste the alcohol. I had the house margaritas. The corvette summer was.. Ok. But other than that we are happy with this restaurant. Service is great as well!
