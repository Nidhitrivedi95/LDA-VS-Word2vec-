S_bG5WWbtNXhhY9Y0GTcSg Tried this place out for dinner the other day. I had the avocado tacos since I'm a vegetarian and they were average. my friends had the agua chile scallops and nopal tacos. they said the agua chile scallops were the best part of their meal. I hope the dinner menu evolves a bit by including a side of rice or beans when you get more than one taco. I guess I just expected more since I had one drink and two meatless tacos that came out to about $24.
