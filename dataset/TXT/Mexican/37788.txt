5VMqROXPjHCKdlPnm0xyvQ I actually prefer moes to chipotle. There's much more options. Like the black olives and fresh jalapeños and cilantro. Not to mention the delicious sautéed mushrooms and onions. 
I get a veggie burrito every time I go and I haven't been disappointed yet. 
My only critique would be the guacamole. It's just not on the same level as chipotles guac. It's always slightly brown and watery.  
Also A+ for the rewards program! Put in your number at the register and you get a free entrée after 10 visits. My husband and I have both earned free meals already.
