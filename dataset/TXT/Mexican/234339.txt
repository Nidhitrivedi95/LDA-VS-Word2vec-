sUzvletCYiIaZD_hbnNLEA This is by far the worst fast food restaurant I have been to. I live close by and have been here several times. It is painfully slow every single time. 

I ordered a chicken quesadilla and it took 15 minutes for me to get my food. The food itself is fine but the service is horrible. I don't think I can handle coming here anymore.
