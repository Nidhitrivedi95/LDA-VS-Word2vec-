MAuSh7NKoT__CQ4BumoayA My friend and I just wanted to chill have some drinks and chips and salsa... this isnt your typical Mexican cantina with free chips &a salsa..: waited forever for guacamole... the menu is pricey... nothing less really than $15-$20. Would have ended up having an almost $100 dinner... opted for one appetizer to share...
