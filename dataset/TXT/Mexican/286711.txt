yAXWKWRTs4wNy-zrJgoeXQ Do yourself a favor and get the pancakes. Our server Jacob helped us choose what dishes we should order.  He also gave us some good local tips.  We split a spinach and mushroom egg dish with side of home fries.  All of the staff seemed upbeat and attentive to our table.   I would recommend locals check out this place for brunch, wish we lived less than a state away so we could try more things on the menu.
