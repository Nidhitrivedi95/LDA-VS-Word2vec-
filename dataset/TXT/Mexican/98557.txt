EP1do6l8hLyIGEru0gN3EQ I've come here a few times, and despite the amazing ambiance, my experience + food has been just a-ok.

The biggest plus is the environment. There's a lot of energy here with some cute decor. To enter the restaurant, you pass through a heavy curtain into a dark interior with brightly painted walls and decorated tables. It can get pretty loud, which can be a pro or con depending on what type of dinner you're trying to have!

Johnny Mango has a pretty eclectic menu. They shoot for healthy + organic food (possibly local?) and while I appreciate the freshness, I don't quite connect with some of the flavors. It tends to be a little more on the acidic side. I always end up going for the veggie burrito, which I always forget is merely a veggie wrap. They offer different sides with the big plate each time, and the quinoa + legumes were okay. I think my favorite part is always the beans and the caramelized banana. 

I've never had drinks here, but I hear those are worth ordering. Also, I keep hearing about taco tuesdays which sounds AMAZING, but it's hard to get a seat! Maybe I need to try harder...
