IiwgHkUbBt9Ha25H4dUtkw I love coming here. There are always so many different things to see and try. I like their assortment of licuados and enormous variety of pan dulce. Prices are super reasonable and they have a great produce section. It's definitely a place worth coming to at least once. Completely different from your standard grocery store. There also is a restaurant on site!
