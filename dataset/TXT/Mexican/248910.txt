The decor of this place is awesome...really  nice!  Great bar.  Whenever I go to a new Mex place I order a bean burrito, cheese enchilada, beans and rice.  This has become my, "barometer" meal after the chips and salsa.  Chips were pretty good.  Salsa was very good...love the fresh cilantro.  Food was every bit 4.5 stars.  Beans were really good and not the usual slop out of a can.  Why not a 5-star rating then?  No mole on the menu.  I was sad.  Service seemed a bit confused....I was given a menu and table service by the hostess, then the bartender took my drink order, and then someone else came over to ask if the bartender had taken my food order.  This might be a case of the waitstaff pooling tips but I think it was because they are newly opened and still working out a few kinks, all of which are easily overlooked because of the atmosphere and food quality!  Bravo to Don Ramon.  Oh wait I forgot the $6.99 weekday margarita special.  Of course I dipped into one of those.  There are few rules in life and one of them is never pass up a weekday margarita special.  Buen provecho!
