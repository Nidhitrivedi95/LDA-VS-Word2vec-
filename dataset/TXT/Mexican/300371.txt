zN4f3aLeCuIhCTPRH0di-A Salud never disappoints. The chef, the bartender, the hostess - the entire staff is always super friendly and helpful. Plus, the food is amazing. Today we had a delicious lunch of queso fundido, stuffed jalapeños, carne asada tacos, a veggie wrap, and posole soup. Our waitress, a young woman named Z, was gregarious and familiar with the menu and the ingredients we asked about when trying to make our selections.
