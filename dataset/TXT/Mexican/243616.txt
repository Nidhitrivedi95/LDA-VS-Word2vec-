thLX_k20SPJ0KyusGTBIHw We ordered the Brussels sprout nachos, several tacos, chips and salsa (spicy!) and some margaritas. Everything was amazing and a great deal during Taco Monday/happy hour. The atmosphere is very laid back and fun with an awesome patio. I don't usually write many reviews, but we haven't even left this place and I had to hop on here. Our waiter is probably the best we've ever had-he is very attentive, helpful, and friendly without being overbearing. Beyond impressed with the service we received tonight. Ask for Steve next time you are here!
