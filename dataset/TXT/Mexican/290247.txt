Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Unreal dining experience. Firstly, the staff was so accomodating and courteous. Calling our valet after the meal from the other entrance of Wynn, etc... amazing. 

The ambiance- GORGEOUS. We opted to sit outside in the sun and overlooking the pool area. Great table with comfortable benches, etc. 

The food- WOW. The white chocolate and orange bread french toast was heavenly and I ordered the tableau breakfast that came with, prepare yourself: 
Two Eggs, Any Style 
served with Nueske bacon, Tableau potatoes & toast 
our warm bakery basket with homemade marmalade, preserves & sweet butter all for $25. Talk about a steal. AND the homemade ketchup omg. 

We also has some benedicts and huckleberry pancakes or something that were also delicious. YUM! I cannot wait to return. I love Steve Wynn, his resorts and his restaurants. 
choice of fresh squeezed juice, coffee or tea
