ZO3ihx5FOObI_uCgin4x8w Have eaten at this chain restaurant a few times at various locations, this one did not disappoint.  Once again I had my traditional Chicken Chimichanga, it was great.  The chips and salsa were also good, great server. Then why a 4 star, salsa could have used another pinch of jalapeño or habernero.  Definitely will be back again. Reasonable prices, nice atmosphere.
