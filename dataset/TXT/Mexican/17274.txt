1JDRyjdfkE_iSwUGs_ZX1w I've been back recently and actually received what I ordered this time (devil shrimp).

I went from two to four stars definitely making this my favourite burrito place. Things actually taste good unlike burrito boys, fat bastard etc. I would HIGHLY recommending eating it right after you buy it, the oil still leaked out quickly on my bad last time and this time wasn't much different. The bad thing is that it stinks in there. They need a better ventilation system.
