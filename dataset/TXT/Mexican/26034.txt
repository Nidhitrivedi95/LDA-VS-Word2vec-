3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ Saw this place on the travel channel and had to try it while we were in town. 
For starters, We had the chorizo deviled eggs which were tooooo die for. That was so delicious, generous slices of flavorful chorizo on top of deviled eggs! So yum!!!
The complimentary salsa for the table was good, i must say the salsa was fresh, abundant amount of fresh tortilla chips! I could not stop devouring them.
The corn was delicious as well! 

Had the duck taco and the lamb taco. I must say both pretty underwhelming. The flavors sounded great on the menu. The duck had a sweet taste to it, i always look for the gamey meat taste that I crave from duck...and the lamb was overloaded with bleu cheese :( 

The service was great and the server was super attentive!
