2C5nGjdzF0zMWvD9iVma0g I made my first visit here today for the $2 taco special.   On the plus side, service was good and my three tacos looked good and were prepared quickly.   On the not so good side, the chicken taco was unseasoned.   The veg taco was pretty good.  Still a reasonable deal, maybe try something other than chicken for your taco filling.
