SWDxTrwU_qlEcJp36IYquw I'm rating at 3.5 stars, but don't have that option.  I went there never having had Cuban food before.  I had the pork and black bean rice.  As far as food goes, I liked it very much.  If I were to rate just the food, it would be 5 stars.  It was that good.  The service itself was also very good, and the server took good care of us.  No complaints there.  

However there were two issues.  The first was not within the restaurant's control, so it was not their fault.  There was a large, noisy family that literally took up half the restaurant, which has a small eating area.  I would say at most it can seat 40 people, if that.  While this trashy, noisy family was not the fault of the restaurant, it sort of put a damper on a first time experience at this place, as well as a first time experiencing Cuban food. 

The second issue was the dirty silverware.   The forks were poorly washed and had food particles on them. Since the server had their hands full with the obnoxious family, I didn't want to pile on with the silverware, and I just used a spoon instead, but I didn't like that.  

My recommendation is the food is great, and the servers are nice, but just get the food to go.
