Rv4aYEKmRsLrijjtq5CS5Q These have to be the most expensive fish tacos from a taco shop I've ever bought. I got 3 fish tacos "vampiro" (which is basically one tortilla deep fried with a little bit of cheese on it) and a drink and the bill was $14 and change. Didn't really catch it till I got home because it was late, so I went back the next day to ask about it. I hand the girl the receipt and she re-rings it to check if it's right and says, "No, it was actually supposed to be $15.32." What the what? I ask her why since the drive-thru window advertises a 3 taco combo for $3.85 and she says, "Not for fish. Fish is more." Ok. That might work, but there's a charge on the receipt for making them vampire for $7.30. So my bill was 70 cents less than getting a 3 shrimp taco plate with rice, beans, soup and service at LINDO. I don't get it.
