G7LYpILnHveyvbg3sJePPw I've been here twice this week and the food is delicious!!!! The first night I had to wait outside in line for 30 minutes just to get a seat for 1 at the bar. I ordered potato skins and beef tacos. The potato skins could've used more cheese (especially since they overlap them in an X shape) and I didn't like the salsa on the tacos but I still stuffed my face lol My next visit was during the afternoon and I tried the Sun Dried tomato penne pasta with marinated chicken and it was to die for!!! Definitely the best pasta I've had in awhile!! I also ordered a drink, "Bulldog" and it was obvious the bartender didn't know how to make it. He flipped through some printed out pages by the register before just looking right at the menu and using that to guide him. The end result tasted like a corona dunked in water and definitely wasn't worth the 12$. I look forward to trying something else her, but I'll avoid the mixed drinks.
