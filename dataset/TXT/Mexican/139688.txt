J5ebC7fKqrSF8KuS8d6hgw On the weekends this place gets packed so make a reservation.  My wife and me ordered a app, soup and an entree.  Got the guac that was tasty but small portion.  Then we were served the entree. When asked about the posole soup we had ordered they said they'd have it right out.  Was almost done with the entree by the time it came. The waiter said he would be right back with the cabbage and lime that was supposed to be with the soup. Well it never came until we asked 2 other times. Horrible service-props for tasty food.
