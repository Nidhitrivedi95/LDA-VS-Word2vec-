DKXUkIrFnMUMF535gf-dPA YUM.... TOO DELICIOUS! This spot is by our house, and has become our favorite go-to for awesome authentic Mexican food. They have a smaller menu then most Mexican spots in town (no tamales, enchiladas, etc;), but really hone in on serving deliciously seasoned and well prepared meats. 

The location is very clean and perfect for a quick bite, but we typically order the food to-go. They also carry fresh fruit juices called aguas frescas; my favorite flavor is the Jamaican, which mimics a hibiscus.  

We adore their mini tacos, which come served with onions and cilantro. They have a wide selection of meats including: carne asada, pollo, carnitas, al pastor, camaron, pescado, lengua, cabeza, and also vegetarian. The carne asada, carnitas, and al pastor are our favorites.

 We also really enjoy their platter plate, which serves the meat (I get carne asada) as a fuller portion, with rice,beans, avocado, and a salad as added sides. We love to get extra flour tortilla with this and basically make custom fajitas. They have awesome sour cream to add as a side, and a great green cilantro sauce with the salad.

 The al pastor quesadilla is also a favorite of ours, with chips & guacamole always being a must-have. The street corn is phenomenal, and I always ask for light sauce extra cheese. They also have fantastic salsa, and also amazing green/red sauces (spicy!)

I have not had anything I would not recommend here, but have not yet ventured to try their cabeza meat, or fish & shrimp entrees. Soon I will try their ceviche as I have heard good things. Everything is extremely fresh, and made homemade. You can tell the food is authentic and their is love within the preparation.

Our to-go orders have always been done efficiently, accurately, and packaged for easy travel. I would recommend this place to anyone, and can't wait to go back myself. Both lucky, and cursed this is by our house!


A+
