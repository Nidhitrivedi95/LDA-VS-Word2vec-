We came here to celebrate my sister's birthday as she had requested Mexican food for dinner. We were seated quickly and our server was friendly and attentive as he kept our drinks filled. We were able to order promptly and the food was delivered rather fast (we were dining on an off hour, so this was somewhat expected as there were only a few other people in the restaurant). However, the food was way below average and actually kinda gross (with the exception of the table-side guac). The cilantro rice was a sticky blob of mush and smelt foul (it tasted worse than it smelt!). My burrito was lukewarm and my husband's carnitas burrito had so much liquid in it, we joked that maybe he had actually ordered soup. At the end, they did bring out a sombrero for my sister and presented her with a small portion of flan that was actually very good.

I should note that I live near a town that has a large Mexican population which means I have access to incredible authentic Mexican food, so maybe my expectations were a little skewed.

We were also somewhat surprised that they do not allow any substitutions. This is more for future patrons to be aware and was not included in my overall rating as I respect their policy. My sister wanted to order the chicken enchilada platter with one chicken and one cheese enchilada (willing to pay the full price for the chicken enchilada platter), but was told that she would have to order everything a la carte. I understand not giving a discount for the lesser item or not allowing her to add a more expensive item, but we've never encountered a situation where they wouldn't allow you to sub for a cheaper option. A la carte would've been way more expensive.
