w55sCX7ZkLIJNhl_RhwjEg Love this joint, it's my bar and I bring all my fam and friends to drink there when they land. Katie, josh, jj, and Shawn are like family to me. The drinks are strong and cheap and they make you feel at home. It's a dive bar though, don't bring a date if you're trying to impress them.
