OA5Li3ySzhrbG_WvD_QGYA So We came here on a Friday for lunch.....as you know it's a hipster bar hang out.  Take that for what you will were not Hipsters . I don't judge people that's my MO and always appreciate the same in return!! 

We belly-Up'ed at the bar as usual....Andrea was our bartender/server.  She handles the room like a  Boss taking care of everyone. Our group hit it off like a 10yr reunion with the chick you never had a convo with in Highschool but always wanted too . Totally awesome. We all laughed Sooo hard throughout the banter that everyone left feeling like a dis-function-able family. 

And that's what's keep me coming back,
Not the bad ass tacos or the delicious Melted cheese (couldnt spell Casso right)  Whatever....it's the bad ass service that Andrea provides each and every time.....You want great service and better Banter check out Bario Tremont on Fridays.
