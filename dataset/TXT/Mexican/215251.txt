qYNl7Qh-YetWdMQTzX-jZA By far the best 'bertos location in this part of phoenix. I go out of my way to drive a little farther to this one, with at least a couple closer to me. Chile relleno burrito is really good, so is their veggie burrito. They also have 1.19 beans (only) burritos that are really big. Sometimes that hits the spot all on its own, and sometimes I get it to go, open it up at home and add my own cheese. That's like a 1.50 for a totally filling meal.
Their taco salads (which are on special on Mondays for like 5.49 incl. a can of soda) are disgustingly good. Those and the carne asada fries- eat with caution for your waistline's sake.
