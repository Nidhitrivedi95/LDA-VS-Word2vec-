as_fyujgsdwtV56n31z-Sw To start with, the Hostess kept her cool with an obnoxious guest, which in my book is awesome because what was happening was well beyond her control and he was being an ass! The Cilantro Tequila Cooler is awful. Way to sweet. The build your own guacamole was really good pared with a variety of chips. Hubby and I each got 3 different tacos to share. Each was equally delicious. The special for the evening was sold out which was a huge disappointment. Other than that our food was delicious and we each had a bit to take home. Will come back! 
P.S. This review was from 3 months ago. Wrote it and forgot to post it! Yikes.
