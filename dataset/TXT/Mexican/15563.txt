15yP8OOhUcESzYbLcm6s3g I had passed by this place several time, so when I finally got a chance I was excited to try it. Ordered some menudo, it had nothing but meat hardly any hominy, also ordered two cheese enchiladas, they were dry no flavor like the sauce came from a can. Spent $12 to come home and throw it all away, so disappointed
