This place was great but the prices are going up, the service is going down and staffs heads no longer fit through the doors. Used to be worth the trek to Parkdale but not anymore. Plenty more tacos where that came from. Like I'm going to wait two hours on a wednesday after being told 20 minutes and get all kinds of attitude on top of it... Then have a server explain the concept of rotation to me... 
You have folding chairs. Bye.
