E-_5sSD4Ofc8s7I8bMSidA Really good. 

The steak burritos here are delicious. I get it medium rare it turns out great every time. 

I have also tried the pulled pork and chicken burritos those are also done really well too.

They take orders by phone. Do it to avoid waiting 5 minutes in line. 

Service is great, ingredients are always fresh. I visit once a month on a regular. 

A++
