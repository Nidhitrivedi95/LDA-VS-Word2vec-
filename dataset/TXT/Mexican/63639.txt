B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA This. Place. Was. Amazing! I can't believe it took me this long to find a place like this. I had seen a similar place in San Francisco and didn't have a chance to try it. When I googled it I found this place and I am SOLD. I tried the 3 Amigos which had Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail with red onion, cilantro and Wasabi Aioli. It was quite busy which is good as that shows the place is going to be around a long time. I think next time I will make something of my own since you can do that too!

Don't think. Just go. Now.
