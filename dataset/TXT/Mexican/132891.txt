iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg Absolutely spectacular. Popped in after a haircut in the market, and I couldn't have been happier. Super casual, not a lot of seating, loud and crowded. But the tacos were phenomenal. I opted to try the carnitas, baja fish and octopus. Everything was fresh and flavourful, the fish was perfectly crisp, octopus was tender and charred, and the pork was melt in your mouth. Double tortillas just because the portions are so hefty, I'm not sure I could give a stronger yes.
