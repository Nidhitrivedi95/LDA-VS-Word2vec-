You get salsas and chips at the table (both options are spicy, but one will make your mouth burn and your eyes water). I wished it was more tomato-y salsa instead of sauces. Ordered the enchiladas verdes and chimichangas and two margaritas. The food was good, though a bit bland. Adding some of those spicy salsa sauces came in handy. The margaritas were delicious, but not very large (we ordered the large). Total amount was just over $40, with tip, for two people. Not bad! We'll be going again, but probably won't be making it our go-to for Mexican food.
