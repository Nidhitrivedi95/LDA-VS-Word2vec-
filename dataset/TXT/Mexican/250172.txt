UJb1PrUWDFfuzwUPc1pP4Q This location is like the typical college club/bar; one problem I have is we got a table but strangers were in the space 24/7 and security doesn't really care. If you were to spend money and get a table, don't bother because people are literally dancing on the reserved tables and what little spaces there are behind the tables themselves. We used our table more as a table top to place our drinks and make our mix drinks more than anything which btw no one would want to pay extra just for a table to place your drinks. 

TL;DR: Don't buy a table, it's an absolute rip off
