JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg So I originally wanted to come here solely based off of reviews. Well it definitely met my expectations. First off when we got there the setting was absolutely beautiful, the server was very well detailed in his menu knowledge. According to being certified as an organic restaurant, it has got to be 75%, well they are 85%. My friend and I shared a pitcher of margaritas, they were so delicious and strong. And then my boyfriend and I shared seafood enchiladas and tacos. The El Pastor was probably the best. The only thing that I think is a little strange is it is right next to Sapphire strip club. But do not be confused they are not affiliated, the restaurant is a family-oriented place. As a local here in Las Vegas I would definitely recommend this place whether you are visiting Vegas or just a local looking for a good spot to eat. Easy to get to off of the Interstate 15 and service is well and prices are great. I will definitely be back.
