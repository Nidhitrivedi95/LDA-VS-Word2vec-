-bMZCfTK7fxFaURynKpBMA I had quite high expectations for our meal here this weekend and to be honest, I wasn't blown away.  After further consideration, I think I perhaps ordered something that just wasn't for me.  

Things that bothered me:  

My house margarita was blue.  The drink menu said it had tequila and lime.  What was in there that was blue?  

My shrimp had the digestive tract intact which is a turnoff for me.  The Garlic Shrimp (which I see from other reviews is very popular) just didn't work for me.  It was essentially peppers, onions and shrimp in a literal bowl of garlic butter.  

Things I liked:  

The chips and salsa were excellent as were the tortillas.  

Loved the complimentary ceviche tostada.  

The coconut cake was out of this world.
