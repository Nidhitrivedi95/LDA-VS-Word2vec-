ZCvJ5xlxj2c-QzPLBOjtjw This place is located inside Carolina Mall and just for some folks who don't know where it is, it's located in Concord NC right next to the hospital. If I remember correctly, this place used to be Sbarro Pizza. 

I have been to this place quite a few times by now and I can honestly say that I have tried almost all their items but ONLY vegetarian. This is a perfect spot because it's right next to Papa John's pizza. So if kids wants to eat pizza where as someone like me Who is craving for Mexican food than it works out quite well. 

People here are friendly local people and I think it's even owned by local which is pretty good. I am all for supporting local as long as I get good tasty food at reasonable price :D 

If you are in the area, I would definitely recommend this place.
