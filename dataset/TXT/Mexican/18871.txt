1pm04v3jhOCDJjSMWiZSTQ This place is by my boyfriend's work, and he loves coming here for lunch. He gets the chicken rice bowl or burrito and likes both equally. Recently we went here to get dinner and I got the chicken sandwich. The sandwich was juicy and delicious. It's on par with habit burger chicken sandwiches, which are my favorite. Definitely worth trying or anything else on the menu as my boyfriend swears by everything he's tried.
