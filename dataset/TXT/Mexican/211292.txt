qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A We went there tonight for dinner.
The first impression was that the restaurant is clean.
The food is made to perfection when it comes to taste and presentation. For starters we had jerk fried calamari- it had a little bit of a kick to it but the sweet glaze reached our taste buds right after the spiciness did. For me, who is very sensitive to spice, this was the perfect dish.
I also got the raspberry fizz drink, which was made with fresh raspberries. The drink was fresh and did not have that overpowering sweetness that cocktails usually have.
Also, their desert is a must have. Their red velvet cake made our mouths water as soon as it came out. The texture was moist and it had the prefect amount of sweetness. It was also very light so we had no problem finishing the whole piece.
