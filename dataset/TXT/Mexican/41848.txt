We started off with the EMPANADAS de CHORIZO con PAPA which was fresh and tasty. I thought about taking pictures of the food, but thought otherwise. My wife had the Prickly Pear  Margarita which looked really refreshing. I'm a 'wuss' when it comes to alcoholic drinks, turning all different shades of red especially my eyes. We split the CHIPOTLE BBQ 
ENSALADA which was a little heavy on the dressing, but was still delicious. 
Our main course consisted of ENCHILADAS de MARISCOS and CAMARONES al TEQUILA. The Enchilada has good serving of shrimp and crab and the Camarones were cooked perfectly. Good thing I didn't have lunch. 
We ended the meal with coffee and Cinnamon Churros. It was a great dining experience and will return to try more of their menu items.
