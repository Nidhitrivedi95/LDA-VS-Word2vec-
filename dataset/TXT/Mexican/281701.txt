XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg I was here in January of this year.  Unfortunately, I had the flu almost the entire time I was in town.  So, after days of barely eating anything we finally decide I'm well enough to go out to a nice meal.

We went on a Saturday night which of course was busy but I think this place is most likely busy on all nights.  We were able to obtain a reservation for 9:30PM.  

I thought it would be slow by then.  Wow.  The place was still packed and they quit serving around 11PM.  

Everything was delightful.  Nice and warm with the Southwest flair.  We were excited about the prospect of ordering dessert as well, however, the appetizers and the meal filled us up so perhaps next time we will order dessert first.  :)

It was an enjoyable time.  However, because of the volume of people in the restaurant it was a little hard to have a conversation.
