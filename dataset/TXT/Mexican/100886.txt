ETSHD1lX0xcd2qInwiXxzA Very authentic very fantastic food! Our faves are the tapatio burrito, chimichanga, and al pastor tacos. The same lady helps us each time and she is very attentive and helpful. Eat here and you won't regret it!! We love taking our out of towners here for the authentic experience, great prices too!!

Sometime, they have empanadas on special - cheese ones are very delicious!!
