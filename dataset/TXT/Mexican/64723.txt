b65Ugu0VDKDNbLq7sW9RDQ I came here at 10pm on a Wednesday night and ordered a really annoying, complicated, custom order. I'm always wary when I make a custom order because I know it can be confusing and there is a lot of room for mistakes, but the guy working the drive thru was extremely attentive and patient and made sure that my order was made exactly how I asked. When I got to the window, the same server was extremely sweet and explained to me how he rang up my order based on all of my customizations. The food was delicious and fresh too. Awesome service at this Filibertos. Very sweet staff.
