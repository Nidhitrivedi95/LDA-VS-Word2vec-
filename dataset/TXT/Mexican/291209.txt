YSYDJTCt5kzY2kKnLNGRiA We were seated right away and the service was REALLY SLOW.  It took over 15 mins to get our drinks and about 1 hour for tacos and a quesadilla... Our drinks were never refilled and the waiter never came by once to ask how we were doing how the food tasted... My steak was still mooing! Gross! I ended up eating my kids quesadilla with chips and salsa.
