u1m3qTIrhZhwNjMT6n-M8g We tried this restaurant for the first time this evening and we were delighted. From the outside, it looks more like a bar but we were very pleasantly surprised when we walked in! The interior is beautiful, and very clean. They have a large open dining room and an attached bar. We were greeted very warmly at the front door and taken to our table quickly. Our server was a delight, and our food came out quickly (but not so fast that we couldn't enjoy the delicious chips and trio of salsa on the table).
The food was delicious! The portions were perfect! The service was wonderful... We even received a visit at our table from the owner at the end of our meal. He says they have been open for less than a year. I really wish this restaurant tons of success!
