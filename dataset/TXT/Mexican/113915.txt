GETVAz5SCk8rFziexV54Aw I grew up in the area and have never really paid too much attention to this shopping plaza, or any businesses in it. When I was out running some errands I saw a gentlemen holding a sign with No Que No, normally wouldn't think twice about it and go about my day. I get home and the wifey and I wanted to go grab a bite to eat, after several minutes of playing "what do you want to eat, what are you craving"she said Mexican. I remembered that sign from earlier, checked the all ever so important Yelp review, got the 4 kiddos ready and we were on our way. We get there and was surprised how much bigger inside than it appears from outside. Immediately greeted when we walked in, sat us right away and took our drink orders (waters). Great in expensive kid menu ($5) , our littles had a bean and cheese burrito and the other street tacos. They finished them! The bigger kiddos had the elote and a burger, also finished them. The wifey ordered a burrito and a side of rice and said it was really good. I'm vegan, I had the veggie burrito, since the rice and beans that come in the burrito were not vegan the waitress brought it out as a side dish for the wifey at no additional charge, I'm instead of the side if rice she ordered and would of had to pay for. This burrito had really good flavor, just wasnt spicy enough for me (nothing ever is). I asked the waitress if I could have a roasted jalapeno, she brought it right out, I put it on my burrito... Perfect! The staff was extremely attentive, never an empty glass, quick to remove finished dishes out of our way. Great service and food. Only wish I would have noticed this place 2 years ago when they opened, this will now be our go to Mexican restaurant.
