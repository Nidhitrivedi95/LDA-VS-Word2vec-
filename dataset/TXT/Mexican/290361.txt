Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ As we were staying at the Wynn, we ended up eating breakfast here. The restaurant is located right off the lobby of the tower suites. The atmosphere is comparable to a casual yet elegant restaurnat found in a Ritz or Four Seasons. Service is definitely in the 5 star category. 

At first glance the breakfast menu may seem over priced, but it is justifiable given the atmosphere, service and quality of food. The coffee is excellent. I had an omlette and my girlfriend had the french toast (white chocolate & Orange). No novel experiences here, but the food was flavourful and the eggs were perfectly cooked (IMHO, it is very hard to find perfectly cooked eggs) The Tableau potatoes are what will have me coming back. Croquette like hashbrown cakes with the perfect amount of sea salt sprinkled on each one. The home made ketchup was a nice touch (I missed it the next time I had some Heinz)

I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here if you were staying at a five star on the strip. Chances are your hotel has a very similar restaurant. However, if you are staying at Wynn or Encore I highly recommend Tableau.
