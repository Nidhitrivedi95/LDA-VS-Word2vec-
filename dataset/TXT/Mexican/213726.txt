qWi9dNGo9D9I4F9RANc-6g I really enjoyed the charred tomato salsa. The goat cheese guac was just blah. Nothing amazing about it until I added some of the house habanero sauce to it. Then it was delish, just needed something! hubby and I shared the wild Boar tamale and the butchers steak taquitos. No joke, that Wild Boat tamale may be THE most delicious thing I have ever eaten! I will be back just for that!! The steak taquitos were delicious as well, but the clear star of our meal was the boar.
