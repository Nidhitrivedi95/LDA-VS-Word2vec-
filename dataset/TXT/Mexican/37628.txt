I do not visit Manuels often however, a few friend of mine had a hankering for Mexican food and Manuels was the closest restaurant. When we entered the restaurant we were seated quickly and  our server immediately brought us chips, salsa, and our beverages. 

The menu at Manuels Mexican Restaurant is comprehensive, and offers a varied selection of entrée's.  On this visit we shared  a chili relleno, chicken enchilada,  cheese enchilada, red beef burrito, chips/salsa,  and a crispy beef taco.

Even though our entrée's arrived, piping hot, we all agreed the entrée's were just okay. The food was hot and plentiful, but was just kind of average in my opinion, not bad but not in a rush to visit again. 

After lunxh we decided to end our meal woth something sweet. For dessert we  had the fried ice cream which  was delicious, the best part of the meal, as we're the chips and salsa.

The service at Manuels is ourstanding.  Our server made sure our chip bowl and glasses were always full before we even asked.  Great service, generous portions, and reasonable pricing.
