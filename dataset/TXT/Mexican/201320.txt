Pjg0ML-Se8fnbWgHHodGYQ I woke up on my birthday earlier this week new to town and craving blueberry pancakes.  We checked the reviews and decided this was the place to try. My breakfast was incredible! My partner had crepes which she described as "ok" and lacking in fruit as they were the "fruit filled" crepes. 
Cons - I ordered diet coke, which they don't serve and she brought me diet Pepsi without asking. NO. I  will have water before Pepsi.  Also I ordered 2 pancakes and was not told it was just over a dollar more for 4, I would have gladly taken the extras home and eaten the next day. As I said they were incredible!
