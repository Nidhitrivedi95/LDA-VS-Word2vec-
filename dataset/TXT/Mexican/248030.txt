U2ifrd_UqIbBNZaHuck5Gw I was so excited to come to this place since I found out they were coming to Laval. The first time I tried to go the line was so long outside that we turn around. This time I came during an off night during the week and it was a good choice because the place was not really busy.

The decor is amazing and the place was pretty clean. The music was very loud actually it was a little too loud because I couldn't hear what my boyfriend was telling or even hear the waitress. The service was pretty slow and it also took a while for us to get an English menu.

Huge drink menu and my man had a beer and I took some kind of pina colada and it was very good. It was cheap fajitas night so my boyfriend tried that and we both loved it. I had a spicy fish taco with a mango slaw and that was amazing as well the only thing I didn't enjoy was that awful rice it was mushy and tasted like tomato. Also love the fact that they have so many hot sauce to choose from right at the table.

I will go back again for drinks and food for sure
