eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg Heard great things about Barrio Cafe, so had to try it. Was disappointed with the food, however this is a regional acquired taste. The molé was dark and had that burnt taste which I don't care for. This type (region) of Mexican food does not appeal to me. The place is clean. Was a bit pricey. The server was average. Nothing wowed me.
