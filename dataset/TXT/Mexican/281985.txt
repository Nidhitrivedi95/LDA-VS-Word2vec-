Walked into Mesa Grill at around 5:30 p.m. on a Wednesday night.  Greeted by a friendly staff and immediately seated.  Our waitress was super nice and sweet!  We were brought three types of bread - jalapeno sourdough, a corn muffin, and walnut raisin bread.  Because I'm allergic to walnuts, they brought us two bread baskets and even cut the bread at a different station to avoid contamination.  Here is a rundown of what we ordered:

Cocktail - Grapefruit (forgot name):  A+

Goat Cheese "Queso Fundido":  A+  -- Melty goat cheese mixed with sweet peppers in a hot cast iron skillet with fresh blue tortilla chips.  yumm

Black Angus Strip Steak:  B -- Large cut of steak, outside was tender but parts were very very tough. 

Mashed Potatoes:  A+ -- Smooth and creamy.  delish.

Ancho Chili - Honey Glazed Salmon:  A+ -- Perfectly cooked medium well.

Smoked Chili Collard Greens:  A+ -- Perfectly seasoned and yummaaa!

We were so full that we couldn't order dessert.  :(  The table next to us ordered a coconut cake that looked sooo good.  Boo...

Overall, great food and service.  4 star rating because of the steak.  At $48 a pop, we would have expected a melt in your mouth experience...
