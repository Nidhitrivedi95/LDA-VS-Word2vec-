8PBq-MHyLDrhkaTf72Foww I want to update my review from several years because The current manager sent a 25$ for me to try the restaurant again, 7 , yes ,7 years later. So that in itself is worth an extra star. 
This time around :
No one acknowledged us when we walked in. We had to seat ourselves. Our waitress was nice and did a decent job. The salsa was good but they charge for chips and salsa and charge extra for more salsa. But the food was good. 
 All in all, it's average ,So that is why my rank is still a 3/5 add an extra star for the manager who is striving for more.
