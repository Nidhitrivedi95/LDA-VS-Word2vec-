2IvrdAb6zdxr3ZqplqJHbg Was "stuck" in Vegas airport on a 4-hour layover (really should have just left the airport and explored The Strip), I was hungry for breakfast and didn't have a lot of options. I have had Tequileria before for a quick quesadilla in-between flights and it's pretty hard to screw up a cheese quesadilla. But today was the first time I actually sat down and ate in the restaurant. 

My server was friendly enough and took my drink order right away (just a glass of water) - but then it was 10 minutes before I saw the water, or her, again. It was breakfast so I ordered the Huevos Rancheros. The food came out fairly quickly. 

The eggs were cooked well, as were the "home fries", but everything else was a mediocre, soggy mess. Too much salsa, cold tortillas, cold beans, and overall a kind of "blah" breakfast. I was hungry so I ate it, unfortunately - then discovered better breakfast options in other terminals of the airport. Live and learn.
