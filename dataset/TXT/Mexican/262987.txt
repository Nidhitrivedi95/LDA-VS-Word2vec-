However; it's well worth the wait and eating outside or in your car. They have a few chairs where you can sit, but its always busy. I like it so much that i don't mind eating standing. I'm giving 5 stars because the food it's just great. Also, because it's hard to find clean, fresh and great food. I live in SW and I dont mind the drive just to get my taco fix.
