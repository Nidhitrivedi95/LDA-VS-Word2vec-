_XN-GwzZwAyIqLKJsl2htg I absolutely love this place. This was one of the first restaurants I came to when I first moved to Arizona and it is still by far my favorite place. When ever I have visitors come to town, this is always the first place I take them too.  I love that you get to order a bunch of small dishes and try so many different things.  The miso eggplant is amazing.  I'm so glad my server recommended it because I never would have thought to order it, and now it is always one of the first things I make sure to order.  Their drinks are also really good, I love the green magic mojito and their seasonal margarita is always amazing.  I highly recommend this place (but not if you're looking for somewhere quiet).
