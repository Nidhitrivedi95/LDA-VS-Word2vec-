XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Took my wife here for her birthday.  We've seen Bobby Flay many times on the cooking channel and wanted to try one of his restaurants.  The service gets 5 stars...the staff is definitely trained well.  We split the bone-in rib eye steak because it was so large.  It was delicious!

The appetizer and salad was nothing special so that's why they are not getting 5 stars for the food.  Overall, I would call it a 4.5 star experience.
