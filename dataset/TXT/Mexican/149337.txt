jslGoWrJQtpC1UgEve0YgA Our first time dining at Comida was well worth it.  A little on the pricier side, however the items we tried were worth it.  The braised short rib was incredible.  We liked the cactus dish as well if for the novelty of it.  My wife ordered the jalapeño margarita which was better than my mango y chile margarita unfortunately.  We enjoyed our time there before heading on to our next destination.  The payment method was obnoxious, but other than that I'd definitely recommend.
