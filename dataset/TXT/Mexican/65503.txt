bAdwf-n52f46-ZjlfJ1Hwg Cheap Mexican food that is delicious!  You get a lot of food for not very much money.  The meat here is good.  I've never had a burrito filled with fatty meat.  But what really makes the burritos good are the tortillas!  I don't know how they make them so good but they are da bomb!!!  The only things that I don't love is the location, in a gas station, and they charge you to use a credit card.
