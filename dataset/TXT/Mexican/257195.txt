The carne asada burrito I had was perfectly fine though the steak chunks were small, slightly bland, and few and far between lettuce galore. I'm not sure if there was any kind of rice or pinto or black beans in the burrito. There was, however, a generous amount of sour cream, which I quite liked.

We shared guacamole as a starter. It was a bit mild but still nice and seemed to be made with natural ingredients. 

Complimentary chips and salsa are always welcome. The chips are wonderful here.
