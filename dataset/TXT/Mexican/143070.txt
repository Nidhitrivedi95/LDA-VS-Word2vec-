JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg Fear not, you're not entering the Sapphires strip club! It is somewhat difficult to see the restaurant since it is attached to the strip club. The restaurant does have a sign on the front of the building, but not on the large sign in the parking lot. This place is open 24 hours, which is very convenient if you would like to have some excellent Mexican food and margaritas late night. They serve only non-GMO and organic foods which is a bold move for a restaurant. It does make the cost a bit higher but the food is definitely worth it. They have tableside ghost pepper salsa. This is not for the faint of heart! It is put into a lava rock bowl for serving. The server told us to watch our eyes while he mixed it, or we would be in pain for a few hours. The blueberry margarita was delicious! They added fresh fruit into the drink. I also tried the quesadilla which was cheesy goodness.
