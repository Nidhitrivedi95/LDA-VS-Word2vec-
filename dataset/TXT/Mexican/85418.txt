DaVTuhzi6EgWStb2eAjNjA Setting the standard for tacos full stop.  Best tacos al pastor I've ever had (and I've had a lot). The shrimp tacos are also fantastic. The chips are fresh and perfectly fried to order. Service was a bit bumpy the two times we went during our short trip, but once was because their Elo system had a meltdown. Will definitely come back.
