0_mJttUgHIzC-NO18gcgBA I was on a business trip checking out Escapology and needed lunch as we were starving. I know there are a ton of options in Vegas but we didn't care to go to a hotel or to the strip. This place was in the same parking lot as Escapology so we took the easy way out. And wow did we luck out. 

I had some slight knocks on the place that keeps it from five star. But I won't even go into those. They were nitpicking at best. 

Note that it is a seafood heavy Mexican restaurant. You can get a standard chicken burrito or steak fajita but you kinda have to dig for it. Everything else was shrimp, fish, swordfish, octopus (seriously). Maybe that's typical out here and Denver Mexican standards just different.  I figured despite the fact we were so far from water I'd go with the Tacos Enchilados de Camarones.  They were amazing. I figure I'd get three basic street tacos, light on ingredients. But no. They were stuffed.  The cabbage and pickled onions were fresh and the shrimp was cooked perfectly.  And there was something different about their taco shells.  I can't explain it, but they were fantastic. 

If you want off the strip and want to avoid overpriced tourist traps, this is your place. Well done!
Service was prompt.
