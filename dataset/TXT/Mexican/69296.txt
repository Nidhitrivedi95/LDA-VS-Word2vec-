bQ2uuNkOxgUQRM7Y7RJDXQ The ambience was nice the patio is cute and a nice little bar area. The food was so so, the beans had a different flavor than Someburros so I was disappointed they weren't the same in taste like the chips and salsa. I ordered the Poblano Relleno and it was okay. The home made tortilla was a nice touch.
