zw9_mqWBn1QCfZg88w0Exg We came here on a Sunday for lunch. 

Boyfriend and I ordered the tableside guac as an appetizer and shared a 3 item combo platter. The guacamole was pretty good, I'll give them that. But our 3 item combo was not. We got one beef enchilada, one chicken enchilada and a shredded beef tamale. And as usual, combo platters come with rice and beans.

My beef enchilada was disgusting!!!! The meat was especially disappointing! Looked and tasted like Taco Bell's taco meat. If I was blind folded and given a taste test, take one bite out of a Taco Bell beef taco and one bite out of Chevys beef enchilada.....I would have guessed both ground beef were from Taco Bell. Ugh...horrible. My boyfriend didn't care too much for his chicken enchilada either. He said it tasted bland. Our tamale was a step above the enchiladas though. They used shredded beef (thank goodness it wasn't that nasty Taco Bell meat). Sauce was flavorful and it was pippin hot. Our enchiladas tasted like they've been sittin' out for awhile. 

We definitely WILL NOT be back. 1 star for the chips + salsa + tableside guac and 1 star for the tamale.
