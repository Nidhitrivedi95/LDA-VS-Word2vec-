The waiter was back and fourth and never offered any appetizers, even the manager when I brought it to her attention still never was asked if we'd like an appetizer. Not my go to place and each visit re enforces why I don't like coming here. Their prices are high, portions are large, but I don't need the size of they're portions. New waitress and we'll see about the outcome. But she's trying; just will not change the out come of this visit.
