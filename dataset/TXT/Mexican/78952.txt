CrwL7Y-jdzno4mmV7CN67A The food is from Central Mexico, which is different than the typical Sonoran fare most are used to.   The same style and quality food, as Barrio Café, but half the price and double the portions.   It's a comfortable and friendly place, still as close to original  (even the cool lighting fixtures) and complete as when it was a Sambos...and that must go back.  Oh, they actually make their generous margaritas with a shaker.
