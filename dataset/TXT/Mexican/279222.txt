Xs37o78aby0o-Wmvh5yYPg TJ's in Olmsted Falls isn't the best place I've ever eaten, but don't get me wrong, the food was outstanding. Yeah, you gotta pay for the chips and salsa, but with the amount of food you get with your entree, you won't even need them. To the reviewer who complained about unfriendly service, you must have been there on an off day. Go sit and the bar and ask for Animal, and I guarantee you'll experience some of the best service you'll ever see. I had the carnitas empanadas. Three huge servings I could barely finish. All made in house, and made by guys who know what they're doing. Don't be afraid to try something new because their house made chorizo is amazing. I, personally, am a trained chef so I judge food harshly, and I was not disappointed at all. Try it. Ask for Animal.
