VMeXFzWwBF2PSHx6EpII4A Being picky about tacos limits my ability to truly enjoy myself when eating what I consider below-average tacos.  These are not those. These street tacos are so very tasty. I tried them for the first time last night and voila! My tastebuds were dancing and I was in a happy place.  Go here and let your tastebuds experience what I too have uncovered. (Really good street tacos - I had the tinga and carnitas. Both were excellent but I slightly preferred the carnitas)
