ZLG7N4VDGzo7V0ViITi93Q Well known for their tortas, of which I've had the famous Del Rey (ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, omelet, sausage, chorizo and all the fixings) I've also been there for their asada tacos. Served platter style, where you build your own, they're paired with refried beans and rice and is quite the serving size. Great spot for a heavy lunch, and their three locations (last I checked) seem to all be on par with consistency, which is great for their reputation.
