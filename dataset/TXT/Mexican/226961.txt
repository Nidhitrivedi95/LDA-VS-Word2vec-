S_bG5WWbtNXhhY9Y0GTcSg I have to say, I am really impressed by this place. My boyfriend and I have certain food allergies and they were very friendly and accommodating about them. Even when the order came out incorrect, my boyfriend and I were very understanding as we know we have a lot food needs. But the chef came out and was very apologetic about it. It was very clear that the chefs here have pride in the food they serve. Besides all that, the food (and the coffee!!) are very delicious!! I highly recommend, not only if you have food allergies, but if you are looking for top notch food and coffee.
