havUcqU5tH0zorHxCxGj8A Our first time here. The service was slow, there was a waitress trying to help out our waiter because he was didn't bring us drinks or salsa and chips because he was to busy mixing up other tables' orders. We finally order our food after what felt like forever. And when we got our carnitas plates it literally smelled like cat food. Didn't look or taste like carnitas so i just ended up not eating it. I had so many high expectations going into this place especially since i'm not from Arizona . But left so disappointed. I would never come here again. Everyone looked like they hated their jobs and didn't want to be there. This is not authentic Mexican food. You'd be better off going to chipotle in my opinion. At least your food wouldn't smell like cat food then.
