FoKx_RP4kUM-aiGo3wlUUw We were exhausted from traveling all day, and  needed to eat!!

The 2 Mexican restaurants closer to our hotel did not have good reviews,  so my wife looked up other locations, and we decided to try this place.
 I am so glad we did! 

We started out with chips and salsa, and a warm bean dip with a little kick. It was excellent! The wife had a house Margarita which she said was super strong. She had fish tacos which she said were some of the best she's ever had. I went with a chicken burrito, and I was very satisfied with it. I would come here again...
