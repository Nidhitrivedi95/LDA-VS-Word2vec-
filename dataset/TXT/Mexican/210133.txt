QMaaLfedGzNhHz6PZKAUkw My friends and I decided that this place would better serve our appetites over McDonalds across the street.  Long story short, we ended up tossing our food in the trash and cruising through the McD's drive through on our way out of town...Frickon sad.  
This place is dirty, the service is trash and the food is gonna get people sick!!! Send in Robert Irvine stat....This place is in trouble.
