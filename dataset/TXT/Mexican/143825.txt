JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg I would hope that the population realizes that Mexican food is comprised of only a handful of ingredients that transform into different named items. Tacos are a tortilla filled with meat, cheese, cilantro, pico de gallo and folded over once. It comes in a hard or soft shell. Enchiladas are tortillas filled with meat with cheese, onions, sour cream etc. Burritos are....you get the idea
El Dorado uses the same ingredients as Robertos except they use different spices and PRESENTATION which makes a big difference not mention that it shares wall space with a gentlemens club ( strippers is the operative word here ) and a wait staff that will kiss your bottom so well you are obligated to leave a nice tip. 
Expensive? Definitely. Prices are almost triple than off strip joints that serve great food. 
Alcohol? Yes, again priced heavily 
Ambiance? It's just ok
Gluten free and something else....I forget. Either way it's an excuse to charge more. It's like overpaying for stuff at Whole Foids because it's organic. 
 Bottom line is I was not impressed with the taste of the food. The presentation was nice. The  fresh guacamole made at your table was good but way overpriced. $16 for three avocados and ingredients. Please. Margaritas were very good even if you only have three sips through a straw before you were finished. They were very strong. 
Would I go back? No!
 If you want to impress visitors from out of town this would be the place to take them. And if you time it just right you might catch a glimpse of a whole table full of strippers I just got off the shift enjoying their shift meal before returning to the laps of luxury next door. 
I'm not trying to be the place up because it is OK. To each his own and all my opinions belong to me.
