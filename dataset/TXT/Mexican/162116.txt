l1GJnB9TJgGgEeI4at1M0A I eat a lot of Mexican as you may be able to see with my reviews. I went with the street tacos and they were the best I've ever had, anywhere, period. I got 4 total- chicken, chocita, pastor, and asada. The chicken tasted like really good chicken. The other 3 were heavenly versions of themselves. 

The place is located in the most unassuming of locations. I pulled up and really didn't think I was at the right place. It's nothing fancy on the outside. Went in and was greeted by who I think was the owner. I believe he goes by Sosa. The customer service was a 10/10- he was super friendly and super personable. He asked me how I found the restaurant and i told him I saw them on Yelp. He joked 'you can't believe everything you read, my friends wrote all of those reviews.' Haha. 

The food was a good as it gets, the prices were very reasonable. 

I'll definitely be back!
