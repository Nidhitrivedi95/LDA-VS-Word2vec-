v7xjDbezQ2xw95itvN244Q Went to lunch.  No lunch specials.  Device so-so.   The shrimp cocktail was horrible.  No flavor.  Shrimp were not deveined and tasted old.  The music was blasting for the liking of the servers and not the customers.  The lemon fish was not good.  I would fire the cook and focus on the customers.  There is much better around the area.
