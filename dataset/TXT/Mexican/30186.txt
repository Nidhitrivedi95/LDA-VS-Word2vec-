46hnat0aLao-qYWZkN9aBg For a place that has been in business for years, this fact amazes me. Service was horrible. Complete cluster of when we could be seated. Finally seated and waited 30 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge we were there. Asked a busboy and waited another 10 minutes. Finally got in a drink order. Had to ask the waiter twice if he could take our food order. He looked like he was HIGH AS A KITE. Food was so-so. Margarita was lame. Service pathetic. WON'T BE BACK. TOO MANY other alternatives in this town.
