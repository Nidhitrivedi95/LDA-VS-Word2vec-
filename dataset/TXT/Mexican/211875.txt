qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A The only disappointment was that the DW does not stand for "DarkWing Duck."

This is a cute little place tucked up on the far southwestern side of Vegas. The DW, as I was told, stands for the first initials of the owners, D and W. I noticed it on a list of restaurants participating in Restaurant Week (a local charity event), and when I got a recommendation from one of my managers, it went on my list of places to try.

But when our crew got there and looked at the regular menu, the prix fix Restaurant Week menu went out the door as we looked at all the tasty brunch options. The eggs were tasty and unique. Scrambled eggs left sitting can get hard and un-delicious. Yes, I said un-delicious. But somehow, the eggs here were softer and tastier than other places. The toast is made from some kind of sweetened bread, and when you top it off with their apricot preserves, it's some kind of wonderful.

Elite Emily had the Jamaican Omlette, and Mama Elite had the New Mexico Pork Omlette. Both were mighty satisfied. Hector stuck with the prix fix Restaurant Week menu, which garnered him some crab cakes with eggs benedict, which looked good.

But here's the kicker: save room for dessert. You must have this carrot cake at DW Bistro. No, really. You must. You should actually go right after this review. Because God bless the person who first created this carrot cake. It uses the standard carrot cake ingredients, plus pineapple, macademia nuts, coconut, with a cream cheese frosting and liberally spotted with fresh berries. It's about the size of a house, so make sure you're sharing.

Holy god it's good. I'm pretty sure I made my O-face at some point.

The atmosphere is nice: it's a quiet bistro in a small spot. The staff was really friendly and attentive. I feel a strong "family" vibe, if you catch my drift.

It's kind of a ways away from me, but I would be totally open to coming back again. Might be a great setting for a date? Just sayin....
