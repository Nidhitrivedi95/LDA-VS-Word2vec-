J5ebC7fKqrSF8KuS8d6hgw I have to give Sierra Bonita a series of third and fourth chances because really and truly, I want to love it.  People that I love and respect love it.  I love the people working there.  I love the potent margaritas.  I adore the decor.  And the menu is sexy and inviting.  But...

I blatantly, completely order wrong when I come here.  To the point that I decided that I might actually hate it.  Like get up and leave mid-bite.  My $16 Cowboy Stew was flavorless and sad - like church potluck beef stew with hominy and soggy fried parsnips as an afterthought.  A sea bass special was described with such a litany of delicious adjectives (saffron, chorizo, porcini mushrooms and poblanos) that one would think that the food would literally sing.  No dice - it tasted like absolutely nothing.  As in not a single taste sensation whatsover - I think I have food in my mouth but I'm not sure...What the heck, Sierra Bonita?  This was approved as a special?

At subsequent visits, I've had the carne asada (toothsome) and the red chile pork (flavorful and tender) and have felt a little better about the place.  Like 3 stars as opposed to 2.  But I don't want you to be just a bunch of hype - I want every single dish on your menu to be a winner so that I can visit your establishment fortnightly (with friends in tow), order fearlessly, and love you forever.  Can you make that happen?
