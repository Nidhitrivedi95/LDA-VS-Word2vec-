jScBTQtdAt-8RshaiBEHgw Awesome place for brunch, kinda bummed about the fact they are not serving dinner for me to try next time. Back to the review, what makes the review a five star is the service and of course the food. The chef always make sure all the food coming out of the kitchen is enjoyed by their servers as he comes out of the kitchen to greet and check service. Very good thing for me as a foodie.... 
We ordered the soft shell benedict, french toast, and a bunch of goody stuff and all is exceptional. This is my new go to place evrytime i get here in vegas. Will follow them when they start serving dinner....more power to the staff and crew of this establishment.
