My family and I came here to have brunch. We all ordered something different so that we can have a taste of each dish. I ordered the purity juice, this was the perfect way to start my day off. I personally like it cold when I drink juice, so I asked for a side of ice. Just makes the raw juice taste so much better when it's cold. I went for the soft shell crab sandwich, this is a must try! It is very tasty and the crab is nice and crunchy. The batter was well made because when I took a bite into the sandwich, you can hear that crunch as you bite into it. Totally recommend this dish if you ever stop by Tableu. 

I also really like how the condiments are all made out of scratch, I mean,,,how many restaurant does this nowadays? Very few I've been to does this, and this is one of them.

Service was great throughout our brunch, would definitely come back next time I'm in vegas!
