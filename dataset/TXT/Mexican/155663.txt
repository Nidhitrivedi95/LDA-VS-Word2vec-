Ka3z0iudeviL2nEKZ4BeYg The inside is generically wacky, as if designed by Martha Stewart after taking peyote. It's complete with made up meal size names, mexican style popart, multi-colored lights, Sugar Ray playing on the radio (yes it was). Customer service is on par with Chik-fil-a, as I had my water filled up and trash taken away, granted I was the only one there at 4pm on a Friday.

The chicken and bean burrito wasn't bad. I did not NOT like it. It's the first burrito I've ever had with olives.

It's great if you want to bring your kids somewhere before grabbing a drink with your bros at Icehouse.
