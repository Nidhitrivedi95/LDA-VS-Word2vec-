XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Went to Mesa Grill on a double-date of sorts with my boy Alby while in Las Vegas for work last week.  I have been to Mesa Grill before, maybe 4 or 5 years ago and remember it being phenomenal.  Food Network celebrity chef Bobby Flay owns the place, and that is a pretty damn good endorsement.  It's also in one of my favorite Vegas spots, Caesars Palace.

We started with a delicious Chicken Quesadilla appetizer, but moved into bigger and better items with the main course...

The girls each ordered the Sixteen Spice Chicken with garlic-mango sauce and buttermilk-chive mashed potatoes.  Alby ordered the Grilled Pineapple Mahi Mahi with green chile rice.  And I had the New Mexican Spice Rubbled Pork Tenderloin with a sweet potato tamale.

We all shared bites with each other.  I thought the Mahi was best, the girls thought the Pork was best.  Alby liked the chicken.  All three items were actually pretty spicy and hot (warning to you wusses out there).  I will say, my sweet potato tamale with pecan butter was untouchable as far as our side dishes went.

Dessert was the only blemish on a perfect evening of dining.  We had the Peach Berry Cobbler, and while it was good... the awful ginger ice-cream really put a strange and unnecessary twist to it.

Overall, five stars and a great place for a good meal in Sin City.  Another bonus is that it is next to the Caesars Sports Book if there is any wait for a table...
