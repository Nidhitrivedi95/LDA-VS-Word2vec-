cRMC2eQ9CP6ivhEY8EdaGg When you have a burrito place whose name literally translates to "crazy Chinese", you have to go inside and see what it's all about. With two locations in Toronto, Chino Locos serves up some unique (and large) burritos that have Asian influences to the filling. One of their most popular uses of Asian ingredients would be using chow mein to stuff the burrito instead of the standard rice. They also have asian themed proteins along with the classic Mexican ones to put in your burrito such as Korean beef or General Tao chicken.

I tried their fish burrito with chow mein and it was interesting to say the least. I like how Chino Locos does not fry their white basa fish, instead they sauté it keeping it tender and flavourful.
