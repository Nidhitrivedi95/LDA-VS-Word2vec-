svdEhLmNmpVaIv1WLtoOvQ I've always came here during the late night on "Taco Tuesday" crowd gets packed outside at night. 

I'm in love with their food! Shrimp taco's is my favorite for sure. I'm not a vegetarian but i heard that the veggie taco was good and it definitely is! 

In the mood for taco's? Check this place out. You won't be disappointed, I'll definitely become a regular customer here :)
