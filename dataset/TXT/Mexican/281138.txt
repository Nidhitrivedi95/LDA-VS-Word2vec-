XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Five stars for food.  We try to get here anytime we are in Vegas.   We always sit at the bar.    This visit we were surprised to discover it was restaurant week with a $50 prifixe menu.  I chose that. My husband chose the regular menu.   After great apps and entrees I was told the only included dessert available was chocolate pudding which I did not want.   

I expected that Donna would see if the chef would offer an alternative.  Instead we were unceremoniously handed our check.   No offer of the dessert menu.  No offer of coffee or an after dinner drink.  More like Don't want the pudding, get out.    

While I won't say this ruined the meal it certainly left us disappointed.
