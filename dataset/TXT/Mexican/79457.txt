cUFBO-5Fgd7pR0JUakWXSw Not impressed -- over priced food and drink service is poor at your table - had to ask the waiter and waitress for my drinks and water . I do like the bar service as we stopped and had a night cap on the way out! 
I will chalk it up to being new . Let's see if there in business in 2 years ? Lots of competition in Scottsdale and Phoenix. Foodies paradise!!!

Love the location in Kierland and good additional much needed restaurant-- The best thing going here is the outside patio seating as the nights are amazing in AZ.
