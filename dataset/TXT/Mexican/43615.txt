7HUEqrj4aa_u3kl-o-e9_Q I've been hearing nothing but raves for the food here in the short time it's been open, so I just knew I'd be stopping by sooner or later.

I arrived around 1:00 on a Friday and the joint was packed. The lineup to order was pretty much to the back of the tiny restaurant and it was as slow moving a line as I can easily recall. (It didn't help that the cashier was indulging many folks' questions and requests for substitutions; look, when you've got this many people waiting to order, it's not inappropriate to adopt the stern tone of the Soup Nazi.)

After what felt like hours, our order was placed and we received the food a short time later. I went with the Cochinita sandwich (Yucatan pulled pork, habanero pickled onion, fried plaintain, refritos) and I'll admit that it was worth the wait.

The pulled pork was tender and flavorful, and the remainder of the condiments proved a perfect accompaniment (I probably could've used just a tad less refried beans, however). The sandwich was also put together really well; given the insane crush of people, I was expecting a hastily-assembled mess but this was a picture-perfect concoction.

I also tried the papitas con chile (house potato chips, lime, chile piquin, salasa picante). These were much, much less successful. The house potato chips were bland and uninspired, and the only sauce I could detect was the salsa picante, which seemed to consist primarily of vinegar. I ate a few and threw the rest away.
