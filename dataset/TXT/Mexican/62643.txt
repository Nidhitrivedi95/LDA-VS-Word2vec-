I had guac, two tacos, and a drink (Tuesday taco night), and have not had anything like it anywhere else.  Every item was uniquely crafted by a chef who colors outside the lines to create familiar food items with a twist that you won't find anywhere else.  Even the chips that came with the guac had a texture and freshly-made flavor that prevents me from comparing it to other restaurants.   You just have to try it yourself to understand.
