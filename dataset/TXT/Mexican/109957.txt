When we asked if we got the right tacos the waitress explained the corn is hit or miss, sometimes you get it sometimes you don't. One taco had two kernels and the other two had zero. She wasn't kidding. The margaritas were okay, I had the caliente margarita but the was no caliente. They also served the margarita in a beer stein. Wasn't at all impressed and the prices are way over what they should be for that type of food. Also the tacos are poorly constructed. They put the shells in the holders and then throw all the toppings across the top so when you pick them up the toppings either fall off or it's only on the center taco. Wouldn't go back and really wouldn't recommend. You're in Vegas, there's an abundance of good Mexican food, save your time, money, and appetite for someplace better.
