SAae44V24aD7y_HpgxjhPA A great local spot for good Mexican food. On our last trips to Mesa we were introduced to, and mafe a return trip to Nandos by relatives who live near by. My wife and I visited again last night and once again was not disappointed. We were seated promptly, our drink order was taken quickly, and chips and 2 salsas were served immediately. The chips @NANDOS is some of the best I've had being thin and browned to a perfect crisp. The salsas are delicious also, with one being "mild" the other being "hot." We chose to share the Carnitas which comes with:  rice, beans, spicy guacamole and your choice of flour or corn tortillas. The Carnitas was tender, juicy and plentiful. The only complaint we had, was it could have had more flavor and less salt, but we didn't complain as we know any restaurant can be off occasionally. Another great meal, at a great restaurant!
