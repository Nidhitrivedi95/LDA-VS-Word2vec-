bgx6gYdktqEoQwBdo5lRbA We had a most marvellous time eating a wonderful dinner last night. I love the whole fried fish fish tacos so popular in Mexico. They make them on request for only $10.99 includes 4 tortillas of your choosing, beverage and all the fixings. Loved the great salsa bar too, also included. 

Just could not be happier. If this was a big fancy place it would be packed always at twice the prices. Loved it.
