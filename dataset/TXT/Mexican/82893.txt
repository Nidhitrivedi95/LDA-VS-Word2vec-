D17zqKVWM5BMC443mDVF4g There should be a button for no stars,  that's what I would give this place. Food took FOREVER, over 40 minutes and when I got my cheese enchiladas the cheese wasn't even melted or warm for that matter.  Full on ridiculous!!  We were the last ones to get our uncooked food even though we were there before other people.  I'm not one to pull the race card but maybe if we were brown it would have been better. We were the only white people in there. Maybe that's why? We will never go here again.
