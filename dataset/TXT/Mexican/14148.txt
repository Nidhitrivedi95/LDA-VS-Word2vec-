0r1Ow0HYAAjU7oM_2ePN6g Location: Great foot traffic location @ Murray/Forbes. Chic and clean. Standing room only w/ 2 tables.

Service: Was not a can-do vibe and didn't sense positive vibes to customers. Man was on a phone call with one hand and crafting my taco with another. Also, called a customer sweetheart which is borderline.

Food: Tacos are $3. Good serving of food and variety in each choice. Fresh ingredients and crunchy veggies. Aroma of seasoned beef added to a good eat.

All in all I recommend if you don't want to walk to Cuzamil on Murray.
