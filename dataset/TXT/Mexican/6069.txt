_Fo8uNT17BEBUkKvUXCZkQ I've been looking for these carne asada tacos in Las Vegas for years. Delectable carne asada tacos, seasoned and cooked well doesn't seem like a difficult order, but I'd given up on trying to find them in this town. I've been to many taco spots and they seem to focus on their pork dishes. The street tacos at La Carreta are flavorful and tender and, yes, greasy. They take a few minutes to come out and they are worth it. The tacos are well priced and the service is always professional.  

Thank you to the other Yelpers who found it for me. I'm glad it's quite a ways from me otherwise I'd be stopping by on a regular basis. I enjoyed their consome, but I'm a creature of habit who is not interested in the rest of the menu. Come here for the tacos. These carne asada street tacos are absolutely as good as it gets in this town.
