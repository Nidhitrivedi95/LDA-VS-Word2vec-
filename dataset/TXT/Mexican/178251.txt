MVSACvnnpDiEDp4FTn1c5A The food is your run of the mill Chipotle stuff which I only get salads these days, having fun and making it fit into my lifestyle...by the way, they have the highest caloric vinaigrette ever!  So if you're on the nutrition calculator before going, don't add it.  Although this was the first Chipotle to ever give me the dressing, never knew that existed!

Now lets get to why this place is poor, the line was long which should say this is worth it.  But no one was sticking around.  There's a reason: 50% of the tables were filthy, the other 50% were occupied and about to be filthy.  Won't be going to this one again, I prefer a hygenic atmosphere.
