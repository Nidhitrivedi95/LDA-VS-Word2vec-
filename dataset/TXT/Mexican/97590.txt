EktALNXpjRIpaiR-cUJ-_g Popped in for dinner the other night before going to see Quirke at the BBC tent.  I had the beef burrito & the OH tried the pulled pork burrito.  We were given a choice of toppings - cheese, salsa, guac, sour cream and sauce.  There were also three levels of sauce to choose from: hot, hotter and outrageous. I'm a wimp at really spicy food so I stuck to the hot sauce, it had a kick but it was a  tasty "gentle nudge" rather than " blow your head off"  level of chilli.
Whilst I really enjoyed the flavours in my burrito it was pricey for the size of the portion. The beef burrito was £6.50 and the pork one £6.00 so definitely festival prices. I could've eaten two and I suspect the OH would've had three if we'd had the time. As it was we ended up going elsewhere to get more food.
Great for lunch or a snack, not enough for dinner.
