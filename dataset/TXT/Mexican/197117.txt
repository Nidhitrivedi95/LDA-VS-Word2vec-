OxSaGGTmIujsjDpDqwyGPQ Love this place ! As soon as you walk in you are greeted by friendly staff and told you can sit where ever you like. They have tons of decorations on the walls - plastic lizards and vines and other Mexican decor which only adds to the charm and authenticity IMO. The food is FANTASTIC I've tried most of the combos. The staff is extremely friendly and willing to answer any questions. They also have deep fried ice cream! They are Definitely my go-to Mexican restaurant because of how authentic everything tastes.
