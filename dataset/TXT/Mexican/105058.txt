FI-8LPGkc8D_hwx0l0zyyg Went here for dinner with 3 others. The salsa served as soon as you sit down is so good. We got guac and queso and those were delicious as well. I got the watermelon, mint margarita which was very refreshing and great for a hot day. My main meal was the pork tacos. Meal was very filling and couldn't actually finish it all. Laid back atmosphere and friendly wait staff. Meal was served quick and I have no complaints and would definitely come back!
