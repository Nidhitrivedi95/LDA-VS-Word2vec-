F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw This place was in a word, fantastic.  I had the sofrito green beans and the carnitas tacos.  Both were out of this world.  But what set this place above the rest was the chips and guac.  Not that they had them and that they were fantastic, which they were, by the way.  But what happened during our experience. 

I met my brother and his girlfriend up there before meeting up a group of people for a party. While at the bar, I had some of their corn chips and guac.  Heavenly.  But when we got to the table, the server informed up they had run out of the corn chips but were hand making flour chips.  While they weren't the same as the corn chips they were still pretty good and way better than anything you'd get in store.  She also informed us, that due to the chip shortage they had actually closed early and that we were the last table of the night!

After hearing about our disappointment about the chips, the chef came out when our food came out and apologized about the shortage.  We was very sincere and it was great knowing that some chefs still care about the quality of product they put on the table.  It's that sort of attitude that'll keep me coming back, again and again.
