First, it took some time for the waiters to take our drink orders. Keep in mind that most of the cocktails cost closer to $9 per drink for a small glass size (not exactly the best price per drink value). 

We ordered plenty of appetizers of chips and fries for the table and finished it quickly, and then began the long wait before our order was taken for our entrees. Keep in mind, the rest of this place isn't even crowded! 

When our food finally arrived, I was quite disappointed in the portion size of the Breakfast Bowl that I ordered. The quality of food wasn't awful, but I couldn't even finish it since it just wasn't any good. 

As for the checks, it was another wait game, and before we know it, we were asked to leave since the store was closing in five minutes. Quite honestly, I probably wouldn't take the time out to come back here given the slow service and the poor quality of the meal.
