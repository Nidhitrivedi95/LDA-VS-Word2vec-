FI-8LPGkc8D_hwx0l0zyyg Everything was okay.  And only okay.  Except the Iced Tea, that was really good.

It wasn't that busy.  Seemed well staffed.  Food was okay, More expensive than expected once it was delivered.  Mole is more like a stew, beef tacos a lot like beach tacos. Not dressed particularly well.  Nothing delivered to the table without asking.  Sometimes twice.   

Service was very *meh*.  Server did't actively refill glasses, didn't get new silverware immediately when someone dropped theirs...didn't deliver dinners together, didn't do anything that wasn't asked.

I won't avoid it.  I won't seek it out or suggest it, either.  Just okay.  All of the dishes were just okay.
