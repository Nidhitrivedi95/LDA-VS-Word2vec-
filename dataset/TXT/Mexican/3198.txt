First off, chips were freshly fried and not greasy. The salsa was good too. For lunch, I ordered the chicken flautas lunch with rice and beans. It was very flavorful with a kick. I had no idea it was going to be spicy at all, but I like spice, so it was fine with me! 

For dessert, we decided on the sopapillas which were served with honey. The sopapillas were light and fluffy and not at all greasy. Add some honey, and it was a perfect ending to a good Mexican lunch.
