7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA Granted I haven't been to every single brunch spot in Toronto, this would have to be my favourite for food, the service was good, not mind blowingly amazing but definitely good enough especially given the fact that the line up outside since we came on what I would imagine is the busiest day...Sunday. I'm OK lining up for food especially for one that is this good. And even if the line was a horrible experience, that's in no way a reflection of Lady Marmalade. We did have a lady pull over in a truck and shout at the line in general about what was going on, when she heard it was a restaurant she just drove away looking very puzzled. So I guess not everyone has heard about the lady yet.....(I don't know if anyone refers to this place as "the lady" but I just did). 

While in line, I took to yelp to see if it could help sway me with deciding what to get since most of the menu stood out to me as "oo I want that one!" after browsing for a few I decided to go for the much raved about eggs benedict with avocado and brie. Ended up being a great choice so thank you yelp for yet another fantastic reco! The food was just great, the eggs were perfectly runny and everything was just great. My brunch date got the huevos rancheritos, I'm not the biggest fan of Mexican food so in my mind I chose the better dish, but she still loved her selection. I got black coffee, that got refilled once (which was enough) and she had a delicious OJ with what tasted like lime in there too?

Overall, this place is definitely worth a wait...we were in line for around 40 - 50 minutes I think. But it's not like I had any other plans, but for repeat visits I would definitely try to come back on a day that's not the official day for brunch in the city.
