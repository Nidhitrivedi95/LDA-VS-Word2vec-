PgdQrTSOX132EgNj8VPNlg Stopped in for a nightcap. Good food options and bar offers something for every craving.  Went with their top shelf margarita...fresh tasting (read: no premix taste) and the boneless wings. Go southwest style for something different. Atmosphere is open and bar staff is friendly!  Adding this to my list of places to visit next time I'm in town.
