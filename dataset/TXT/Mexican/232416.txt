Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg A couple of weeks ago, a friend and I came for dinner.  All I can say is....The service was excellent!  From the time we entered the door and was seated, to the time we order our food. Our waiter Mario was very friendly and attentive to what we were ordering. He suggested I order the enchiladas with the green sauce....I must say, that was a very good choice!! The food is very delicious!! Whenever our glasses were running low, they refilled right away. 

I would suggest Lindo Michoacán to all of my friends!   Everyone was so friendly, until the time we left. You're greeted upon arrival and open the door for you as you're leaving and suggest, to have a goodnight with a smile!!
