ms7cmWkPiSBDTnz-1sv2kQ I've been to Ticoz on several occasions (but not in several months), and the food has always been good, and the drinks have always been better.  So my friend and I decided that we would go there for happy hour on Friday.  We pulled up to the valet (since when does Ticoz have a valet) at 5:45pm, and were told by the valet that they were full.  When I asked him where are customers supposed to park, he just shrugged his shoulders.  Really?  I'm confused.  If the only parking you have is in the lots right next to and in front of Ticoz, then why do you need a valet?  Isn't the purpose of a valet to make it easier for patrons to park?  Shouldn't the patron be able to park in front of Ticoz and the valet then parks the car across the street, or down the street, or wherever the restaurant has arranged for additional parking?  If the valet is only parking cars in the lots adjacent to the restaurant, I don't understand the point.  

That left a bad taste in my mouth, and I won't be visiting Ticoz again anytime soon.
