IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA So for our anniversary dinner my husband takes me here. This is the absolute worst place ever.... over priced.. non Mexican restaurant ever.. service was ok. Not too pleasant but it was ok. We left took the food to go and gave away to a homeless person... walked down the strip to a nice Mexican restaurant well see how it goes ... praying Yolos is better food quality
