Wcw-xq_c89e4AaRsUtkaLw I was visiting from out of town here after work with my coworkers.  
Nice place, food was pretty good.  I got the BBQ Peach Pork dinner WOW I was impressed!  I'd get it again, pork was thick soft and juicy.  Greens were not overly cooked and flavorful, the relish on top was cold and fresh and the mash potato was thick and creamy not like out of a box taste.  The apps were good and the drinks were even better.  We ordered and shared (2) slices of pecan pies, it was warm and a lot of pecans yummy!
Staff was friendly and helpful of the menu.
Since I was visiting, I'd go back and try other things.  My coworkers enjoyed all the "pork" orders more flavorful than the beef.  Tacos were good.  Not fond of paying for chips and salsa though.  I would think it comes with ordering a meal.
