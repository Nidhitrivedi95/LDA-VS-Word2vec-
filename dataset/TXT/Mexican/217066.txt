R7LyTeiOHLyTNkA8HssBRQ Los Tacos could be a fast food place to some but not to me. I consider places like Mickey D's and B-king to be fast food and the main reason is because most of their "food" is mechanically processed and frozen... and that's the definition of fast [unhealthy] food.

LT on the other hand does have a drive-thur but they are not fast and their food in my experience has always been very fresh. I usually get 2 chicken tacos that come in a corn tortilla which includes beans and I add avocado and skip the cheese. This little meal is about $7 and you can't go wrong with that.

I ordered this yesterday and I still had a 10 minute drive home and was wowed at the fact that when I got home my meal was still hot enough that I didn't need to reheat... Yay!

In a nutshell I like this LT location because they are faster than the one on Charleston near bruce and they've never miss up on my order. Hooray for Los Tacos all the way around!
