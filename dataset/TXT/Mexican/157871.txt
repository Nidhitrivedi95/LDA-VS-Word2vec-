knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw New to Cleveland and was curious about this place each time I walked by. I love Mexican food, and was almost keeping this as a little present to unwrap at the right time. 

My boyfriend and I peeled back its paper veil last night, and I wish it had come with a return gift receipt. He was excited to try the shark taco, but they were out of it. I had the carnitas taco - the pineapple mixed with pork was not a bad combination- Not unpleasant, not worth going back for. The guacamole was bland - 0 seasoning. A novice in the kitchen could pull something with more flavor together. I tend to judge my Mexican restaurants by the guacamole. 

To add to it, the service from our original bartender was terrible. He was rude. There was another bartender who thankfully made up for the original Ambassador. Lastly, our drinks were the wrong price - 2nd bartender fixed it, which was nice but it just kept spiraling.

I was a little embarrassed as this was my suggestion. Barrio is close by ... I would suggest going there instead.
