THcAGc-Fb8gqmA1V-KvFkw I know a lot of people like this place! To me it was just okay. I honestly didn't feel it was worth the price. The drinks were extremely expensive & no options to make it a meal we had to buy everything individually. Not to mention a shirtless tweaker was waving his finger in a no gesture at the restaurant window.
