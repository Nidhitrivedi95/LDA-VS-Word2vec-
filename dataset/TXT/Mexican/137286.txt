IS-jwE9elsIZ0o1l3a1ILw Went there for dinner tonight sat in the drive thru for 20 minutes. Ordered the beef chimi and it had hardly any meat in it, if I wanted a fried tortilla with onions I would have ordered that but I ordered a beef chimi. Very disappointed as the breakfast burritos are amazing, will just have to go somewhere else for dinner next time I'm craving a beef chimi.
