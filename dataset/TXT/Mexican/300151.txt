zMfZLd5_h5W8ZVxTNoeJyQ The only reason I'm giving this place a three star rating is for the atmosphere and the happy hour specials! The rooftop is so fun to hang out with family and friends, and during the week their happy hour is awesome! It's $3 glasses of wine and $5 specialty cocktails, which is an awesome deal. I've had the food, and it was absolutely average. Nothing to rave about, because it was kind of bland. However, I'll definitely go back for the good atmosphere and the drinks!!
