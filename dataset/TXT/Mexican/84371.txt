d7MApy1gIfSYZzVzUUsf8A The employees are nice here, but this is the pokiest Taco Bell I've ever been to. I come to this particular location at least once a week and always order inside. Every single time I have had to wait an excessive amount of time for a pretty small, simplistic order. Seems like maybe they're understaffed and they ignore the interior to focus on the drive through? Either way, it's rather ridiculous.
