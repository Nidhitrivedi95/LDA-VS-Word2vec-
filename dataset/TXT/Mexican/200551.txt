pEH8XwiyGOe1t7GlboAgGw I was looking for an upscale restaurant for date night and my boyfriend loves Mexican, so why not? Started off with some drinks while we waited for our table. Their drink menu is quiet extensive (especially if you love tequila). 

So now food.... we started with the guac and chips and empanadas - the guac had a nice twist with pomegranates and the chips were made in-house, yum!

For our entrees, I got the rajas poblanos (technically an appetizer but was told it was big enough to be an entree) and my boyfriend got the chipotle arrachera (steak). When the dishes arrived, I was surprised to see that my 'entree' was double the size of the steak dish (literally double - my dish came with 4 tortillas and the steak dish only came with 2) but only half the price. 

Regardless, the rajas poblanos was creamy and rich - one of the most delectable tacos I've ever had. Now on to the chipotle arrachera tacos... neither of us were very impressed with the taste or size of the dish, it was very meh to us and I regretted ordering it. 

Overall, the service was great and the ambiance is intimate. I enjoyed our food, but nothing really excited us enough to warrant a second visit.
