EDg6FM7MYcNMoqrSoWXUUw Freaking awesome. So happy to have this place like 500 feet from my house. 

Stopped in on a hot night for the pop-up and was not disappointed. Tried one fish taco, one beef and one chicken. Every one was amazing with the perfect amount of spice. The fish was the best -- next time I would get all three as fish. Fresh, no fishy-taste and perfectly fried. The toppings just made it even better. 

The owner, Zach is awesome and really friendly. You can also tell he is working so hard -- when we were there he was doing it all and still making conversation with everyone that came in. I'm excited for this place to officially open but at the same time I don't want the secret to get out too much! 

Reasonably priced, delicious, quick and close by -- I'll be back a lot!
