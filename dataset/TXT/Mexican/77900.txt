cKRGB46UJp3z3TgVlzk4tw I cannot figure out why there are so many negative reviews. People are complaining about it not being authentic Mexican (or Tex Mex). That is not what they are trying to be. They have a couple of Mexican style tacos, but they specialize if fish and seafood tacos. My wife and I only discovered this place about a month ago, about a month after opening, and we've been back three times. We've had the Scottish Salmon, Soft Shell Crab, Roasted Lamb Chili Verde, and the Adobado Beef Brisket. Loved them and am looking forward to trying more of their 19 different tacos. We also love the Appetizers. We've had the Crispy Pork Belly, Albacore Tartare, Scallop Ceviche, and Mussels. Loved them too. If you're looking for traditional Mexican that's fine, but this isn't the place. My wife and I search out new experiences and tastes. This place fits.

Many of the complaints are about the wait times, but I like to unwind after work, not be rushed. Again, this place fits that. We haven't felt ignored or that things were taking too long. We have been served by John, the bartender twice know. Once at a table and once at the bar He is very accommodating, even when he's busy. I find this place relaxing, and we like the atmosphere. The outdoor patio is great when the weather is nice. It's so nice to have a unique option for dining so close to us in Peters. We will go back again soon.
