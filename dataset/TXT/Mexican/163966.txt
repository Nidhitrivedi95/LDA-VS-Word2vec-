LGEIsxeJQATo9J1IA-TEdA Best fajitas I have ever had!  Mmmmmm!  We have never ordered anything other than the 1/2 pound of chicken, shrimp and beef.  We typically have enough left-overs to make 2 more meals for each of us.  The tortillas are made in the back of the restaurant if you want to watch.  The lady who makes the tortillas is very nice and will often make one for my daughter right there and give it to her.
The margaritas are very strong and very good.  They go down very well with dinner.  
This restaurant can be a little spendy, but worth it because of the left overs.
Also, be sure to ask for more tortillas to take home for left overs, the staff is always happy to give more.
**Make sure you order the fajitas.  After all, the restaurant's name is Fajitas, not Enchaladas, or burritos.... do not order anything non-fajita...yuck!
