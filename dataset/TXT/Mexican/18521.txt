1n3hAKaOajANcMQZOt1IOg Good food!  I have had there food through the company I work for during our monthly sales meetings when they cater through Manuel's.  I picked up the food this time and was told it would be ready by 5:45.  I arrived at 5:45 to pick up food to feed 20 guys and it was ready to load.  I was greeted very positively right when I walked in and left with a friendly smile.  Good experience.  Thank you!
