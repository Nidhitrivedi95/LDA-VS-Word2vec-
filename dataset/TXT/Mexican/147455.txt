I had some high expectations with my first foray into Tex Mex. San Antonio's has a many things working in its favor: cheap drinks, wonderful staff and nice vibe inside. 

Somehow the food just missed the mark. The chips were cold and salsa was bland with no kick. The inexpensive margaritas were too sweet/sour and was lacking in the booze category.  I ordered the Seafood taco's which looked great had no flavor what so ever.

I am not sure if it was an off night but SA sure fell below expectations.
