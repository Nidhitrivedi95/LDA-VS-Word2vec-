Jy40ercZIQaNcz2qV3qgow This place is WAY too outdated. I am really surprised they can afford to be in a downtown-ish location. They weren't busy when we walked in on a Friday evening. And, their prices are crazy for the non-ambiance they create. I can pay $20+ for fajitas in a nicer, more inviting setting. I'm shocked if college students (or anyone, really) patronize this place much unless they offer half off meal specials- eek!

We reviewed the menu ahead of time on their website and when we actually visited (after a 30 minute drive) we were disappointed they didn't offer what we intended to order. We left- if the setting is lacking and quite dated, I don't want to know how the food tastes. 

The best thing about this place was the friendly and pleasant staff.
