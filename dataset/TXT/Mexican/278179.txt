xLy3aWEbtpoUSVdjuHBS0A Yum!  I was sooo bummed out when I found out that Don Jose's Mexican Restaurant in Robinson closed, but I have found a place just as good, maybe better!  I have been here four times in a couple months.
The chips and salsa are ok, chips are unsalted thick corn and salsa is smooth and mild, with a cilantro kick, and they're free!  The fajitas are delicious!, lots of peppers and onions, we get the mixed steak and chicken, they are equally good. But they only give you 3 tortillas, and you could probably make four or five decent fajitas from what they give you.  The quesadillas are the best!  I don't know how they make them, but they have a buttery/almost toasted marshmallow flavor that is to die for!  The burritos are good, just meat and onions inside.  The rice has a delicious flavor on its own. The table next to us got the handmade tableside guacamole, and they said it was very very good!  
The service was excellent, refills came quickly.  The check could have come sooner, as I've read in other reviews.  Maybe they don't want to rush you?  If you were in a hurry, I would let the server know.  
This place is pretty busy and there are usually lots of Latino people in here, which I think is a good sign.
A warning about the fried ice cream, it's a toasted coconut crunch coating that wasn't very crunchy.  I was expecting a cinnamon crunch coating like Chichi's used to serve and was disappointed.
