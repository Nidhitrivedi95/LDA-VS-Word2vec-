HkbNItNrnXlNo59M0YyoMg Service was Horrible. Too bad because the food wasn't too bad. Waited 10 minutes for our waitress to show up to take our drink order. Twenty five minutes later had to go to the bar to get a plain diet coke. She finally showed up with chips and salsa and 45 minutes to finally get our food after we had to make a second trip to the bar for a couple bottles of beer at which time we were handed the one that had been sitting on the bar waiting for the waitress to pickup. Needless to say no tip.
