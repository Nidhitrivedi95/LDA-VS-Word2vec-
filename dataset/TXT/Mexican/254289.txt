v57Aq8TlBOrzo2j4SSpWCg My second time coming to Limon, and like each time, it doesn't leave much of an impression on me. 

The food is not the best, but I've only tried the tacos here, and they are okay. They are also really pricey and perhaps the ambience is just a bit loud and too dark.  The first time I came to this place, we had such a difficult time reading the menu, that each of us (5 total) had to take the candle close to the menu to read what it said.  

Also of note: there is an ad on the back of the menu. Yes, that's right there is an ad on the back of the menu.  I draw attention to this only because the decor of the restaurant is quite modern and tasteful. The menu is set to be something of moderate-pricey,  The clientele seemed to be touch classier than casual dressers. The appearance of the ad on the back of the menu, is so out of character and doesn't fit in. We concluded that they must be trying to help out a family member or close friend because selling ad space would be down right tacky.

Now, having said all that, I found myself going back to it, because of proximity and as I said, their food is okay.
