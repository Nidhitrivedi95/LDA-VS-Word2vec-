O_UC_izJXcAmkm6HlEyGSA Playa Cabana seems to be on par with Grand Electric in terms of actual mexican and taco authenticity style but is a little more stuffy with the Yorkville crowd flocking here young and old. Where as Grand Electric is a little more Parkdale trendy, fun, laidback and gritty. I came on a Sunday with my boyfriend with no reservations and had to wait for about 35 minutes. Definitely make a reservation as this place is busy. 

We shared  tacos and some guacamole. Like I said, Playa serves some tasty tacos but they come a  little too fussy as I like my mexican simply authentic. Service is decent, our waiter seemed to be a little absent minded but he made up for it in apologetic charm. The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because it also seems to be the most expensive in the city for what you get. Not quite worth it in my opinion.
