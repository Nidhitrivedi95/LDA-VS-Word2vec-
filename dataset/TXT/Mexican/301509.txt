ZtdCS8XjmL4P6BvMOIQWag I love this place.  I like the flavor better than Chipotle. I always get a Shrimp bowl.  I love their little sweet potatoes and their homemade ranch is delicious. They run a clean operation, only problem is the employees aren't very friendly typically.  I go about twice a week and have no plans of stopping.
