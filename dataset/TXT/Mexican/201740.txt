plHKBwA18aWeP-TG8DC96Q I miss this being BYOB. 
That being said...
Try their entire menu. THEIR ENTIRE MENU. 
The special taco you're not sure about? ORDER IT. 
The rib taco, GET IT.
The brisket? Eat it up!
The mac and cheese, the beans, the jalapeno slaw, the queso... ORDER IT UP!

You want to stuff yourself full of this food. You want to bask in the warmth that is their decor.
You need to. 

That aqua fresca? Nothing is better on a summer day.
Fresh squeezed lemonade? You'll never have something more thirst quenching, it's like drinking a cool river of love while standing on the sun. You feel me? 

The wait staff is kind and attentive. 
Be like me, make friends with your neighbor and they may offer you some of their beans that you didn't order and now regret that decision.

I have been here 3 times so far, each time is even better than the last. 
THEY ARE CASH ONLY, BE PREPARED, BRING ENOUGH FOR A TIP, TAKE OUT THE EXTRA 20, YOU'LL THANK ME YOU DID.
