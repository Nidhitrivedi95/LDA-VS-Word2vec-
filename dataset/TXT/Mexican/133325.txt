iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg Really small store with a variety of tacos. Tried the spicy shrimp and Baja fish. Their fresh papaya juice was fresh, and the papaya meat were chopped up into little pieces. Love their hot sauce. The dressing on the shrimp was a bit too heavy/ cheesy for me, I didn't really enjoy that one. The fish was great though. I didn't really like their tortillas though. I presume it's freshly made with corn flour but it has a distinctly dry maize flavour that I don't like. For that reason I don't think I would be back any time soon.
