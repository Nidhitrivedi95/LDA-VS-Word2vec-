YcGHCoSkl2PLKsHQCiu0HA Great inexpensive Mexican food. Dollar chicken tacos on tues. Better for take out as the dining room is small. They also serve posole everyday, which was surprising. Can't wait to try the enchiladas and their Spanish rice. The area has some shady looking people so watch your back.
