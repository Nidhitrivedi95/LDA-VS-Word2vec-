ymyEH_7lZV1ytVsSUGcsag Hmmmm. I'm from California and have really high expectations for mexican food.  As one of the newer mexican restaurant in the area I was never really intrigued enough to stop in. My dad actually found a 20% coupon in the mail so we decided to go up there to eat, have a couple drinks, and watch the game.  

The greeter was very kind and our server was very enthusiastic, but my dad was quite upset when he found out they didn't serve beer nor did they have a Sunday liquor license.  While waiting for the food I noticed a couple of the guys chasing each other and whipping each other with towels (quite unprofessional). 

At last the food came out after about 15 minutes.  My enchiladas were pretty good, but my dad was claiming his beef tacos were on the saltier side.

All in all... Mediocre place nothing that really stood out...mediocre food and mediocre service. Good for a quick takeout meal on ur way home.
