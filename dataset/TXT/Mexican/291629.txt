Highlights:
- Shrimp chipotle taco: plump shrimp with tons of flavor with a bit of a kick. 5 stars.
- Duck carnitas: duck confit on top of 3 tortillas to make your own. It had a blackberry sauce on the side but it didn't even need it. Duck was flavorful on its own. 4.5 stars 
- Guacamole: very fresh, bit smaller portion compared to other spots. 4 stars 
- Cucumber jalapeño margarita: loved the balance of heat and soothing coolness. 2 sizes: tiny of pint glass. 5 stars 
- Quesadilla: was my kids order but all of us were jealous. The tortilla looked awesome and melty cheese busting out. 5 stars
- Full tortillas as chips: fun to have these large crispy saucers. Only concern was the inequal spicing: some had none--great for my son--and some were covered in it.
- Salsas: had a spicy tomato and a mild thicker mole which was a great twist. 4 stars

Midlights; 
- Carne asada tacos: just ok. Everything else was outstanding, so just ok stood out a bit. My hub ordered these and stole some quesadilla and duck.

Lowlights:
- Parking: gets a bit crowded in this outdoor mall spot 

Really enjoyed this place for a nice dinner and would come back.
