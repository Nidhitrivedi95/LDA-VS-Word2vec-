T2tEMLpTeSMxLKpxwFdS3g We were visiting Charlotte from out of town and came to Cabo on Saturday night for dinner... they quoted us a 30-45 min wait, so we went across the street and grabbed a beer. And they called us right away to get seated! So our wait was really only 5 min... but we weren't ready to sacrifice our beers - Cabo was understanding and put us at the top of the list when we finished and came back. Inside is loud, and they were busy! There were big groups there, and mostly younger people/couples but also families. 

Ok no beating around the bush: THE CRAB DIP! We all agreed that this hands down was the best dish we had all weekend. The warm semi-soft/semi-fried pita chips were so perfect and the dip was so tasty! We were still talking about this days later. The chips were so so good and come with a corn pico. I was honestly full before dinner. Margaritas were tasty, not all that strong though. 

I think our server forgot about us or forgot to put our order in because we waited an uncomfortable amount of time before our food came out. My friend (Charlotte resident) said food is usually super quick to come out! So our service was a little disappointing. 

I ordered the fried fish tacos Because the restaurant is called Cabo Fish Taco so how could I NOT order a fish taco! Crispy and HUGE! I had to take a whole taco and most of my side home. I had the avocado pasta salad, which was decent. I don't really think it's "spicy" as it's named. There were just large chunks of jalapenos that gave it a kick but 95% of it was just a regular pasta salad! People on Yelp seem to love it but it was pretty ordinary to me! My date and friend loved their steak tacos! Definitely a good value for the quality/quantity of food that you get!
