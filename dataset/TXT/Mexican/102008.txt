exQYW8jMzBrgGa3Rks8AzQ Zero of five stars! If you are not starving and you have the chance to pass by the restaurant  do it. There are a plenty of very nice places nearby where you are really welcome. The chef was very rude as the people said before. Before we went to the restaurant we looked in the internet for the dishes. The one i did choose was not on the menue so I kindly asked if the dish is available. She said no, the internet shows the full menu but currently we have a summer menueso I did choose sonething different. So far so good. My friend asked kindly to replace one ingredient (ground beef instead of shrimp) and the waitress answered  no, the chef does not like to change things, it is not possible. The soup he wanted to order from the menue was not available also. So we said to her kindly that we need more time to chose something different. She went away and a minute later the chef came to our table. He told us very rude that this is the summer menue and only the dishes listed there can be ordered. And also no ingredient can be changed because everything is fresh madewhat kind of a logic. He really shouted on us so we were stunned. He did not gave us the feeling we are welcomed at all. So if you have a chance to go somewhere else  pass this restaurant and go somewhere else! We went to a restaurant nearby and it was a differnt world! Cochina Mexicana  zero of five stars!
