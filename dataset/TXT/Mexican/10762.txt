Heard about this place numbers of times, happy I took the time to make it by.  The scenery of this restaurant is very cool!  Open, beautiful colors, simple designs.  We sat at the bar, seats were very comfortable (cushioned) and they have big screen projection tv's. 

The vibe here is very laid-back yet spunky and vibrant! I can see coming here for a Saturday/Sunday brunch with family and friends.  Also for any big game whether it's football or basketball-I can see this place filling up quick with sport fanatics. It has different dynamics to complement different personalities and with that being said this place is definitely an original restaurant that is one of it's kind.
