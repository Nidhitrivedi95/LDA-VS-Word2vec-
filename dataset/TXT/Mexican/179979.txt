N_lMOTsjqshTluB83cfC0w We had been excited to see what went into the old Binkley's and this place was better than we hoped ! I love more upscale Mexican and I couldn't be happier to have this in our area! We started with the queso fondido which was simply delicious. My fiancé got the carne asada tacos which were a hit and I got the avocado lime salad with chicken. The chicken on my salad was cooked perfectly and I loved the vinaigrette. Typically when I try to order salads at Mexican restaurants they always have something deep fried or greasy and this salad was just the opposite. 

One con was we felt their homemade chips lacked salt
