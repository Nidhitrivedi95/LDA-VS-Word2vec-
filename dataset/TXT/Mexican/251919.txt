uQdk6xm0TE4qji48yysRDA Going to have to downgrade my previously glowing review. Ordered the exact same 3 tacos I had previously; chicken Tinga, beef Barbacoa and carne Asada. 

This time around the meat portions were meager and small. The beef in the Asada was no longer full chunks but thin slices that were dried out. The Barbacoa was OK and the Tinga was also OK. 

That said the toppings were also non existent AND the tortillas for my tacos were soggy and falling apart. 

I had high hopes for this place but day staff don't seems to have much passion for what they're doing as the original staff did. 

This was an OK experience. Not one I would travel 40 KM for as I did today 

Hoping they turn this around
