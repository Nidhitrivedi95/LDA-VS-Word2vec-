lveadz48Q0_ke_p80D2rhg this is my last vegas review. the entire weekend while in vegas i was in the mood for mexican so we decided on la isla for dinner on sunday.  the food is way better than dos caminos! i ordered the fish tacos and mr h ordered the isla burrito (carne asada filet mignon).  i seriously had entree envy! i did enjoy my entree but his was tasty! next time i might order the burrito and then walk it off on the strip. everything was fresh and service was great!  the only reason i am not giving them 5 stars is because they only offer "tap water" or you have to purchase a bottle of water.  why don't they have filtered water since they do serve soda? the pics did not come out that great since it's so dark in the restaurant.
 
when i arrived to isla for dinner i couldn't get madonna's la isla bonita song out of my head !  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7RJD-2V0b0
