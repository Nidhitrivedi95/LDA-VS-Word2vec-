GETVAz5SCk8rFziexV54Aw I have no idea how this place has 4 stars. People must have terrible taste in food quality. The place was completely empty because the food is terrible. Do NOT get the queso fundido. EW. It was like they stuck a mozzarella cheese stick in the microwave and put it on a plate (before it was even done melting all the way). We ordered the chicken tomatillo enchiladas and chicken fajitas. Again, EW. Aside from it tasting terrible, the chicken looked really scary. The service was absolutely terrible. We watched our waiter just sit behind the bar on his phone while we waited for the check for like 20 minutes. We will never be back here. Don't waste your time either.
