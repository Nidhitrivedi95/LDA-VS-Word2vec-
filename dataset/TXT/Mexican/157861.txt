We went on a Tuesday, anticipating their Taco Tuesday specials.
They sat us in the back of the restaurant, and it wasn't until we ordered food that we found out you can only get the special tacos and half off margeritas in the bar.  I wish they had asked  before they sat us.
I ordered a steak nacho to share - it was delicious!  Should have stuck with that.
My entree was the Enchilada Tinga Poblano.  The carnitas was dry and not very flavorful. Charro beans were nothing special.  
Others ordered various ala cart items.  No one was impressed.
One saving grace - the rice was terrific!  
So, I can recommend the steak nachos and the rice.
