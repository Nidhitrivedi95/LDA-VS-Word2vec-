Gr-2oBg4XyduSKbvnE-i9g Our great experience began by being seated outside on the nice patio with great misters--a real treat for rain-soaked Seattleites!  Our waiter, Ben, was amazing and treated 7 old ladies like we were as worthy of good service as the other young customers having a good time. He took our orders promptly and accurately, and was most accommodating of our special requests. The food came promptly, every order was done to order, hot, fresh and DELICIOUS!!  Really a great experience--hope to see you again next year Ben--thanks again!!
