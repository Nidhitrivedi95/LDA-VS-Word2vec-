PQWE8a6Opjiuzt7DaX2R6Q We are new to Phoenix & have been looking for a good Mexican Restaurant. Blue Agave was recommended and we were not disappointed. The taquitos were hot, crunchy and totally delicious, as was the fish tacos and crunchy tacos. We will eat there again and will recommend to friends.
