INzLc1Y0JNQzIHjPH2Nbeg My first time in and I found the menu affordable and appealing. I ordered chicken nachos to watch during the Patriots game.  I ordered a taco and an enchilada for my husband along with a chicken sandwich for him to take to work tonight.  Everything tasted great! Nice and clean and a very friendly staff.  My new go-to taco shop!
