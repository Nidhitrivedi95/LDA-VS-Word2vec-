vHt0CSynqesXox-9nBj7uA 3 of us visited (2 adults & 1 child) the day before Mother's Day and I got a certificate for being a Mom.. Yayyy me!  It was our first time at OTB and the food was excellent.. Staff was very friendly from the moment we came in and you get large portions for the money.. 

The reason I gave the 5th star is because we had a server named John which was outstanding.. He literally would walk fast/run to the back.. When you can show customers that you will hustle that means a lot to me..  Go John D.
