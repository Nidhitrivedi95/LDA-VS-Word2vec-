SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA Despite the fact my order had to be remade 3 times as they couldn't get it right and my dad almost choked over a bone he had in one of his chicken tacos I can't give them five stars but I also can't give them less than 4 as they do have good food when prepared right. You can tell a lot about a mexican restaurant if they have good chips and salsa as usually the food is good I have found over the years. This restaurant is great and it might just be one of the top three mexican restaurants in Vegas. I love El Dorado but this is just right up there next to it.
