arpBUwgiaE8iqfNGMQ_hgg Terrible veg burrito! I couldn't even finish it I was so displeased.

The sweet potato burrito is very bland and not worth the time it took to wait for it or the money it cost to buy it. Service was indifferent and made me feel like I was a burden.

I think Burrito Boys is also terrible, but would still recommend it over Big Fat Burrito. If you're looking for a good veg burrito, Fresh has just added a good one to it's menu, or just walk around the corner and hit up the veg burrito gods at Hot Beans.
