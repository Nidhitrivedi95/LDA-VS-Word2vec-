EP1do6l8hLyIGEru0gN3EQ I tried Johnny Mango the other day with a friend who recommended it.  The decor was quirky and inviting, and I liked the idea of having different daily bread/spreads, grains, beans, etc.  However, the meal was not as good as we'd hoped.

I ordered the special margarita of the day, cucumber mint, which was...not too tasty.  My husband ordered the pomegranate fizz (non-alcoholic), and we were told that they were out of pomegranate, as well as mango, avocado, and guacamole.  On a Thursday?  Ok.  Well there goes my plan to order some guacamole as a starter and/or extra avocado with my meal.

I had the grilled chicken burrito, which unfortunately was bland (even with cheese that I ordered as an extra filling), as was the rest of my plate.  It wasn't even really a burrito to me, but more like a wrap.  It fell apart and didn't have that great, warm, "fill you up inside" quality that all good burritos have.

We had fried tofu as an appetizer, which tasted good only in the first 3 minutes before it got cold.  This, too, had absolutely no seasoning and thrived only on the dipping sauce it came with.

The nachos WERE excellent.

My husband and friend got quesadillas, which they were pretty happy with.  My husband's mojito, however?  Another story...he did not finish it.

I didn't want to take leftovers, but I didn't want to be rude, so I packed up half my meal.  Tried to eat it the next day, and just ended up tossing it.  

I had high hopes for JM...maybe I should have gone with my friend's initial suggestion and ordered the Pad Thai, which seems to be a crowd pleaser.
