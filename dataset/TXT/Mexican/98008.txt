ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA The restaurant has such a cool concept with different themes and tons of parking. We decided to make reservations for brunch since we didn't know if we would be welcomed with a wait. 

We sat inside and it was such a nice day! Our server at first, was awesome. Hubby ordered the Nutella iced coffee with boba. He came back to us with coffee that didn't have boba and since they ran out, the coffee was on the house. The coffee was pretty good! I bet it would be awesome with the boba! 

We then proceeded to order the iron skillet pancake with berries and the truffle quiche. The truffle quiche was good and it came with a small salad. The iron skillet pancake was enormous and it could probably feed at least 2-3 people! In my opinion, I wasn't a big fan of the pancake - it was just too thick and I didn't like the taste. 

Once the food was delivered to us, we didn't see our server at all. We ate our food, plates were being taken off of our table, a box was given to us for leftovers....and no server to give us the check! We start looking for him and watching his every move until finally, we made eye contact after 10 minutes of being done. 

Our bill came to a little over $22. I love the concept, but I think the service and food can improve a little bit.
