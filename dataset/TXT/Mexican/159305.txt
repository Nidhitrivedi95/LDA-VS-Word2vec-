Ktia9NJfvxVxTLVcEnw9zQ Every time I visit my home town of Phoenix this is the first place I go. Fast and delicious Mexican food, there is NOTHING like this where I live now.  The shredded beef tacos are awesome!  The beans and rice are always good. I have ordered many things off their menu and have never had anything that didn't make me smile!  I always get a fresh hot tortilla with butter and a dozen of their giant tortillas to take home.  This is one of my favorite places ever, don't ever change Carolina's!
