thLX_k20SPJ0KyusGTBIHw Honestly if I could give this restaurant zero stars I would. Horrible service, horrible drinks (ordered the prickly pear margarita) which had absolutely NO FLAVOR. Also, ordered the house burrito... a burrito with just refried would have had more flavor. Which was also served with a small handful of broken chips. Never going back there.
