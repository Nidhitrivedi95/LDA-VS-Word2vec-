aDAgex-HXefRvuTvxhq_Jg This was my first time dining at Rancho Los Alazanes.  My friend and I arrived during Happy Hour and were offered Happy Hour priced Margaritas, on the rocks or frozen for $4.99.  Crunchy warm chips and and homemade salsa were placed on the table.  I proceeded to order the chicken taco salad, which was prepared a little bit different than I expected (in a good way).   The salad was served in a warm tortilla shell bowl, and there was at least 2 inches of shredded, seasoned chicken in the bottom of the bowl, topped with lettuce, tomatoes, black beans and sour cream, I added a little bit the of homemade salsa served with our complimentary tortilla chips.   The meal, along with the Margarita, was pretty tasty.   I would definitely go back, if in the area.
