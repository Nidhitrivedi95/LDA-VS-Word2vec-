uBGPTzye3wrxZPf54AXuFg Very expensive for lunch on the weekends. You only get the dinner menu. Food was horrible. Guacamole not very good and the salsa was out of a jar. Got the steak, very, very raw.  Beans and rice were nothing special. Will not return that is for sure. Drinks very high priced and tasted very sugary and pre made.
