pomGBqfbxcqPv14c3XH-ZQ We had heard raving reviews about this place and were excited to check it out. Unfortunately it was nothing special, in fact it was a pretty poor dining experience.

Our wait wasn't that long, though the restaurant was incredibly busy. Our waitress had absolutely no people skills and was clearly in a rush to get through ordering and move on to a new table. She was also seemingly unable to answer any questions about the menu.

We ordered drinks and they were forgotten about until our entrees arrived, which was only minutes after the chips and salsa arrived. This kind of "speedy" service is nothing but rushing a guest through dinner so they can turn over the table faster. This resulted in little time to enjoy the chips, salsa, and guacamole we ordered.

The food was sub-par. The chips didn't taste fresh, the guacamole was covered in cheese (that wasn't specified on the menu) which completely took away from the taste of the avocados. I ordered the enchiladas (one red and one green) and both were tasteless. The sides of rice and beans tasted as if they had been sitting under a lamp for a good hour or so which wouldn't surprise me given how quickly they arrived. I also ordered a house margarita that tasted more like pure sugar than anything else.

Overall, poor service and mediocre food. Based on the rave reviews this establishment had up until the last few months, something has clearly gone wrong at Leticia's.
