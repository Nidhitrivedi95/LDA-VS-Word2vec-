ypo9QPXXTkpxzx8jGsxriA Drive to the next one. I wish I could opt for ZERO stars. Waited behind only two cars for 15 mins. Then when I got to the window the girl handed me my bag of two chalupas. This is what they looked like. When I asked for fresh chalupas (that hadn't been sitting for 15 mins) they asked me to pull around to get fresh ones. There was a guy employee who was really nice and said he would compensate with a card and cinnamon twists since I had to pull around. I waited five more minutes and when he came up to me and gave me my chalupas I asked him about the cinnamon twists and he said the manager told him that they wouldn't do anything else for me since they remade the chalupas... wth... waited 20 mins for two chalupas. You can see in the pictures that my chalupas sat for so long that they seeped through the wrapper. Nasty.
