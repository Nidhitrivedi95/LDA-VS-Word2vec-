95CCHowiE0W_ovv5-9lQAQ Me and my friends were all a little hungover and looking for some greasy food to help. Saw some good ratings for FatBoy so that's where we went as it was pretty close.

It's your typical in a strip mall place. Maybe 4 tables so take out is what they specialize in. They have a nice selection of burgers, pizza, and some mexican food. 

We ordered two guacamole boygers, and 2 cheesesteak sandwiches. I added a strawberry milkshake for $2.99 (good price). 

The boygers were ok. The meat is freshly pressed, but not seasoned much. Unfortunately, the cheesesteaks were not good. Small, little flavor, not much cheese. I would not order these again here. Very disappointing.

A very nice lady took our order, and the place is very clean. They weren't doing pizza yet at noon. Prices are very good and fair. You will probably find some items great here. Just not the cheesesteaks. 

I'd return, but order something different.
