SxelcKtJlN6X2Vlak0wXHw I absolutely love this place, I use to eat here at least once a week when I lived by the Metro Center Mall, but since I've moved out of town, I don't get the chance. I miss the food so much, and the people that work there were great too, were always very nice a prompt with my food...wish I could find another place like this were I live now...
