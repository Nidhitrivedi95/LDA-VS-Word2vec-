lVfZ2AaYRYHCFenUMQna8g At first, I wasn't sure about this place.They wear blue shirts with the Superman logo and they don't have a large selection of Mexican food.
However, after trying a carne asada super burrito, I'm hooked. The beans are whole, not refried or mashed. The meat is very good without much fat or grease. The flavor of the burrito was excellant and it does not leave you feeling like you just ate a 1lb of lard.

I highly recommend this place if you are in the mood for a great burrito, nachos, or carne asada fries.
