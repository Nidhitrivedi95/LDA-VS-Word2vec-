This is certainly not true Mexican food, it's very Americanized so as long as you go into it with that understanding, you won't be disappointed! There is usually a very long line around dinner time, especially on the weekends. I just wish they were open on Sundays, we've gone multiple time forgetting they are closed. But definitely a place to check out.
