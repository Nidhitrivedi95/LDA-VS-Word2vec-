My wife's shrimp dish was okay but lackluster and was also served nearly room temperature.  Our server was friendly and the manager greeted us but people were seated inches away from us though the restaurant was nearly empty. $16 sangria was essentially white wine with a few bits of fruit thrown in for looks.
