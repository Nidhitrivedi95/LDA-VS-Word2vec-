eYeFOcNJO2iTNPCPi8XAxw First time in Canada ( I might be the only Mexican in Canada) I come from Southern California and a I know what Authentic Mexican food is. Thought I'd check this place out to see what it was about. Did not disappoint! I tried a little of everything coming from a 6hour flight from LAX I was starving. The place is well maintained and the staff is very friendly. I got to meet the owner and his wife great people and the owner himself is Mexican (Michoacano)/ Canadian so he knows about Mexican food. I'm a taco guy so I'm def giving these guys a 5 star for the hospitality, ambiance, and the great food! Will def come back on my next venture here to beautiful Canada!
