aWYWNfHuQJyRwDHaHq8X1w Came to Tex Tubbs while visiting from out of town and was very impressed. They had a lot of vegetarian taco options which isn't very common at most taco places. I got the asparagus and fried cauliflower and much preferred the cauliflower - would definitely get again. Salsa bar was delicious - I love the option to choose my own rather than having to pick the salsa that works best for the table.
