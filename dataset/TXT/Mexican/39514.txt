6Gm8wh3N-su9wMaYzGreAg Finally, a Roberto's Taco Shop near the crib. I can finally get my Carne Asada Nachos fix anytime I want. No more, "Man, it's too far to drive" or "But Jack in the Box got the dopest Raspberry Iced Tea" or "I'm in the middle of watching this dope scene on BangBros" excuses anymore. Well maybe if I am watching a dope scene with Amy Reid. That chick is slammin. But you know what I don't like about the scenes nowadays? When they look in the camera when they not supposed to. Kinda of turn off. You know us asians, we love them white girls. But you know what else asians love? A Carne Asada Burrito with no guacamole and extra cheese.
