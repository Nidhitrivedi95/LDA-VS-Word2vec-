G3pcVtRukZM2oKiLeNiUUA Great service, great price, and great food. I've been eating here for almost a year now and thought I should probably leave a review. I've always had a good experience here with fast service. My favorites would probably be their $3.95 breakfast burritos and their carne asada fries. Delicious! All their meals are made fresh and they also offer catering for big parties. 

Always good for a late night meal too!
