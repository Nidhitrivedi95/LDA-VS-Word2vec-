50NTSGbZ3pN5643_K1IReA So a normal Friday night with family and friends turns into worst nightmare imaginable.  First of all Mexican Pizza was cold, meat was dry, and olives taste like rubber.  Service was substandard with waitress bringing extra drinks without request.  Owner at 11:00 is drunk or something, starts a fight with a patron across the bar from me.  I witnessed the scrum started by the owner and other employees.  The owner is lucky he is not being sued by the man he struck. I immediately left with my wife in case things got worse.  Definitely not a place I would recommend!  Please stay away from there at all cost, something isn't right...
