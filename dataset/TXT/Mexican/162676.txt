lap6PTY8pyckPSMgvCuIbA Yum yum yum!! Great little place to come either with friends or the family. I even been  here with my daughter and with friends for a night out. Food was great and the Prickly Pear Margarita was GREAT!! My daughter and I loved the nachos! We sorta strayed from the menu a little, but it was no sweat for them! They said 'no problem' and they came out perfect! My daughter L-O-V-E-S the green salsa, pretty tasty!! All around great place to go!!
