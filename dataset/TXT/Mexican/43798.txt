7KkgMcbVaetryW1wwpzvvA Fresh food! I don't need to say anymore! But I will...

$10 for a salad that fills you up for 24 hours!
$2.50 - $3 for a side of chicken/steak that is entree portioned. 
You can see them making everything they serve right in front of your eyes. 

I love this location because they are generous with the meat and the customer service is ON POINT! They try to get you through their super long lines as quickly as the customers will allow. 

I go here at LEAST once a week, as it is right by my work.
