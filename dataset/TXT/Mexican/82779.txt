d0aLkD3VQ3sijckod-oSDg I normally don't write reviews.   But since my horrible experience with ECCO shoes, I've decided to write reviews when I've had a positive experience.  Ate lunch (no Pirate game).  I had the chicken tacos Steel Cactus way with mango habanero sauce.  Spicy but mouth burning.  Really liked the black bean side dish.  Tea was very good which is important to me.  Service was very good.  Great day to sit outside in the shade and people watch.
