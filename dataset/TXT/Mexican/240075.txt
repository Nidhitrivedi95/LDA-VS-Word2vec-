T2tEMLpTeSMxLKpxwFdS3g Went here for a birthday dinner after getting tattoo's at Fu's across the street. Ate here once before and really liked the food so we decided to go again.  The food was really tasty, Blackened Mahi Taco's with Avocado pasta and Battered Shrimp Taco's with rice. We all had NODA Jam Session draft beer and that was really good as well. We arrived 20 minutes before closing and we're told as we walked in to order quickly and we felt rushed by the staff and especially the waiter. When he brought our beer he told us if we wanted another it was last call, so we asked for one and he told us we had to drink the first before he could bring another - apparently state law.  OK, so why tell us it was last call.  No attention. No care in our food or service.  We'll go back but not within 30 minutes of closing.  We felt rushed and ignored!
