-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg I enjoy the going to Oldtown Gilbert and this was one of the restraunts Ive always wanted to try. The service was excellent. Our food came fast and was hot. We ordered the standard chicken tacos. Other wise it wasnt too spicy. Since it was happy hour they were only $2.00 each. They were tiny, but surprisingly filling. The atmosphere was similar to the breakfast place next door. It was loud and almost had to yell across the table just to have a conversation. Desert menu only offered three items. We didnt see any desert we liked so went to another restaurant nearby for desert. Other than that I would recommend this place if you are looking for something quick and tasty.
