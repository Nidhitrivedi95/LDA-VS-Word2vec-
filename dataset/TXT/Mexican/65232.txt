b8ublvizuqIw3Ib8pK4fDw My co-workers and I were there last evening for Happy Hour, and we can be a large group who enjoy spending a few hours after work together from time to time.  That said, we often find the bar area to be difficult for conversation, so we asked for tables to be pushed together along the back wall, and we asked for separate checks.  What we loved:  hand mixed margaritas (we love the bartenders here) and Negra Modela on draft (why every Mexican restaurant doesn't do this is beyond me).  What we had issues with:  Service, service, service.  We were told separate checks were OK until we got one check and had to split drinks and apps and food orders out ourselves and figure out bill on the back of the check.  Of course, the server could add his 20% on as we were then a large group.  Ah, but his service was not worth 20 %.  I ordered a draft, my friend ordered one bottled beer, and we got two bottled beers (which were a little off in flavor), and he waved me off when I tried to get his attention to remind him that I never got my draft.  Yes there were dinner customers by this time, but there were still a lot of empty tables.  Sorry, Verde, I don't care if you serve gold in your food--teach your servers to handle large groups.  I felt gouged, and I was not alone.  Would we have had this problem at the bar?  Absolutely not.  Will I suggest this for an office function again?  Absolutely not.  Will I meet one or two at the bar for the excellent cocktails?  Of course.
