JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg Good or OK Mexican food !
I like the place but still does not compare with Mexican restaurants in L.A. 
We requested the Chapulines, good flavor but a little bit salty in my opinion and do not come with tortillas which is wired. My main dish was Mole Enchiladas, good portion and good mole.
I gave 4 stars because is only good food not Great food and it is expensive compare with other Mexican restaurants. ( They charge an extra 3.50 if you request more chips and salsa ) 
Service is good but not excellent either!
