WGFJbxzhO44Ku05BM1hDjA EDIT (3/30/13): It seems that Tito's has gone pretty downhill, as many of the Mexican restaurants in the Akron area do.

I went there last night, and had a not so great experience.  The food was meh, when it once had been extraordinary.  It just isn't nearly as flavorful as it once was.

The number of people in the restaurant reflects this.  Before, I would have to wait about a half hour to get a table.  Now, I can walk right in.  On a Saturday night.  Plus, when you wake up at three in the morning with a bad stomachache from this food, you know it probably isn't too great.  

Maybe it was just the dish I got, but it was once much better than the recent times I have gone to Tito's.

Sorry Tito's, but there are other Mexican restaurants in the area much better and more consistent than you.
