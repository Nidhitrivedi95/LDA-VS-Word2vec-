nveeiYhDhj0WJu1JUmx9fw We have been visiting Rio Rico for quite some time.  ALWAYS, the food is great - both taste and portions - as well as the staff (mostly family, I believe) being very prompt and attentive.  No matter how busy, Mario always seems to find time to stop by the table and greet each patron.

My normal meal is either the Crab Enchilada or Camarones al Chipotle - though I have strayed to others!  I think I started the "Fishbowl Margarita", which I always order!

Definitely, if you would like a really good meal, visit Rio Rico - Val Vista and Guadelupe in Gilbert!!
