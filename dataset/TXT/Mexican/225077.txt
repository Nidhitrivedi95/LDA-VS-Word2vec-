RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg I must rate this place one star because of the service, the tacos are good, but I recommend the Mula over the tacos.

The reason for the low score is the service. There are 5 lines, ONE LINE FOR EACH MEAT option, that upset me big time. We were in a line expecting to be able to order any meat, but were sorely mistaken. After waiting 20 minutes to get to the front of the line, we asked for 4 asada tacos. The attendant said "sorry. The line for asada is 2 lines down". We were like WTF!!! He then said "you are in the adobada line". ***how does that make any sense????***  therefore you need to get in one line for asada and then let those tacos get cold as you get into another line for adobada and then let those tacos get cold as you get into another line for tripas. WTF!!!  How does this make any sense?  Oh and did I mention it took us 20 minutes to get to the front of the adobada line (which was the shortest of all 5). 

If you want to go to this place you need to take the amount of people with you with the amount of different meats that you want. Example: you want two meats take 2 people. One person stands in asada line and the other in adobada line and you order each other's tacos. Do not take kids because it is packed and it is a true cluster. You can't expect kids to be patient as you try to stand in each line to order a different meat.

Like I said. Food is good, but honestly not soooo good that it is worth dealing with the crouds and multiple lines and confusion.

That is just my opinion but I always recommend you find out your own experiences. Good luck.

Will my husband and I go back "HECK NO!!!"
