ZBFfY_WLbp19sADTZ_LRMg This has to be the greatest Mexican food experience I've ever had in Toronto! 
The tacos will take your taste buds straight to the streets of Mexico City.
The atmosphere is welcoming and simple.
The mojitos are perfectly refreshing, as is the lemonade. 
An absolute bonus is the fact that you are able to buy their house-made salsas to take home to enjoy.
Overall a wonderful food experience!
