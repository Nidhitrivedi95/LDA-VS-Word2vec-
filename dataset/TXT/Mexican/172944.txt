mES9E5K4HbYoPFXGv0pUuw The food was great! Delicious authentic Mexican food (except the hot salsa isn't appropriately hot enough for an authentic Mexican restaurant).

We got the beef burrito and creamy chipotle chicken enchiladas. The enchiladas came with some salsa on the side as well as rice and beans. There were also picketed jalapeños, carrots, and onions at a self served bar which goes great with the food. 

You can watch them assemble the food because there is a glass window. Service is super fast and friendly and we liked the food.
