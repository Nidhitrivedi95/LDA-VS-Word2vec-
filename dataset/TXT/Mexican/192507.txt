OlA7h9oOttqTALudvEUzTg We just saw Gloria's had opened and decided to try it for lunch.  We ordered a margarita each and received some free chips and salsa.  The margaritas were on the sweet side; not my favorite.  The chips were fine as was the salsa.  Warm chips would have been better.
Our food was reasonably priced and tasty.  The atmosphere could use improvement as off-duty employees were hanging out yakking with working employees and it just did not seem like a business.  More like visiting strangers in their home.

We will give it another try as the food was good.
