7tdVsSDXRKtLLC-fD1hJ-A The portions here are gigantic! So be prepared for leftovers.  I really like the interior of this restaurant too. It is dark but in a really good relaxing way.  The best things to get in my opinion is the chile renello or the barrio tacos.  I also love the pollo rico.  Another standout aspect of this place has always been their service.  It is always very welcoming and efficient.
