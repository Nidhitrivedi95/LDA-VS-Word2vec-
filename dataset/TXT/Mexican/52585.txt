9Jc3W0aR9Xf2gcHI0rEXsw It's 3 AM Monday morning, and I'm still suffering from the food poisoning I got from Garden Grill Saturday night. Not only that, the food wasn't even halfway decent. I had the beef ribs- they were uninspiring at best. Hardly any sauce on them, but even a tub of sauce wouldn't have changed the fact that the ribs themselves were bad. My digestive system despises you, Garden Grill.
