UJb1PrUWDFfuzwUPc1pP4Q This place sucks. I wasn't let in because I had a temporary drivers license that I had got 2 days ago in Texas. I also had a had copy of my Texas security license, and my old i.d card from texas. All issued by the dmv, all with the same picture and DOB. Apparently the state of Arizona doesnt accept real licenses....it wouldnt be so bad, but the "security" were assholes.
