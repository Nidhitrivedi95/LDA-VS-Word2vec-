sAu9UJ5tvY6sc9Q_gcVV7Q We went here for a family dinner and left very disappointed. The place seemed very dingy, unkept - when we finally got our food, I didn't even eat mine. It was not the most pleasant burro I've had, to put it kindly. - for the price you could get much better quality food elsewhere. Would not reccomend going here, unfortunately!!
