70WDApYtMcLlrnb1EUW6fg Went there for dinner with family and friends. Two of us ordered Steak fajitas and another person ordered a Beef dish.  All of our meats were so tough that we kept on chewing as if it was cardboard.  Has to be the worst steak I've ever had!  Tougher and so chewy that our jaws were hurting and at the end we would just give up by spitting it out.  We let the waitress know and she said that she would inform the kitchen.  Even though our dishes were not even half way eaten, we were charged for our dishes and not offered an alternative.  Been their many times and it's getting worse and worse each time.  We have celebrated many holiday dinners there but this will be my last visit there!
