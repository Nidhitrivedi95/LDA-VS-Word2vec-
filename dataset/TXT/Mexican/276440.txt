XGPBQJNTq5qxFZPQR32f3g Went here today for the first time and were  disappointed, the girl at the order counter seemed confused by our order of two flour tortillas one with refried beans and one with avocado. Then missed my Diet Coke.
The avocado added $1.50 to the tortilla and it was apparently spread on with a brush it was barely visible on the tortilla.
Not the old Guedo's I remember so we won't be back.
