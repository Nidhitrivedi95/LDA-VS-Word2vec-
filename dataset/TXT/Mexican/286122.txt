YaTlfyPieOXwHH16wzieFg I love Cafe Rio and their food is amazing but today when I went in to get food before my work shift the workers were moving sooooo slow, the line was decently long maybe like 7-8 people in front of me. But it shouldn't have taken me 25-30 minutes just to get through the line & pay.
It was by far my worst experience in a cafe rio. On top of the slow service they also got my boyfriends order wrong... which is hard to do since they literally make the food right in front of you as you order it.
