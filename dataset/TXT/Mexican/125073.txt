hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg My family was visiting from out of town for Mother's Day Weekend and we wanted to try a new restaruant that none of us had gone to before. The hostess seated the four us on the patio and presented us with 3 filthy menus.  They were covered in food and salsa.  When we requested clean menus the hostess retrieved the 3 dirty menus and brought us back 3 MORE DIRTY MENUS!!!  When our server Javier came to the table we told him about the menu situation and he seem less than bothered and never took care of the problem.  Luckily one of us had hand sanitizer with us and we proceeded to clean our own menus so we could order! While we were ordering the server seemed more interested in watching the people walk by the patio than on giving us his attention.  Food was pretty good.  Water glasses were never refilled.  Server did not check on us regularly.  One of the members in our party went into the restaurant to speak with a manager about the sub standard service. The server Javier saw us speaking with the manager and without finding out what our complaint was; WENT TO OUR TABLE AND CONFRONTED MY PARENTS WHO ARE VISITING FROM OUT OF TOWN AND SAID, 'WELL I HEAR YOU WEREN'T HAPPY?"  The manager was very apologetic and comped our meal but we could not believe that the server confronted the table!  I have worked in Food and Beverage myself for years but have never experienced or observed such rudeness from a server.   Although the manager tried to recover us I will never return to the Cantina Loredo and I would suggest that anyone reading this to go spend their hard earned money elsewhere!
