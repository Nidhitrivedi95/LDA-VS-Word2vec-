bbovSsUMkTXQSIVNBa9moQ I met a friend here for lunch today. I have been to other Mad Mex's and this is definitely the nicest one. It sits riverside so there is a wonderful view. There is a nice patio that has a big shuffleboard game, Connect 4 game, as well as a very nice fire pit to hang out at. I will go back in the Spring and hang out since it will be warmer. 
When you walk in there is a small room before you actually step into the restaurant. The walls are covered in small paintings that look like they were painted by children. Inside the restaurant, while still within the theme of the chain, seems a bit elevated in the interior design. 
We ordered Mahi Mahi Tacos and a chicken burrito. We asked for a side of guacamole. It didn't take long for our food to come. It was all fresh and hot. As we were eating we both noticed something was a bit spicy. If you read my reviews you know I can't do spice. It seems that the guacamole was spicy. I was disappointed because it never has been before and it means I can't eat it. 
The rest of the food was very tasty. 
Our service was very good. Even as the restaurant filled the server kept checking on us. All in all it was a very good experience.
