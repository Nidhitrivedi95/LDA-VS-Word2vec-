zJGtD3y-pAIGNId4codEEg Disappointed. I walked in and attempted to put my name on the list, but was told to please wait. There were several people waiting and plenty of empty tables. After 10 minutes I asked if I could finally leave my name for a table. The guys says sure "there's a 45 minute wait". I explained that I had already been waiting and questioned why there was even a wait when half the restaurant is empty. He stated that all the empty tables "are for reservations". Well shit, I've never had to make reservations at 6pm on a Tuesday night and I've never had to wait 10 minutes just to be put on a wait list. I remember the food being good, which is why I went back, but the service really lacked.
