mz1zD5_eqyCQNuzAqB_iKg This is the best vegan Mexican food I've ever had in my life!! Seriously it does not disappoint. The restaurant is not located on the strip in Vegas but for a short drive you can have the most authentic tasting vegan Mexican dishes ever! My husband and I started with their vegan horchata, the guacamole and chips, and the loaded nachos as an appetizer. I ordered crunchy potato tacos, and my husband ordered the vegan burrito with potatoes inside. We ended up sharing our dishes and everything was just perfectly seasoned and so delightful. "So good you would never know it's vegan!" 
They have an entire separate menu for vegan/vegetarian options but they also serve all the regular meat based dishes as well. 
Our server was so friendly and helpful, my husband and I couldn't believe how lucky we were to have found this place and their deliciousness! 
This will always be our go to food when we come to Vegas!
