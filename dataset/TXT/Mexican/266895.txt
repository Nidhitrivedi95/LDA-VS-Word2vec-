Wht6JaY_yLIb3usuPvSulA If I could give a zero I would. Should have read the reviews before going. Where to begin? Oh yes they have a sign that they want you to wait to be seated but then expect you to sit as no one welcomes you. The place was empty so you would think food would be served at a decent wait. Well first of all the waitress claims that our party of 10 was to big so she needed a minimum of 4 separate bills. We said ok then she took 20 minutes to bring our drinks. When the place was empty. I ordered a jarrito with tequila well it was a sunny d beverage no tequila there for $13 instead of the $10 on the menu with a quality of a dollar. Next our food after a long long wait was cold and tasteless. No lemons no salt on the table no refill of sodas no napkins but remember about the separate bills? Well each was charged a $10 tip on each one. So that's why the bills were separated. Mind you none of the totals were less than $90 when I orders fish tacos at $5 and shrimp cocktail plus my sunny d beverage and a michelada totaled to $85. My sister who ordered 3 items under $20 paid $70 . How is this place in business ???
