FI-8LPGkc8D_hwx0l0zyyg Found this place clear back in like 2010. I had the BEST fish tacos EVER! This place was never far from my mind when I had fish tacos other places. I finally went back to Scottsdale 6 years later and BEGGED my boyfriend to bring me here. Once he tried it he knew what I was talking about! Now this is out go to place any time we are in town. Everything we tried on the menu was awesome...and the sangria.. service is good and servers are friendly. My boyfriend is super picky and they made his food to order without getting annoyed with him..huge plus! Don't miss out on this place!
