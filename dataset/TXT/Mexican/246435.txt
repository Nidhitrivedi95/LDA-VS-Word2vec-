Tv1CcqD67_Bz9YJadLgMuw When reviewing this place one has to consider its competitors out there. All the burritos places are relatively the same price wise so its really not that expensive, and guac is usually  extra. In the few burrito bars where it isn't.. Well the guac is not that great. 

Now with all this in mind, I must say I like this place a lot. I have eaten in just about every burrito bar out there. It has good flavor and taste for a chain restaurant. I come here when I am in the area and looking for some Mexican food. Now of course you can get a better burrito at some good Mexican restaurants. But thats like comparing a Macdonald's burger to a restaurant burger. So compared to stores similar it is pretty darn good.
