6LVadHqqjWlVnd-T7gAZyA We've had an awesome experience here!! Seated fast, they immediately brought chips with salsa and beans, took our order fast and brought us our drinks!! All within 5 minutes of sitting down. I loved the chips and beans so much I was too full for my meal. But! I had an enchilada and it was delicious!! Husband had a taco and a steak quesadilla, but wasn't impressed. I think the atmosphere is so beautiful here. Definitely family friendly. Has pleasant Mexican music playing in the back ground. Definitely an authentic Mexican feel to it! Will be coming back :)
