arpBUwgiaE8iqfNGMQ_hgg I really wanted to like Big Fat Burrito. And I liked it. I just didn't love it, and I probably wouldn't go back. (Though I do love that they have a "petite" size for smaller appetites. 

I got a small veggie, with everything but green peppers and it was alright, but it just wasn't great. I know you're supposed to like the little guys more than the chains, but I'd have rather had Chipotle, honestly. There was supposed to be sour cream, cheese, and guacamole and while I saw a tiny (I really mean tiny) bit of cheese and guacamole, I saw and tasted no sour cream, which reading other reviews seems pretty common. My burrito traveled about 20 min home, so I expected it wouldn't be HOT, but maybe luke warm, but it was flat out cold when I got home. So that was a little weird. 

On the upside, it's a cool location, the servers were super friendly, and the service was fast.
