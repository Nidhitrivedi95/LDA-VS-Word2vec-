EP1do6l8hLyIGEru0gN3EQ Had the pleasure of going to Johnny Mango's on 12/13/15 I heard how great of a spot this is especially for Taco Tuesday's from my brother but I decided to go on a Sunday.....laid by atmosphere....not a really huge place but they do have a patio....anyway I wanted to try the Laska soup ....I did....it was awesome....... I also tried the PEPPERMINT MARGARITA  can you say in love....my server Matt was awesome & very interacting something I like when sitting to choose to sit at the bar....Although we ran into a problem as we were there well over an hour before the other party got their food, mine came out quickly I need to add, so I giving them a 4 for that reason....it seems that they took care of the to go orders first and kinda forgot about the customers actually sitting there waiting on their food..... although Matt did rectify the situation and was very apologetic.....I felt it was not a good look for a first timer but because something was done I will definitely be back and hopefully this won't be an issue again......I suggest you giving them a try, it's a really cool spot to kick it at....you'll have fun.
