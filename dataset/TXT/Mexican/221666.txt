rOHLBGBcWzlxdvNI6squgQ I've tried one of the downtown locations before and really enjoyed it. My experience at the Banksville location wasn't quite as enjoyable, unfortunately. I felt Bea Taco Town at Banksville has lower food quality and the space was kind of gross. I'm not a hater of no frills dining but when there is a fly trap at each table, that just turns me off. There's nothing like eating your food next to a cup of floating dead flies. 

Anyhow, we started with the chips and queso. The chips seemed slightly stale and the queso was alright. Our quesadilla and chimichanga both initially tasted ok but quickly got to be a bit too salty for my taste. Additionally, the way my chimichanga came out did not look anything like the way it looked in the photo on the menu. Was kind of bummed about that. Oh well. 

I probably won't be stopping in here anytime soon. Let's hope the kitchen isn't also filled with fly traps!
