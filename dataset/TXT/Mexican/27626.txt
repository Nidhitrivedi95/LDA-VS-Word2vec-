3IwCop28R1_L5jMv6AkL8Q When this was Super Mex we loved it.   The food is still pretty good,  but watch out.   We were a table of 5 and when we got the check it seemed high.  Upon review, the server had changed the party # to 8, thereby guaranteeing her the 18% tip.   We had not noticed and put another 20% on there.   She would have received a $45 tip if we did not bring it to the managers attention.  The people next to us said she does it all the time.   They may be more patient than I am, I won't be going back.
