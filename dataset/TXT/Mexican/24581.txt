2XkVexeY_8zyc9nriSElQg Me and my boyfriend decided to try this place out and I was immediately disappointed by the service of the cashiers, but the cooks were very nice. We ordered a tripas burrito with everything and a large order of carne asada fries... I was excited to go home and eat it and the second I unwrapped it I could tell something was wrong. The tortilla was extremely gritty and when I took a bite it was of just of the strangest cheesy and crunchy texture that tasted like a week old velveeta that was left out and just thrown into the burrito. I usually am very picky about the tripas meat too, and found myself almost puking from disgust from the stale and over-salted meat; there was no beans or rice... Nothing I've ever had in a burrito but this cheesy mess and over cooked meat. 
My boyfriend opened his meal and found a weird minty green sauce over the fries. I took a bite out of his fries (which was definitely an improvement from my burrito) and it was alright, but still wasn't good. I'd recommend not going unless you're probably getting tacos... Which I'm not going back to have.
