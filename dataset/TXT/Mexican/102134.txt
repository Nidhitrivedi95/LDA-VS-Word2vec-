f-Nk4rNCmJhYom1_6RdWqg Simply poor service. Went there for a drink, the place was pretty busy, so I sat at the bar. Ordered a beer and a buddy ordered some chips. We waited probably 10 minutes for the beers, chips never showed. I tried to pay one of the bartenders for the beer but he said he couldn't run the register. We had to wait another 10 minutes or so for the other bartender to pay for the drinks and left. Bad form, guys.
