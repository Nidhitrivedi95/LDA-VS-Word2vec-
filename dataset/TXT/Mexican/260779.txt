VRwT0pscR5vESCrAnUpNwQ Great concept - decent food, but they really should consider a "daily special" to change up the menu a little.

I go often because it's close by. Shrimp and Shroom Quesadilla is my go to... a little greasy sometimes, but that's ok with me most of the time. 

I would revisit the guac' recipe. Not really memorable for the right reasons....
