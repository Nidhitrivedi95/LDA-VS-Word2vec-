gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw I'm a bit torn writing this review. We just had lunch at Chica and the food is very good; guacamole was chunky and flavorful with a variety of interesting chips, Cuban sandwich was delicious, corn lollipops yummy, tacos delicious. But wow, very fully priced. Two tiny 3 bite shrimp tacos, a little side of black beans and marinated veggies were $18! My son's mini bottle of Diet Coke was $6. Iced tea $6. Cuban sandwich $18 (which seemed like the best value in our order) It's too much for a casual lunch and I don't think we'll return.
