T1lOHMIas_PSflKY7duF_g Very slow service, compared to other Chipotle's, yet friendly. My issue with this location is the food quality, too many times have I came here and had an issue with my food. Whether it be rock hard and uncooked rice, or well done chicken, there's a 50/50 chance something will be wrong with the food quality at this location. For whatever reason I keep taking that chance whenever Chipotle does the bogo deals. Anyways, very friendly staff but slow and poor food quality compared to other locations.
