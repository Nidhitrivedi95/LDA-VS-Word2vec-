MM572Htt9k_e96IKNyCEtA I don't dine by myself often but i did yesterday for lunch. I chose to sit outside in a covered area and had the space all to myself pretty much. I wanted something light so I decided to go with the achiote tofu bowl and a glass of rosé. The bowl had a good amount of salsa and flavor and it was really good. The waitress asked if I wanted dessert and she suggested a slice of pie after telling her I didn't want anything too sweet. It was a light pumpkin spice mousse pie and very tasty. Service was attentive and I enjoyed the food. Spent about $42; a little pricey for 1 person but oh well. No complaints.
