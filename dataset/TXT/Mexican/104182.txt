fbQaKW0Lte0JQ_opbnjdKg The food is very good. My favorite thing in the salad. It is always super fresh and the options are great for what you want in your salad whether you want all vegetables or not. I have also had the pork and the chicken tacos and I would totally recommend them as well. 

The only drawback is the setting. There isn't a lot available and it is kind of cramped. Also, the chairs look great but are really uncomfortable. If you happen to have a backpack or purse you are going to have to eat with it in you lap because the chairs have a design that won't let you sling your things over the back without them falling on the floor. 

Buuuuuuut, the food is very good so I still definitely enjoy coming here I just wish they would get better chairs.
