R68SX1-FFLvv6BqsK9-Alw GOOD FOOD and good VALUE! ....However...I will NEVER understand how OWNERS, GM's, Floor Managers do not prepare their servers and require their servers to perform the BASICS of GREAT service!!  Simple Steps of Service!!   How are you folks doing today?.....Great my name is BLANK.....HAVE YOU FOLKS been here before???  Yes?  Welcome BACK!  NO?  Welcome for the first time!!  EXPLAIN WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU WANT TO BE KNOWN FOR!!!!!!  YOUR FAVORITES....ANY SPECIALS....SUGGEST ITEMS!!!   Take an order....anticipate needs...drink refills etc. CHECK BACK....is everything cooked properly????  Is everyone SATISFIED and happy....Wonderful.  THANK YOUR GUEST FOR THEIR BUSINESS....there are a ZILLION other places to eat especially in AZ!!  Let them know of other days specials...   GOOD GOD how does this not happen???   You know what this is???  Its called CUSTOMER SERVICE....and it separates the winners from the losers!  Good Luck!!
