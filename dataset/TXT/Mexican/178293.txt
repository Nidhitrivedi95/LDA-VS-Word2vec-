MvVCSyFIpmKKV8URk0HWIQ This Taco Bell is right near my house so I happen to go there every once in a while, and each time I am disappointed. This last time, I asked for a burrito, and even after confirming the order and correcting them I was given the burrito BOWL. I noticed this when I got home and I was a little upset but it wasn't a huge deal, but when I opened the bowl, there was hardly anything in there! I didn't use to have any issues here but as of recently I am disappointed eventually time I come in. I love Taco Bell, but probably will go to one a little further away next time.
