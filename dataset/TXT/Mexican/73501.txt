Cfry9-vvuseDsbF3Q2H8ew I was so excited to find out there was a Rivas on my side of town. The first few times I went the food and service was GREAT. The last two times was horrible and due to this very last time I will never in my life go to this location. I ordered 3 burritos and they were all incorrect, I paid 85 cents for each additional condiment. I added beans, sour cream and pico. None of them had what I paid for. I called and the lady sarcastically said I can refund your 85 cents. I was extremely upset due to the fact she didn't even offer to make it right. I asked for my money back, she spoke to the manager and he agreed to refund my money. Once I get to Rivas the cook, the cashier lady, and the manager were at the counter. Not to mention the cashier lady was on a personal call on her cell phone which was so unprofessional. The cook opened the burritos and told the manager he added sour cream but it melts and becomes transparent. Wow really? Who in their right mind would believe that lie. So the manager told the cashier lady to refund my money. Mind you she was still on her personal phone on a call in front of the register not acknowledging me whatsoever. She finally after five minutes gets off her phone and only tries to refund me the amount for the burritos and not the extra condiments I paid for which was in total over $7. I was upset and I said to her excuse me miss you owe me money. She got mad and gave me attitude. When she gave me the correct amount she than threw it on the counter. I understand she's upset but that's a business employees are the front line of the business and what make clients come back. Worse experience ever! If I could give negative stars I would!
