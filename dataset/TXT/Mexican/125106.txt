hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg Good food, horrible service. Ordered the enchiladas with crab meat. It came with zucchini and rice as the sides and they were fantastic! The service was so bad that  a women that wasn't our waitress started waiting on us. After waiting forever, we finally flagged down our server for the check. He apologized and said he was busy with other tables on the other side of the restaurant. Not a good excuse.
