gOBxVkHpqtjRRxHBIrpnMA What more can you say about Chipotle.  Now I've been to a number of Chipotles in the US and the one on Yonge is really no different than any of the other.  Chipotle has a formula for what they look like and what they serve.  

The only difference with this location versus many of the others that I've been to... No massive line up to order !  

I ordered my usual, Bowl, white rice, black beans, half chicken half sofritas, mild, cheese, lettuce and cilantro.  As expected it tasted exactly like it had all the other times I've ordered it in different locations.  

Overall, it's good food, predictable service and a standard look and feel.  It works for me as almost like comfort food.
