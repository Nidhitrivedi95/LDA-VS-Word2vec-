jScBTQtdAt-8RshaiBEHgw So we live in the neighborhood and finally decided to try this place.  We came at about 10:30 on a Thursday, so the place was not very busy.  The decor is simple and rather cheap.  The prices on the menu seemed rather high for a breakfast/lunch place.  Our expectations, at that point, were not very high.

What a surprise!!!!  The food was the best we had in the neighborhood and we have other places that are fairly good.  What's more, the portion sizes were large.  I had the pork belly bahn mi and it was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  It had a good amount of pork belly and quick pickled vegetables that were still crunchy the way I like them.  My wife had the bread pudding and she couldn't stop raving about it.  The balance of flavors was clearly superior.  It was large enough for 2 or 3 meals.

Now you have to understand that I rarely rate food places high because I am an amateur chef.  My wife has not liked ANY restaurant since we moved here last year and she is very difficult to please.  She loved it.

The chef came out and we spoke to him.  There are several items on the menu I'd like to try.  I prefer out-of-the box creations especially with an ethnic touch and there is a lot for me to try.  They have a large burger menu and their burgers are made with ground short rib meat.  That's one I have to try.

They do have a limited staff so I would imagine service will be slow if there are a lot of customers.  Everything is made on the spot so it is extremely fresh.  That will take some time so don't come here if you are in a rush or have small children who aren't patient.  Also, if ambiance is your thing, try elsewhere.  But if you come to a restaurant for the food, this is one of the best places you can try.
