QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA Wasn't any better than other nachos I've had, and it also cost more. They ripped us off on the pitchers. Pitchers were 35 and the single serve size was 10. The pitcher poured like 2 drinks maybe... so if you want average nachos and ripoff drinks, then I guess it's fine. There's simply better places to go, but most of Las Vegas is designed to rip you off. I mean, it's the gambling capitol of the world, so I guess by Vegas standards this place deserves the 4 stars or so it has, but otherwise it's a 2. Would be 3 if the prices were more reasonable. Then a 4 if the food was actually better than average.
