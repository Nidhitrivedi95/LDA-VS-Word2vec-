ydqbNz2sHENV9XOElwyAYA Wow. . .sooooo awful what a shock. . .we had a very broad range of food from 4 bean con queso, guac, special cheese/tortilla concoction to chimiganga, enchiladas, tacos, pork tamale, shrimp relleno. The smoky salsa was really good and these other items were just the opposite.   . .either bland or just "slop". This is so hard to absorb given the reviews, the busy restaurant with a wait when we left. Just. Plainly. Awful. If you like this kind of stuff then you have no business reviewing on Yelp. The end. :(
