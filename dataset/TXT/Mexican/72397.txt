cChJhpiljARaINk-dyXGiQ Just discovered this place today and decided to check it out. Definitely do not judge a book by it's over. Walking in, it was a great atmosphere. This place is BYOB, no need to elaborate any further. Our waiter was very attentive and for how busy it was, we were filled up with our chips/drinks as soon as they were running low. The food was fantastic. I was beyond satisfied with the taste and the portion for the price. We will definitely become regulars at this place.
