XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Yes,yes, and yes!!!! Mesa is AMAZING!!! We had a phenomenal waiter. He was obviously educated on the food and made our experience wonderful. I can't remember his name now but I made sure to speak with the Manager before we left to compliment him. The food is pricey but worth every single penny. 
We enjoyed the shrimp appetizer. It was everything!! I had the chicken dinner and my husband had a steak that he says is the best steak he's ever eaten...ever. We also had the corn side dish and the risotto and both were absolutely delicious.We topped it off with the chocolate cake that I cannot even describe in words. Just gooey chocolate
Goodness. I had one (ok 3) of the margaritas that the waiter suggested. So good...so,so good! We will absolutely return on our next trip to Vegas!
