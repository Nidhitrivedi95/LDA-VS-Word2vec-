You also have to try their jalapeño ranch to dip with your chips (it is free), and it is not very spicy- I don't like a lot of spice.  I would definitely recommend their chicken quesadilla appetizer, because their tortillas are fresh and hand made to order.  There quesadillas are also packed with creamy cheese, juicy chicken and are always served sizzling hot!  This is one of my family's favorite places to eat, because they are quick, fresh, fairly priced and they have an extensive menu.  The restaurant's decor is fun and they have various spaces to accommodate large gatherings, such as birthday parties.  It is definitely family friendly and it is fun for the kids to watch the workers make the fresh tortillas.  It is also a great place to go if you are looking for something pretty casual, but want table service. 
*There is usually not much of a wait, since the restaurant is so large... Also they do a great job refilling your FREE chips and salsa!
