75vRgse6O3P4GL_vi3Xr9Q Well it took some time. My gf now hates this place. I would come with her because she didn't want to eat alone. I'm not a fan of these tacos.  They are a dollar for a reason.  They are small, meat sucks, no cilantro or onions which I rather have over cabbage or whatever it is. Last time we went my gf didn't finish her tacos. The "carne asada" look more like ground beef. The meat was really shredded. The meat lacks flavor, always has. I don't get how people rate this 5 stars but there are better taco places. This one is mediocre at best. 

I wish they can get rid of the bums. Yes I get it they are homeless but trust me I have bought them tacos since they ask for food and not $. 3 of them approach me the other night. I told the lady if they can please tell them to go away. One of them reeked alcohol and the others smoke near by. I'm never coming here again
