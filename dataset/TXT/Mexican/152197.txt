jxc3XS6v7J-_WHgYuaJ_cA Won't go back. 

Service: attentive 
Food: tasteless
Decor : pretty 
Order: Summerliciois menu
Watermelon soup: a room temperature non appetizing amalgam of chopped tomatoes , cucumbers, and onions in crushed watermelon. 
Salmon attempt at ceviche: tasteless.
Lamb entree: pretty presentation in a banana leaf cone. The lamb was stewed to perfection, completely tender. But unfortunately very heady and tasted Ethiopian and not Mexican. The side of beans in a taco shell was mushy and disgusting.
Dessert: mango mousse. Raw mangoes (the mouse was tart) puréed with cream that has collapsed- is not mousse. 
Caramel tart: meh.

Can't remember being this disappointed with a meal :(
