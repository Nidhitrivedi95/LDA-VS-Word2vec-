Ever since coming back to the states after living 2 years in Veracruz, Mexico, I'm always on the hunt for a legit taco place. The first time at La Unica I ordered one of each taco they had, and the Carnitas stood out among the rest. Personally I prefer Al Pastor, and while their's was good, it wasn't anything to rave about. But with one bite of the Carnitas I was teleported back to the streets of Veracruz. I have not tasted such authentic carnitas this side of the Rio Bravo. I wish I could review the rest of the menu, but all I've had in my subsequent visits has been either carnitas tacos of burritos. For the restaurant itself, the service is great, fast, and the pricing is very reasonable. Also, take-out is the way to go during the business hours. I called my order in on a busy Saturday night, and it was ready for me when I got there 10 mins later, complete with chips, salsa, cut limes, sauteed onions and jalapenos. Just like they do it in Veracruz.
