aYE-oZFvSOHsyAtcpf0frQ Very delicious!! Extremely quick service!! The staff are very friendly.  My husband and I will definitely be back. The place is on the smaller side but we were able to be seated immediately. We both had the chimichangas. I had the spicy chicken and he had the one that had steak, chicken and shrimp. Both amazing!  The chips and salsa are also very good! Can't wait to go back!
