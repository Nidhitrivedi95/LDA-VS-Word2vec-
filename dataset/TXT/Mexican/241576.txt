TCoBE_BkDRrK0bWrh5VueQ I've been to this place a couple times now and it's always been good, not fantastic, but not horrible. It's loud, sometimes crowded, but has a very fun atmosphere. Food is usually very good although today I had the barbacoa and it was mostly fat rather than meat which is extremely disappointing. The beans on the salsa bar were cold however the salsa bar was surprisingly clean.
