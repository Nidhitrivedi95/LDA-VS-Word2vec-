mBWx_YzT-ZQPqqPGcBsiwQ King's Tacos is one of my favourites. Located on St. Clair Ave W, it is a nice distance towards small boutiques and makes for a good stroll. The atmosphere inside is great, and the servers are very welcoming. A bit on the pricey side, but the food is filling, and requires a bit of interaction (think of make your own tacos), which is a nice touch. Reminds me of homemade cooking which I really liked. I have not tried their vegetarian menu yet, but the meat was well cooked and the sauces added a great touch. Nice authentic taste. Really enjoyed the experience. Perfect for a get together with your girlfriends.
