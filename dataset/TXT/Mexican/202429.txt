pomGBqfbxcqPv14c3XH-ZQ We were there on Saturday July 26,   we were sat down at a booth  and good 15 minutes went by.   No one came.  Then, another family came in and were served right away.  We ask the hostess who can help us. She said just a minute.  She went to the front and 10 minutes went by again and nothing.  Waiters keep ignoring us like we were not there.  Of course, we stood up and ask for the manager. The hostess said she is not in I requested to speak with some one.   The general Manager came out which I assume is the owner. We explained what have happened and she only said I AM SORRY!!!!! as we were leaving.................  POOR POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Also, the restaurant was dirty very dirty.   I would recommended not to go to this restaurant.........................
