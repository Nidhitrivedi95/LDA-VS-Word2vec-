t2eQcHc7WIlyKK8zFtY2Kw If you are in this neighborhood and get a hankering for a burrito, there is the original Boyz and the nee Bandidos that offer up finer, fresher ingredients at less of the price. The experience here is very Mr Pita of burritos. Kind of generic. The only redeeming quality about the burrito was the cilantro-tinged rice. Don't get me wrong, I didn't actually enjoy the rice. It was dried out and crispy. But the cilantro (what many Canadians call corriander) was the only flavor in the burrito.  Dried out and bland.
