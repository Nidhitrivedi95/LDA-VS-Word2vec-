Rj-7ymdw8aNZBRqGRAjR3Q AMAZING! Chips are fresh and the selection of salsas that they give you is outstanding, not to mention each one super delish! Only downside was that they are unlimited if you pay the additional $4.95 (first round is free), however, we didn't mind seeing we love our chips and salsa! It was worth it. They even packaged up chips and salsa for us to take to go. The steak fajitas were delicilous as well as my chile relleno. LOVED the cilantro lime rice. Had this buttery taste to it that I couldn't get enough of. Service was excellent as well. Will definitely be returning on our next Vegas trip!
