ybFJUdRaN4eCff-W3HHiEw Guess I wasn't prepared for this place. I got excited when I saw that there was a taco truck just around the corner from my neighborhood and decided to cruise down to give it a try. For the record, tacos are my favorite food, and I am a taco snob.

When I went inside the restaurant I immediately said "What the fuck?" Not what I was expecting at all. I was totally under-dressed and felt waaaay out of place. I decided to stick around to try some tacos. I took a seat at the bar and ordered carnitas tacos ($20). Well, someone needs to explain to the chef what carnitas actually are. I was served lamb tacos. Why not just write "lamb tacos" on the chalk board instead of calling it carnitas, which everyone knows is pork. Weird.

The tacos were okay. At three for twenty dollars it should have come with a massive side, or be ten tacos at two dollars each. Considering they used generic corn tortillas and just a couple small bits of meat, my small portion twenty dollar meal probably cost them 3 dollars to make. 

Maybe prices are better when the taco truck is running?
