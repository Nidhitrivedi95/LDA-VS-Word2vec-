MZRqxvBkJLjKcoOjNz7yLA Definitely don't recommend for breakfast . . .  We wanted a regular breakfast menu and asked one of the staff who said we should go here.

The menu was not a "regular breakfast menu" - we were looking for American, which we were led to believe by the staff person.  Main thing was regular breakfast combo's (eggs, meat, toast/pancakes) was not on the menu.  Seemed like lot of a la carte items and few other combos that were basically eggs, plus refried beans or potatoes.

We opted for Scrambled Eggs with Potatoes (blah, didn't finish) and a Breakfast Burrito surprisingly tasty!)
Relative to other places, this place is pricey for small breakfast.  It's minimum $10-13 per person (no drinks), and the 2 Eggs and Potatoes alone was $11.

Also, the guy hosting was not totally overt, but he was condescending.  Offered to sit us at the bar first (nobody else was there and there were tons of tables open) and when we asked for table, he sighed and led us to a booth next to a large noisy group (gee, thanks!).  Waitress was rather scattered . . . We saw the manager(?) serve food - She leaned over a kid across the large group's table to hand a plate to a woman - seriously?  Need to go to waitressing school!  (And, even though we almost ran into him, no "thanks for coming" - He definitely needs to learn about customer service or just get an attitude agjustment . . .)

Go do the buffet or head to Denny's or somewhere else.  We wouldn't come back to this place . . . And, given how happy they were to seat and serve us, we won't be back for any other meal either.
