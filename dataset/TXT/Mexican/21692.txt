I stopped by after 12:00 today and the place was empty .. Ordered the giant Jamaica and the chile verde (pork) combo with corn tortillas.. the pork was good but was swimming in way too much chile verde.. Rice and beans were your standard sides.. The corn tortillas though were like store bought steamed or warmed in a microwave .. No good because they get hard before you're half way done with your food.
