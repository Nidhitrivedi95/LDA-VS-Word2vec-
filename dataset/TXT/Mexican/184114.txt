Nr5TGaBoGraxbZBCzKyvuA It's hard to find cheap delicious food other than fast food chains late at night. But tucked in the middle of Chinatown LV you will find this quaint taco truck in an auto shop parking lot that offers great Mexican food! Stumbled across this place driving home after a concert at the T-Mobile Arena after midnight!

We ordered Al Pastor and Carne Asada tacos ($1.50/ea) and a Carne Asada quesadilla which came with a side salad ($5.00). For the price that these tacos are going for, I could eat these everyday! Definitely coming back to try other things on the menu! 

There are a few chairs for customers to enjoy their food and a salsa bar is available with various sauces and limes as well. Do not let the facade of this place fool you into thinking that what they serve isn't good!
