OPcGFLP_mRt9yvgP3ALXOQ We stopped last Wednesday and so glad we did!  Delicious Margaritas, great guac and chips with salsa to start.  The Tortilla soup really good and hearty.  Had the Tacos Al Pastor for dinner  - fantastic, they were seasoned just right with roasted pineapple and cilantro.  Good stuff.  We will be back.  Got free guac with the Yelp check in btw....
