BgQ5ob0QiZfO5YbgI7VyFw The Taos Combo was huge.  I usually don't prefer enchiladas, because they just have meat inside.  Well, I'm a fan of their shrimp enchilada.  It has a nice texture and pleasant flavor.  The tamale was enormous, with meat spilling out.  And the relleno was tastier than a typical relleno with a cheese filling.  The creme brulee had good taste.  The crust didn't shatter like I expected, perhaps it was a touch too thick.  Overall, a very pleasant experience!
