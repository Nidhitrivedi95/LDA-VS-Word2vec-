D17zqKVWM5BMC443mDVF4g Casa Maria is a local, family owned, restaurant in Chandler.  We typically choose small, local business when we can, and we were thrilled to have chosen this place!

Upon entering, we thought we may be ordering at the counter, but were escorted to a table and offered menus.  Upon being seated, our attention immediately shifted to cleanliness of the entire facility.  While there, we were able to meet Maria, the owner and mother to two sons, Luis (our waiter) and Raul (assisted Luis in delivering our meals).

Our meals included shrimp tacos, mini-chimis, enchiladas and a veggie burrito.  Everyone at our table enjoyed their meals, and left with a full belly.

Price was as expected, service may strike some as overly friendly, but it is exactly why we choose restaurants like this!!

Give local a chance, and plan to enjoy your visit to this new establishment.
