u1m3qTIrhZhwNjMT6n-M8g Don't waste your time or money. The server is the worst I've ever had in AZ and only 3 tables seated in the entire restaurant. We could have overlooked if the food was good but it was horrible other than the salsa. The shrimp was so overlooked and dried out I had to ask for a sauce to even eat it. It was way over priced too. No appetizer 4 meals a $60 Groupon and still $20 more!
