Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ So mad we wasted 90 dollars at this place. Made a reservation over A WEEK in advance b/c we live in Vegas and my considerate bf wanted to take us out for a nice brunch. Told the hostess I wanted a WINDOW seat and was willing to wait even though we had a reservation if it meant a window.  Wait 15 minutes and get taken to a table even though Im staring at 2 empty window seats. Tell the hostess what I originally said. wait 10 more minutes for a window. 2 window seats available. One still has not been bussed but is a much better seat. One is in the corner meaning one persons view is of the wall. Ask for the former. Again, willing to wait. She comes back and tells me "that table is already spoken for". Guess they spoke for it more than a week ago since I had the reservation and noone waiting for a table was ahead of us but tired of waiting. And I'll go ahead and add now that that table sat empty for over 30 minutes so I guess the hostess decided we weren't good enough for that table?   Waiter comes and is very nice, offers suggestions and we order drinks and food. Food comes about 15 minutes later and is wrong. WE NEVER SAW THE WAITER AGAIN! My boyfriend went ahead and ate his food b/c it was getting cold. But that waiter never came back. Some waitress started helping us when we HAD ALREADY FINISHED EATING, pretty much 20 minutes and 2 empty drinks later. I am literally making eye contact with our waiter and he never came back.   SOOOO... waitstaff is great -if you can find them, and food was really good-not what we ordered but we liked it. Overall service was so bad it isn't worth it. There are too many good places to eat to deal with this kind of thing in Vegas. I only give the 2 stars bc the food was really good. The service is BEYOND TERRIBLE.
