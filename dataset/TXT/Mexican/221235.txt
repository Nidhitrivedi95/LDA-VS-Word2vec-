rl137V_5Hx0cJAV4beVdhA I have to start by saying the tacos here are pretty darn good. Maybe some of the best I've had in the city so far. They do justice to the tortilla which can sadly be overlooked elsewhere. But... damn are they on the pricey side. Ranging from $5 - $7.50 I think you would need at least 3 to make a meal. I had two at lunch, plus sharing a guacamole with my lunching companions and I wasn't exactly 'too full'. The Carnitas was really good and the Barbacoa (braised Lamb) was pretty good as well (if not a touch on the salty side). Since when has the humble taco been turned into a luxury food? The service was good and the place is nicely appointed (maybe a little too nicely). 

But I have to say - please stop serving your beer pints in enamel tins cups! Maybe it looks cool (it doesn't), but every sip of beer is going to have a 'tin' taste to it. 

I will be back, but I have to save up some money first (and I'll bring my own beer glass).
