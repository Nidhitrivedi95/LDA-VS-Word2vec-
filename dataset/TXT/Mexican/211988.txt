qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A I went to DW Bistro last Sun, the food was great!! The simplicity decor in the restaurant really make me comfortable and relaxing.  The staff were extra friendly.  You have a really good crowd in the restaurant.  One thing that I don't 100% get was there were still around 5 tables left but we had still waited around 20 mins to be seated.  Overall experience was great.  Definitely a great gain for the SW area.  They might want to look into the wait, I dunno if they are trying to control the quality of service...but I do see many people left and came back for it.
