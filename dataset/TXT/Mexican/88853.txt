DO5mQxiBOgHEznosjxvJXw We were searching for a decent Mexican meal while vacationing in town.  We saw good reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try.   They started our meal with chips and salsa.  Now if all you've ever had is the standard salsa from mediocre run of the mill restaurants, then you might not like this salsa.  It was totally different than anything I've tasted.  The chips were also something different, more like fresh tortillas fried and seasoned.  I found I liked them alone, even without salsa.  I had a chicken burrito with tomatillo sauce and it was absolutely wonderful.  The chicken was seasoned well and had a wonderful smoked flavor.  Hubby had the fajita's .   Our server, Ruth was fantastic.  We had management stop by a couple of times to make sure our food was great.  We absolutely loved this place and would highly recommend it!
