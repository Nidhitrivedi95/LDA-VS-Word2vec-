Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ we came to tableau for saturday brunch and it was yummy!  its in the tower suites part of the wynn and the decor is the same as any other part of the wynn.  it faces the pool and i did wish it let in more sunlight.

i didnt care too much for the bread.  it came in little pots, cute presentation.  then they brought all the sauces.  homemade ketchup, tabasco, siracha, syrup, jam, butter etc.  those in themselves covered the whole table.  i ordered the eggs benedict and added sauteed spinach.  the hollandaise on it was super buttery and yummy and not too thich.  the ham on it was very salty and dry.

we also all shared the french toast which was delicious!  and the cookie soufle also divine!

our server was super nervous but it didnt ruin our meal.  the food did take a while to come out but it gave us time to chat.
