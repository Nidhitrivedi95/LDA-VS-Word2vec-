01JF2gJiPKa9MazZUiNtlQ I've gone to this place when they were a tiny little restaurant with 3-4 tables and a take-out section....boy how times have changed.Now that they own the entire corner of the plaza they have upsized their prices..don't get me wrong..this is the closest thing to REAL Mexican you will find without actually going to mexico. the food is fantastic!!! if u dont mind spending $13-$15 dollars...it just dissapointing to me becuase we would get the same dishes for $7-$8...I hate when places do that...but I understand that their costs go up.All in all I will go back and I have nothing but GREAT reviews for them! I always tell ppl to get mexican food there!!
