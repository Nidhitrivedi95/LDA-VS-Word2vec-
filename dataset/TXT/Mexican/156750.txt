khOsPUxJuf5R3cmgiZnk6g Never thought there would be a Korean style churros. I'm actually not a fan of authentic churros cause I don't like cinnamon, but I'm a fan of this Korean style churros. $3.50 for original, or $4.50 to add a glaze and topping. I had it with condensed milk and Oreo crumbs. Was really tasty! The outside was nice and crispy but slightly soft inside. Love condensed milk, was a perfect combo with the Oreo crumbs. When you get to the very bottom is where I could really taste the cinnamon sugar since the glaze and toppings don't get all the way to the bottom. Really good size for it's price. A great grab and go kind of snack!

P.S. the owner is Mr. Park, not Mr. Chu
