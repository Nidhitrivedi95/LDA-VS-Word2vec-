I had the pork and cheese pupusa, with a Salvadorian style elote and it so good I had to force myself not to order 2 more... The food is great, and the staff is super friendly, I definitely recommend this place. Its not just a fruit and smoothie place, because their food is better than other restaurants in the area and its affordable.
