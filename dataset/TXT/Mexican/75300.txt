cIRZU99i82ReJxCqhgXc5g Hot Dang! I mean, hot dog! I'm not usually a hotdog fan but even if you're a hot dog hater this place will blow your mind. They take the term "Gourmet Hot Dogs" to a whole new level. I got the New Mexico dog which has green chile, salsa, cream cheese, majaca cheese and I forget what else on a very home made tasting bun. Simply amazing!

The dogs themselves are huge too! But the prices are small. They have a great variety as well, many dogs to choose from for every taste and don't forget to try their award winning salsa. Very friendly service too! I was skeptical coming here and they quickly won me over. 

Highly recommended!!
