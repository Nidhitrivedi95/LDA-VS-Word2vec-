D3MfMrIoNV4_aXPj0bi1BQ Since Michael Hershmann arrived we have been back a number of times and each visit has been enjoyable. It's not that it was bad before, it was just average. The last visit offered a wonderful Salmon special. The Gouda Grits side dish was so good it could almost ( almost) be a main dish. 

This place has been in Cleveland Heights for years and after that time you might assume a sloppy result. Not so. They remain very on-game.
