7GGJlp1aWfcXGQz6q7SkXQ Should have known to keep walking when so much of the staff is put outside the hotel to entice people to come in for lunch but we were hungry and it looked cool enough so we took the chance. I wouldn't return. The service was the bare minimum and the food (from the very limited menu) wasn't great. I had the fish tacos and the mahi was so over cooked and dry I ate half of one. Oddly the fries were undercooked. There are so many great places to go in Vegas and around the Venetian there is no reason to waste your dollars here. Gave two stars instead of one because of the music.
