1HfkEkNhI6XJXkgrCTBKpw We went for brunch and I was super impressed with the beer selection and service and would definitely come back again for drinks. I wasn't as impressed with the food- the tortilla with Manchego was surprisingly lacking in flavor. However, the beer cheese dip that my friend got later was pretty good so I wouldn't be against trying the food again.
