tXqaK0lBEE1XJbzDPsdFvg This used to be my favorite fast food place until went to the drive-through and saw the guy wiping his nose with his hand and serving the food. Yuck! Eewww! When they first opened they were great! They also serve me cold fries and when I asked for them to be hot they re-cook the cold ones. You understand what I'm saying they double dip them in the grease. I will not be going back anymore.
