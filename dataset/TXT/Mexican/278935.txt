XpyYSWF-8xi_aZ67RUuk2Q My boyfriend and I moved to the area a few months ago and finally decided to try this place for Happy Hour on a Friday. 

Right after we sat down at a booth in the bar area, we received chips, three types of salsa, and carafe of ice water. After a few minutes, our waitress Rikki (based on our receipt) took our drink orders and then brought us menus. She gave a good impression by being very personable and seemed to have a fun personality. 

The menu wasn't very big, which is fine I guess, but there was not an option to order a combination meal such as 1 taco and 1 enchilada so I just got the two cheese enchiladas meal. A guy with a short ponytail delivered our food by saying "hello" like it was a question and then left (I overheard him say this to another table so I guess it's just his thing). I was ready for another beer (it's happy hour!) but I never saw Rikki again until she dropped off the check. 

While I was eating, a young boy came by and cleaned the windows on the door that was directly next to me, which in turn sprayed some glass cleaner ON my food. Before the spray, the enchis were decent and the rice was really good. My boyfriend ordered fries and rice with his tacos but only rice showed up and Rikki wasn't around to tell.

As we ate, booths started filling up but there were two servers in the bar area so I see no reason for her never coming back. I did notice a couple of the other groups were known by name so perhaps because we are not regulars that we did not deserve as good of service.

In the future we may try this place again, but not anytime soon.
