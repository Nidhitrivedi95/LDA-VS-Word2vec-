We ordered supreme fries which was really supreme. Hot fries with glucamole, mushrooms and pico. 
And we ordered burger combo with coke. The burger was really good, crunchy with some onions and fresh lettuce. The patty was tasty. 

The prices are reasonable for vegan food. 

The portions were really sumptuous. We had to get a to go box for fries.
