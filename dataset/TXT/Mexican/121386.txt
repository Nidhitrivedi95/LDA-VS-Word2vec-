h4Q-uSoOIhMoIsOhat6l3A First time there had free entree coupon from local mailer.  Enjoyed a great heuvos rancheros.  Excellent three layers with sautéed onions and strips of grilled peppers - most tasty. Instead of tortillas the layers were made of the same pastry as the taco bowls!! Very much enjoyed their take on a simple southwest breakfast.  
The chips and guacamole were very tasty we ended up being offered to take home the balance of our chips and salsa for later.  Happy hour during the week from 4-6 with some good looking deal. Definitely plan to come back to try that.  Enjoyed some tap beer, cold and good size portions.
