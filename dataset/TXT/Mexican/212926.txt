Even though I was very disappointed by La Fiesta, I love love love love La Taqueria. The choices are awesome, the food is fresh and the service is always super friendly and helpful! I've been here several times and have yet to be disappointed. There is one worker here in particular (I wish I knew his name) that is always so incredibly nice and always in such a great mood, puts you in a good mood too! I suggest trying a quesaritto, sooooo good! SO MANY MORE OPTIONS THAN CHIPOTLE!
