svdEhLmNmpVaIv1WLtoOvQ If you have never had real Mexican food then you will find this place acceptable. If you don't mind paying for your chips and salsa or $7-10 for a beer, then hey that's ok. If you don't mind watered -down salsa or guacamole that taste like its from the grocery store, then go ahead and go in. This place is nothing but a trendy over-priced hipster place. If you just want a place to meet friends off the strip then  it's ok but if you're looking for real Mexican food, this place is not it.
