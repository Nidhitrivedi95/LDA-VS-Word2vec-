GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog This my second time here and literally the only thing I enjoy in Vegas. For my second trip, i was fortunate enough to drop in during restaurant week, 4 course meal for $30---$5 of which go to charity. The pictures say it all. DELICIOUS and tasteful presentation. I loved everything and the service was delightful! Looking forward to my third visit!
