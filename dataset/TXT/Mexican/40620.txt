6tu5q1pgP7sfDpTY9Vq7GQ Bland Burrito is more like it. I mean they're not the worst things you'll ever have and are certainly more than edible. But that's about it. Having tried both the veggie soy and the bean and cheese (I'm a vegetarian) I can safely say these are among the blandest, most dry burritos I've ever tasted. I had to add half a jar of salsa / burrito sauce just to make the things palatable. The ingredients are fresh and the burritos are technically well made. The flavor just isn't there.

And no, it's not just the veggie options. Family members have had the chicken, steak and fish burritos and had the exact same complaints. Burrito Boyz, Mucho Burrito, Taco del Mar, Fat Bastard Burrito and pretty much all the others are more interesting choices. If I didn't have those as a frame of reference perhaps I'd think Bar Burrito was just fine but as it is, they just don't quite make the grade.
