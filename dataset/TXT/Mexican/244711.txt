People defintely make the difference here -- all but one fully conversant in English and knowledgeable about mainly Mexican food experiences.  The one who wasn't was behind the butcher counter, but another exployee translated for him!  Fresh pastries, decent produce section, even a "We Buy Gold" jewelry store inside.
