The only negative is that they only take cash even though its 2016 -____- so you have to pay the ATM fee to take out your money to pay your bill. So just bring cash when coming here and you'll be fine and leave with a happy full belly. 

-to the person complaining that they don't tell you its a cash only establishment, there is actually a big sign that's facing all the tables and if I'm not mistaken more than one around the restaurant saying they take cash only.
