_u1Bq7QsgMUXSMex8QHqLQ Hangover food of choice tonight - Burrito Boyz!  Had a small halibut burrito to share.

Generous generous portion sizes... I seriously don't know how people can eat a large!  Just half of a small was a meal for me!  The halibut burrito is my all-time favourite. The fish is very tender and juicy! I also like that they give you the whole wheat option on the wrap! I got my burrito with all the fixings: guacamole, lettuce, tomato, rice, jalapeño, medium hot sauce, and beans.

Gorilla Sprinkles got a steak burrito which he enjoyed!

My only "beef" was that they wouldn't cut it in half for me because "we can't we're too busy." so deduct one star.
