Ok9vikKusbG_Ue9pJf6s3Q Great taco place! Four of us shared some guacamole, beans and grilled green onions as appetizers! We ordered the rib eye taco, carnita and the special of the day ( fried shrimp in coconut batter). The rib eye was ok, the carnita and shrimp were the stars! Awesome and original drinks and great service!
