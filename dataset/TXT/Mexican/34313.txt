4vm2W7J_ztH0vcX4bKfuXw Never have I been in a Mexican taco joint with jazz music playing in the background and it was great. I'm surprised it was dead at lunch on a Tuesday but food came out fast fresh. The carne asada nachos are a tower of delishishness with the red and cheese sauce. I'm drooling thinking about my next trip back.
