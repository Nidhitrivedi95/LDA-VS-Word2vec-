iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg Everything is good but know this:
-cash only 
-tiny space, expect a line up 
-nowhere to sit and eat 
-the hot sauce is very deliciously hot 

We ordered the baha fish taco and the mixed seafood ceviche tostada. Both were excellent, very fresh, and good value - gourmet taste. 

Also very good that the inside is air conditioned
