oN_A87dyVD2FBk7coLnhCg Well deserved 5 stars. He has a passion for his food, and it shows in the quality. Fresh beans, yummy rice. Real corn and flour tortillas, meat tastes amazingly well seasoned and marinated to perfection. Today was huevos rancheras, and it was divine. You're doing great man, wait is well worth it for my belly to be this happy. Two thumbs up, I'll always be back.
