Q7bAF6MrZ8wWfLsxaPl2Yw I've been to plenty of taco shops all over AZ and I have to say hands down these are the best carne asada tacos i have had, period. So much flavor in the meat and the salsa bar compliments the tacos great. Taco de cabeza was also very good but the asada was the best. Horchata was good but a little sweeter than I'm used to. Being the best carne asada tacos you would expect the prices to be high but it was very cheap here. You will not be disappointed, guaranteed.
