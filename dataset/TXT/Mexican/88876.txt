For desserts we tried the mango mousse and chocolate cake .The location is beautiful in the newly remodeled Boulevard Mall. There are two entrances , one from the street, and one from the mall so it's easy to access. 

There is a beautiful, large bar that is the centerpiece of the modern and fast paced restaurant.
