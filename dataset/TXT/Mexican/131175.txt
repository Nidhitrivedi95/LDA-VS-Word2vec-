iBlQvqiy5Rg2h-y9TS1yOA First time visiting Casa Del Matador in Downtown Summerlin.  First impression...the atmosphere is open and airy which is nice.  It went downhill from there. We requested a booth and were seated promptly.  However, the booths are just wooden benches and not comfortable at all.  Maybe they don't want you to linger and chat during your meal.  Complementary chips were too thick and quite salty. The salsa was ok but spicy.  Ordered the taco salad with chicken.  You can't go wrong with taco salad right?  Wrong....worst taco salad ever!!!  Dark meat chicken (yuck), black beans hard as rocks and the sour cream had something green mixed in it that made it runny and weird tasting.  On top of the salad were pickled carrots!!  Really? On a taco salad?  My ice tea was very diluted and tasteless.  Needless to say we won't be back which is sad because we love good mexican food.
