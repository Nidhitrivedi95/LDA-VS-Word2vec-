pomGBqfbxcqPv14c3XH-ZQ I was craving birria at lunch & didn't wish go to usual spots for it. 
Its an upscale restaurant w authentic food that isn't watered down or Americanized.
Their chips come with  homemade salsas that are outstanding.. avocado & fire roasted  are standouts. I wanted something w some more heat & my server Natalie suggested the homemade habaneros salsa, which filled my desire.
Its not on their menu and they have something else also w more heat, the habaneros did it for me.

The birria came w rice beans & tortillas, the meat was was wonderfully seasoned & tasty w no bone or fat w the tasty gravy. I want to experience the rest of their menu because it was the birria was perfect, easily the best I've had it cooked. My server Natalie was on top of every need or request  as well the others on her team.. Definitely will explore their cuisine again.
