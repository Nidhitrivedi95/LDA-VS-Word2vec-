TH34Fsp9fkARGhKa6u3qrQ Liz rules, super nice and friendly girl who works there, will remember you and always smiling happy and looks out for the regulars.  Tuesdays are awesome for taco tuesday, I would recommend a special order, ask for the beef tacos but in soft corn and add onion and cilantro, so it will have lettuce cheese onion and cilantro, then you can squeeze on some lemon or lime and I'd go with the green and roasted salsas or whatever you like.  The food is good and affordable the whole staff is very nice and friendly and the Horchata is amazing :)
