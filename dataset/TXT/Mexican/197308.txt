When I called to make a reservation (which they don't take for small parties), they never informed us the entire main restaurant was closed for a private party.  Our only seating options were inside the bar area or outside on the patio in the 107 degree heat. My boyfriend's parents can't sit in 100+ temperatures.  The bar area we were seated in, wreaked of a wet, dirty bar.  Exactly what you'd expect.  I asked for chips & salsa (standard at almost all other Mexican restaurants).  Was told it was an appetizer.  I ordered the $6.00 chips & salsa and the generous portion of chips were old & stale.  The salsa was watered down & tasteless.  The homemade tortillas with flavored butter are still very good.  I ordered the Old Town Tacos and my boyfriend's parents ordered the Sonoran Meatloaf.  The food was decent but the overall experience was average.  There are too many great restaurants in this area of Scottsdale, to settle on this spot.
