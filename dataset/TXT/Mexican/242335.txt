Te-BqwJZt8S0fu9ltlq3Eg So, you pass a place for years and you just never think about...

I'd been driving by the location for Los Gallos for ages, just not thinking about it, until the other day when my wife suggested that we stop off.

I'm glad we did. Los Gallos is a very small place, located at a corner off of Broadway in Bedford, right near the railroad tracks. It's parking lot is wicked-small, just like the place, but when you get inside...there's the food:)

We got served really well, and even the chips and salsa, both made on site, were a pleasure to eat (we actually got a take away box...just for the chips.) 

I got a chicken taco salad, my wife got a combo with the BEST mole' sauce I have ever tasted. My salad was so good that I ate it right into oblivion:) 

Service was good, and the place has a dark, intimate atmosphere. I've heard some other folks had service problems; not us. Hell, my wife actually tipped THE CHEF that day because the food was so impressive. 

Again, the place is a little time-worn, but that experience translates into good food and a nice place to take someone and have quiet dinner. 

So, Los Gallos gets a thumbs up from us; if you're stopping through Bedford, and see their red brick building on the corner, stop in for a meal, I think you'll find that it's worth it:)
