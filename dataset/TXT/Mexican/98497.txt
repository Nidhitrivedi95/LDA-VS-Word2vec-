This place can fill up on busier nights and the servers are typically running their butts off to make sure everyone is well taken care of.  I feel like now that I know what to order here I love it even more.  My go-to's are: pad thai, velvet chicken quesadilla with a side of guac, Caribbean fries (plantains), steak fried rice and the miso soup with the additional sprouts. They offer "big plates" which live up to the name and could feed a small army.  Their margaritas are the best in Cleveland because they use fresh juices. There are vegan/vegetarian options.  The crowd is always diverse and cool.  Definitely check this place out!
