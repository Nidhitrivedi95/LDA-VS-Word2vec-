Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg I don't know why this place won awards. I ordered the chicken mole enchiladas. The sauce was sweet and bland. The texture of the chicken was all wrong, like it was made with sauteed fajita strips instead of shredded poached chicken. The rice and beans were flavorless. The complimentary bowl of noodle soup tasted like nothing but MSG.
