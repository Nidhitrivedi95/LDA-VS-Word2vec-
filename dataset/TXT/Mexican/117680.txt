gOpOoZgrF2shRLCBBzO3Mw Ok I'm so sorry, I got this confused with backyard taco in Gilbert on S Higley Rd. I loved the Burrito Shack. Its an inside outside place and the food is made with simple ingredients and they are put together with such care and thoughtfulness and when you bite into the food it sings. When I get a chance I always look into the kitchen and I could see the that they are a day to day operation and that makes me smile. My wife whom loves Mexican food fell in love with this place. I learned a long time ago pretty walls and the best kitchen does not mean the best food. Places that have been around forever tell their own story. 

Please go, you will not be disappointed.
