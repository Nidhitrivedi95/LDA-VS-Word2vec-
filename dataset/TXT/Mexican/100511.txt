eSENXDnnNSo-MLLkWJQ8Vg The food isn't as good as the location on 16th street. The Glendale location is either understaffed and can't accommodate busier days or the staff isn't that great. Either way my biggest complaint is customer service. We waited a good 15-20min and no one ever came to give us menus let alone take any drink order. We ended up leaving and I'm pretty sure no one even noticed. It's disappointing as I was really excited to see a location open closer to my house. The service is great at the 16st location but normally has a wait for seating as it is a smaller location. Needless to say, I won't be returning to the Glendale location.  I'd rather wait for a table and have better service and food.
