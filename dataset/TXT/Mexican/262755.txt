vz8HFGsITt6aj-nyXkAEFg We went on a night when it looked like it was going to rain, so I was nervous because we were sitting outdoors.  Luckily, the rain never came, and we were able to enjoy one of the few cooler summer nights.  This was actually my second time here.  We came here because we were with children, and watching and feeding the ducks can be very entertaining for kids.  The food and drinks were good.  The whole experience was great, except for the fact that I had to watch children throwing food at ducks (do parents parent anymore).  There should be some type of rules of the restaurant on how to behave around the pond.  The children there were a bit out of control.....otherwise, great experience.
