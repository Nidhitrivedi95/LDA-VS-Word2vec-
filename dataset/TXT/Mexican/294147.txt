z38AL1If2XDQhxh3Ioan3A A little while back I stopped in during breakfast hours. I am not a regular so when I do stop I need to see the menu. I was first in line and waited while several employees scurried about. And I waited, and I waited... Might not have been bad if there was a menu anywhere with breakfast items to look at but there wasn't.

I then asked people in line behind me. They shrugged (possibly a language problem).

So I left. I went to the corporate website and registered my concern. Crickets. Nothing. I can only assume customer relations is not one of their priorities.

I still give it two stars since maybe the food is ok, I wouldn't know.
