KbhrsTQEea2RF_94YWnBdQ Awesome food for great price.  Signed up for Yelp just to review.  I've had the Crazy Burrito, Pollo con Crema, and the Arroz con Polo.  All were very good, but I think the Arroz con Pollo is my favorite.  Bed of rice, with grilled chicken mixed with mushrooms, onions and some queso.  Comes with flour tortilla, chips, and salsa on side.  a LOT of food.  Don't let the location scare you.  It's a small place, and gets quite busy during lunch hour.  Usually have to wait 15-20 minutes so call ahead for takeout.
