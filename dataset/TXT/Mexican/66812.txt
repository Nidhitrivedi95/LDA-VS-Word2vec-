Bf2fuqWbHd3L-X69FSMvmg I've been here a couple of times now and this is one of those consistent "good-for-the-price" kind of spots.  

For me, I've had a lot of taco eating experience in the US so I didn't find these tacos particularly amazing in comparison but still good.  In a place like NYC or Cali, this place would struggle to be average, this is why I have a hard time giving 4 stars.  

But I still think this place is worth checking out if you are looking for quick, cheap Mexican food.  They seem to have all the basics you would expect in a taco joint in a fun, casual atmosphere.
