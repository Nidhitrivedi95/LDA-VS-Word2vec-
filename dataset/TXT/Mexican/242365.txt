TEaBolNAkOdRm2gvIYz4OQ I use to come here a lot with family, and the food is delicious, but the customer service is a hit and miss. There  needs to be consistency with how diners are greeted. My complaint is about the lack of customer service I received yesterday. I called my order in over the phone, and when I arrived to pick it up; I was told that it would be coming out shortly. 30 minutes later....yes 30 minutes (although I called ahead) I had to ask one of the ladies behind the to-go counter where was my food. She asked me for my order, and once I repeated it; she said "Oh here it is; sorry about that ma'am." So basically I waited outside for 30 minutes for my food that was ready and just sitting on the counter. She was so engrossed in her conversation with her co-workers that she forgot to call my order??  I can't with this place...bad customer service can ruin a business reputation, and it seems that SOME of the employees there are on a mission to do just that.
