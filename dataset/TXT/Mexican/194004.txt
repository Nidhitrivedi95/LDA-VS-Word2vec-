Or7FgbgY8ML30zgYj_DCwA We came here on Sunday with family for dinner. I have been to this place before approx 1 year ago, however I was very disappointed this time. Our waiter was okay, but he screwed up the order couple of times. As usual, place is always packed on weekends. We got wrong items couple of times, food was pretty bland and tasteless. 

I don't think I will ever come back again to this restaurant. There are many good Mexican authentic restaurant in Toronto.
