0r1Ow0HYAAjU7oM_2ePN6g As the others mentioned, Bull River Taco has been a long-awaited update to the Murray Ave. restaurant repertoire. One of the endearing but slightly frustrating aspects of Squirrel Hill restaurants is that while we have great variety of food available, there is a lack of quick take-out options for people on the go. This little place is a promising remedy. 

I tried the chicken and veggie tacos with my sisters a couple nights ago. I stopped in on my way home from work, and was in and out in about 10 minutes. The staff were friendly, and they worked quickly. The store was out of nachos, which was one of the items I had hoped to try, so no word on those yet. We thought the ingredients tasted fresh, and the seasoning on the shredded chicken was balanced and well done. I also appreciated the use of corn tacos and real queso cheese -- something I grew to enjoy while living in California and which has been difficult to find on the East Coast. 

All in all, this is a great place to grab a quick, reasonably-priced lunch or dinner with a much more authentic and satisfying taste than larger taco chains. I hope this new restaurant is successful, as I will most certainly want to go back!
