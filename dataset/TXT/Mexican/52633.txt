9jdlzH0HjU9_Fi3D-_a6gA Service was friendly but food was totally nasty. I have NEVER seen a burro with canned roast beef and gravy filling. My taco/fajita special was sooo nasty. Mayonnaise on it was gross, bland and made it taste like taco bell. Manager asked me if it was "too spicy" when server tried to get it removed from our ticket. Soooo funny b/c all the food is bland anglosized "mexican" food. Spicy would have actually been welcome.
