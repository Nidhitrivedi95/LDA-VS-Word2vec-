XMrLwzmEAsfNpbKRC7vUzQ 35-cent pints- fantastic promo. Did they even make money on this?? I mean, with some of those drafts on the special they had to be losing anywhere between .40- $1 on each pint..? I don't know, more curiosity than anything else.

I'm glad they came up with such a fresh promo though, they definitely attracted some new clientele, which I feel they needed. 

It really isn't a bad sports bar. The food is fairly decent but I feel it's overpriced in proportion to quality. I'd much rather be at a Saucer or Wild Wing Café. I used to like BWW too but they have since gotten greedy too.

I've been here a handful of times, service definitely could've been better almost every time. 

The beer card definitely comes in handy if you frequent this place. The beer prices are average. I can't recall exactly but I thought I they could've had better specials during the week.

Overall, just such generic bar food. If it was priced better, it would probably be in my top 5 frequent stops on the way home from the office.
