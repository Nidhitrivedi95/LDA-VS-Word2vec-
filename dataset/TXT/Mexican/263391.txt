W537pidoTVQmn9x1GPpxgA I had the Fish Tacos and they were good but not to die for. You had your choices of sauce to put on them which again was ok and the prices were really reasonable.. The bad was with the drink is only a small can of pop or small cup water vs I want enough liquid to wash it down. You sit outside so the tables could use a bit more cleaning, Overall I would go back in the near future.
