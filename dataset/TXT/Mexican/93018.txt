e2ApirIzYID9xIye0r_gKQ I don't get the bad reviews. Ate here many many times and the food is always excellent. Orders have never been messed up and if it was I'm positive they would fix it. Should definitely try it if you haven't already.

Another great breakfast by Farmer Boys! Everything was delicious as can be. Employees made us feel so welcomed and valued. There's is absolutely nothing bad about our visit today. Is and will always be our favorite breakfast place in town. Keep up the good work! See ya soon.
Highly recommend: 
-3 egg breakfast sunny side up, white toast, bacon and hash browns.
- chili cheese fries with onion's are always delicious.
- any shake on the menu
