qWi9dNGo9D9I4F9RANc-6g For the Mexican Food Lovers:

This place is a Must Try! Located in Lakewood, on Detroit Rd. The food is awesome. I had the Duck Leg Confit Tamales with Pork Belly Refried beans. And their special House Habanero Sauce! My girlfriend had the Braised Short-rib Tamales with their pepas fritas (a simple yet delicious order of thin cut fries with  "chimichuro sauce" and grated cheese)... Ugh. So much food, so much flavor, so delicious! 
Their selection of fresh salsa and fresh guacamole with chips is also a must try - I had the Tomato Chile salsa and Goat Cheese Guac. 

Full service bar, plenty of margaritas and Mexican beers to choose from! 

This place is awesome and we will definitely be back for more soon!
