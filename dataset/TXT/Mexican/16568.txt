1dV3qNEv8nNUAX1k3qdE2w I have been to this location several times already and I'm very happy that it opened a Chandler location.  It's relatively new so I feel some of the posts on service may be due to that, although I'll tell you that I've never experienced bad service.  We were seated promptly and the staff was courteous.

I agree with the other reviews that visually it's exactly what you want to be surrounded by as you sip a margarita.

The best part really is the food.  It's not the typical Mexical food formula, it's creatively put together and delicious.  The Baja menu section is really my favorite part.  The Shrimp Mazatlan is amazing.  The kids menu is also very good.  I've been there as a part of a large family group and on a date and it works either way.
