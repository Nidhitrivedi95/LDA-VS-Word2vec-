c_XbaJqhm-5ycSBOkVUBmg Tacos are in my top 3ish favourite foods so when I go to taco joints, my expectations are always high.

Don Taco underwhelmed me. I ordered 2 of the ground beef tacos (because it's a classic and will usually be the best gauge for a taco establishment) and a chicken taco. My friend ordered 2 vegetarian tacos.

My tacos weren't terrible but I probably could've just saved myself the disappointment and bought one of those Old El Paso taco mix boxes and gotten better results. My friend seemed to enjoy his vegetarian tacos though so maybe I missed something.

Probably won't come back.
