br2M2b-CsXI0HY0RXvHl0w Easily the best place in Mississauga for Mexican food, decent value and tastes great too. Tacos run about 8+tax for two, 9 for salmon, but I recommend the haddock tacos. I've tried fajitas here as well and can say theirs pretty good, but they are a bit stingy on the meat for the fajitas so I wouldn't recommend those, they cost about 14.99. The payment system is a bit unique, but it makes a more comfortable dining experience, you order at a counter and they give you a little tray of chips and salsa which is complementary with every meal, then you grab a drink, seat yourself, and the food comes to you and you pay at the register. Overall, really friendly folk here, decent value, and great tasting food. They also try to make the food look good too with their plating and presentation.
