I0MvTPpCr9PQVvthLdAyPA I was on my way to meet some friends at a Mexican restaurant in Whitby when they called and said the place was closed. We already in Whitby and had Mexican food on our minds so a quick search brought us to Los Cabos.

Our server brought us a complimentary bowl of nachos and salsa to start and we also ordered the guacamole. The guacamole was a bit bland but it was a lot better after we added some lemon juice, salt, pepper, and hot sauce.

For entrees, we ordered the Big D's Burrito Platter with beef, the Caribbean Mahi-Mahi, and the Ensenada Enchiladas with chicken. The enchiladas and burrito were huge portions! My companions said they tasted good.

I had the mahi-mahi and I had some issues with the dish. Some of the rice was crunchy, as in burnt. The fish "filet" had some bones in it. I know, it's fish, it can happen. Beyond the tropical salsa topping, however, the fish didn't have much flavour. It could have used more seasoning.

I probably won't be back for the food but if I'm in the area, I may drop in for drinks.
