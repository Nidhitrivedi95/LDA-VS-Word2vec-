4kDLEb1OgE7IrO54lCkn3A Confused feelings. Maybe my expectations were too high. Also the price point makes absolutely no sense - it's way too expensive for what you get. See below.

It's a small but cozy place. I'm sure the service could have been good, but I went at an odd time and the waiter disappeared to help other employees with something.

Food was on the more authentic side (less Tex Mex) but still kinda meh. 
Salsas: delicious. Had a classic spicy tomato salsa and a jalapeno salsa. Habanero salsa was also there, but given the spice of the normal ones, I didn't venture to try it...
Chicken tinga tostadas: Good flavor, quite spicy (I'm Indian and eat spicy food, and this was still pretty spicy, so gringos beware)
Camarones de guajillo (shrimp): I found these quite flavorless. I'm natually biased against shrimp you have to peel and devein yourself because your hands smell for hours and it's a lot of work. But the sauce itself also wasn't impressive. 
Tres leches cake: I love tres leches, so this was the highlight. Not as sweet/dense as some other places, but sometimes you don't need the extra cream anyway!

Overall, glad I tried it, but I would at least order a different main dish. But it's also more expensive than it's worth. I was pretty confused why my bill here was almost as much as my bill at Richmond Station and as much as my bill at Los Colibris ("fine dining" Mexican).
