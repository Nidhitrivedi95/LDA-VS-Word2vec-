GrwvBAEALujIOPQeOfN1vA I'm giving this a 3 because I feel that a 3 is a generous rating. First of all, let's talk of seating. If I wanted to have a community meal with strangers I would say eff it and join a hippy colony on the beach and say eff it to hygiene and share finger food with people who haven't showered since Watergate. SECONDLY let's talk food, the food...oh the food. Plain, greasy, over portioned, and slapped on a plate with some dry rice and some quick boiled black beans. The options in the menu are disguised into giving you choices but they're all practically the same. The spicy menu that they warn you about has warm bland Americanized Mexican food. The service was even more of a disappointment, the woman had attitude and had us repeat practically everything we ordered after she would leave for several minutes. It was shocking, but I can see where some crave the mediocrity of food. For me, I'd rather go to the Spotted Donkey or Hancienda over this place.
