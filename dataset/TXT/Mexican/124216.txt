HOlDxrYqfoJrVq2Eo-_LKQ Unbelievably BAD. If the bacon is locally sourced, then the poor pigs are starving. The egg (I didn't want three eggs, but of course I paid the same amount for one egg) was floating in grease. Tomatoes, on the side were tragic. Coffee was bland, OJ was tolerable, but if it is fresh-squeezed, oranges used must be dry, and withered.

And to top it off this mess cost $15.00 smackeroos. For gawd's sake go to any, and I mean any other breakfast spot (including Mickey D's)
