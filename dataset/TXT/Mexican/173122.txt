mFGUvyJSdSRjIaN94QW_IQ Totally perfect place to hide! It is in a strip mall, but do not be fooled this place is amazeballs! Walked in from the street side, and immediately you are in Mexico! Totally cool atmosphere, great chairs great Decor, couldn't say more about it! The host was in an especially great mood, sat us down super fast, and then the waitress took over and again great customer service! Got an opportunity to order the perfect margarita,(order the skinny, which is the real deal! Agave, Triple Sec, lime juice and tequila!) Great tequila selection, and amazing Foods, including real Hatch Green Chile items! I got an opportunity to taste the Menudo, no joke, best menudo I've ever tasted! The hominy had a nice home-made taste, a little toasty, super-delish! Got the crispy tacos, and they were just OK., not bad but in hindsight I think I'm going to go for the street tacos next time! I also ordered the relleno, and it was okay, again not bad, and I'll order it definitely again, but it was just ok. The one thing this place is missing, is a good salsa. I tried several that they had and unfortunately they just have a good spicy flavorful salsa that I could enjoy. That however, did not take away from my experience! This is really good food in the middle of North Glendale! Anyway, such a blessing to be able to eat here tonight! If you do one thing while you're in Glendale, come check this place out!
