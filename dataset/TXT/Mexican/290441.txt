Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ My husband and I treated ourselves to an amazing breakfast at Tableau. We were seated outside, surrounded by the pool and gardens at Wynn, listening to the birds chirp and the smell of fresh air. Having spent a couple of days on The Strip by this point, it felt like we had been transported to a different place entirely! Welcome to classy Vegas.

The sour sream and banana pancakes were excellent - the best pancakes I have ever had! Each bite literally melted in my mouth. It is a large order so you might want to get it to share. The house made granola with greek yogurt and fruits was also fantastic. Some of the freshiest berries I have ever had. And to think that we were in the middle of the dessert! The Valencia Mimosas are top notch. I followed it with a regular Mimosa to compare and there was definitely a major difference! The Valencia Mimosa is so fresh - you can't get it in too many places!

I can't wait to return to Vegas just to eat here!!!
