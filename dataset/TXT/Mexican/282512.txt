XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg OMG seriously we had an amazing meal at Mesa!  Being from the Bay Area and having access to amazing restaurants I was very impressed.  My group had the following:
- Rib Eye- 5 Stars
- Lamb - 5 stars
- Lobster tacos - 3 stars, very good, small plate of 3 mini tacos 
- Scallops - 3 stars, good
- Chopped salad - 2 stars, good, but not great
- Onion rings - 2 stars 
- Glass of Chardonnay-1 star...mediocre 
- Service 4 Stars

Overall our group was seriously delighted. We ate at Gorden Ramsey's place the night before (the Irish Pub restaurant) and there was no comparison in overall quality.  I would recommend to anyone in the area to visit.
