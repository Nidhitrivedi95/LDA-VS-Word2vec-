kqTek_oBEKOKpIHI12JYhQ I love the atmosphere of this place (a large old house). I had a great burrito, which was HUGE and was a good price. It was slightly too spicy for me, so I'd order it a bit milder next time. The sweet potato was interesting, but I might try something else instead next time. I love that any of the menu options can be made vegan.

Service was friendly and laid back, and fluent in English.
