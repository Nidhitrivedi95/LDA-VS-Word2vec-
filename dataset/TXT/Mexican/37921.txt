6-IfbXLjCYBw03WJqoV9CA This place used to be good until I noticed how gross it is, let me explain my self. I'm not sure if the employees here are trained well, if they were then they  should know that when they are preparing food they should not touch their clothes or face or cleaning products and so on. Their prep station is messy the employees do not change gloves between customers.  I have seen an employee grabbed a day and cleaned an area with the gloves she is wearing and went back to the line prepping for the next customer, gross. The rag they use is the rag used your clean tables and prep  area  ,you can literally smell  the table that smells like a dried wet dirty rag, gross almost armpity scent. They sweep the floor while you are eating ,omgosh  I hate that so much. You do know when they sweep they are moving all kinds of dust allergens pathogens  etc. That's why when one sneeze you think they are sick ,no way, that's just being dirty. This is why I give this place and a bunch other chain food joints in town. So people everything you go to a good chain joint  watch out. The gloves ,the sweeping, the prep area the bathroom omgosh  the bathroom  and the eating area. If I could give this place  half a star like I did at Wendy's  in Clover,  gross.
