MpKFIa0lIaOKSuP6SuDNOA Landed at PHX and went to Taco and Dilla before checking into our hotel. It was a great choice. Our family (5 and 7 year old girls) shared a cheese quesadilla, blue cheese quesadilla (omg delicious), chips and salsa and the Thai quesadilla. All amazing. Topped off with friendly and helpful service. It was an awesome trip! The server even gave us some churros to try. Obviously they were amazing to.
