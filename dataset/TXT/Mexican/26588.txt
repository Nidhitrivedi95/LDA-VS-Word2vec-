3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ Great ambience, neat architectural features and good LOOKING food in this place but that's about it. I love tacos and really wanted to love this place, but the flavors were non existent for me. I had the Al Pastor pork, Guild Chicken, and Peking Duck tacos and didn't like a one. Even the street corn was over cooked. I will say my girlfriend did enjoy her tacos but this place is not for me.
