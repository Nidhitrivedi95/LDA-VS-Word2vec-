4h8HCTd5h-oEH9XtkX82GQ My boyfriend and I are Ruby regulars. At 7:30pm they pull into their spot at the car wash on Thunderbird just west of the 101 and you can expect them to be there for you until about 11:30pm-midnight. We crave their tacos throughout the week and have them for dinner at least once if not twice a week. Can you blame us? They're delicious and the price is amazing, $1.50/taco. We get 3 tacos each, chips with pico de gallo and guac and have our filling, amazing, best tacos ever dinner for $10. When it's not freezing we usually eat there at the food truck tables, but in the winter we call in our order and just pick it up and go. Ruby and his daughter are the nicest people to work the truck and I've never been disappointed with anything on their menu. Even though I usually stick to tacos, it doesn't hurt to add on a perfect churro or switch it up to a quesadilla or burrito. Yum all the way!
