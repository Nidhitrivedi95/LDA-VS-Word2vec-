nUfeYJ_YEaDzggPKnYry3g Wow I am shocked by how good the reviews are for this place. My family and I came here because of the reviews and we were disappointed. All of the salsa was sweet, which is ok but just different. The service was okay until we told the server about the pork being extremely dry, inedible and he said that's how pork is. No offer to fix it or ask if my husband wanted something else. The red sauce has a kick which I liked but for my sons cheese enchilada it was way too spicy for a young child. It would have been nice for the server to forewarn, but my fault since I didn't ask. Food was fast and hot, but very mediocre and the steak in the enchiladas and pork in the carnitas was very dry and lacking in flavor. Beers are overpriced for the small glass, sodas are large. No manager was to be seen. Ordered taquitos for my other son which were made with flour not corn tortillas and they were extremely overcooked and inedible as well. The server offered to do nothing to correct that either and we asked for a manager and one never arrived. We love Mexican food, but this is one place we will never return to again.
