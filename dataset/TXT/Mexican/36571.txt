5KheTjYPu1HcQzQFtm4_vw Food...it's not the best Mexican in the world but it's pretty good. The portions are generous and everything seems tasty in a good way. Skip the steak fajitas and order a ground beef chimi instead. Kids meals are generous and they always seem pleased. Bean dip w/ salsa is quite good.

Ambiance....it's ok. Nothing to write home but always clean and cool. It can get a little crowded on the weekend.

Staff...for the most part friendly. The manager can get a little too talkative.

Verdict....for the price it's quite good. Definitely worth a try.
