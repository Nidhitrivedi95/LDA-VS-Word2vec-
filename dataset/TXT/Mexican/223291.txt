RUxAdd3mmNkejoTAX2YIDw I was in tampa florida getting fish tacos at a place that was on DDD.  They were amazing to say the least.  
  AMAZING
We also ordered steak burritos..wanted it medium rare..
came back well done.
My son's friend said Patron's have great fish tacos.  Wow was he mistaken.  What I
perceived to be a fish taco appeared to be fried mash potatoes on a tortilla..
No exaggeration either...a few accompaniments on the side.  They were a total
disaster.  I just sucked it up.  My wife got a steak burrito...meat like shoe leather.
Honestly, there is not one Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh that can cook a decent piece of steak for a fajita , taco or burrito.  It is the ruination of meat.  If you like shoe leather meat, go to a Mexican restaurant.

Those items there do not impress.  The food overall here is average at best.
It's more like cafeteria food./
