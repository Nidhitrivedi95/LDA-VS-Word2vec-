B9To2QK1qbHKGSMDh6IrjA We were on a long road trip and I was glad to find a place that served very good homemade Mexican food.  Good people, good food and clean restrooms and a place to fill up along the way.  I was lucky enough to find this tiny restaurant while heading north and then I found them again on my way back home.
