SW6ZQk22G1_CV81_gfnvNQ Went here with a few of my girlfriends on a Friday night. Of course the wait was 1.5 hours but we were able to snag a spot at the bar and order a pitcher of margarita (definitely not the best I've had) and order some chips and guac. The guacamole is really good.
We ended up being seated at a nice booth in the back. It's super loud in there, so be prepared to scream to hear one another.
We each ordered 4 tacos - a bit much as I couldn't finish my 4th one.  I ordered the cod which two of us agreed was the best. My friend thought the oxtail was the best (special of the night). I did not like the beef cheek as I thought the beef had a weird flavour. I liked the fried cheese one, but felt the beans overpowered the saltiness of the cheese so made it kind of bland.
The churros I thought were great, especially because of the caramel sauce that comes with it.

Super glad I finally got to check this place out as it's been on my list for a while. But I don't think it's worth a 1.5 hour wait (maybe try a week night if you're going to go) and I probably won't be back.
