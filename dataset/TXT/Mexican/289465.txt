YkOCo5ipV2he2WXIAlZb-A The restaurant is set up like a Chipotle. But I was told to stick with the pre-made menu otherwise the flavors would be off. This was my first visit and I did as directed. The staff was very helpful!!!  I  had the Kodiak and it was very good. The sauces that were on the burrito were blended perfectly. The fresh veggies were refreshing. I put it on a tortilla as suggested because the salmon on my burrito wasn't raw and the seaweed wrap is better for raw fish. Very helpful to know this for future visits.  For a couple bucks more, you get a drink and side. The burrito was perfect and the right price. Not sure I had salmon on my burrito but the fish tasted fine. I will go back.
