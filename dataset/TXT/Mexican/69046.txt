bQ2uuNkOxgUQRM7Y7RJDXQ Excellent food!  Live music on weekend.  The restaurant is quaint and tables are close together which can be loud. I would like to visit the restaurant and eat outside next time. We went on a very hot day which made outdoor eating not possible. It is a little pricey compared to other Mexican restaurants.
