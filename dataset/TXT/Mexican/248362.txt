u8CFMZ9rCMDvKGDyqt6MEQ We have been a couple of times and food is good.  We visited on 5/5/2016 and when my daughter ordered she clearly stated no beans and rice in her burrito.  Our food came out and there were beans and rice in her burrito, when we brought it to the servers attention and asked for a new order she said ok and then came back and told us because of how busy they were they couldnt make her a new order. I have never been to eat somewhere where that was the reply.  Very disappointed and will not be returning.
