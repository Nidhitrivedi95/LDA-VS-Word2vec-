XxXmyN3tlroRQ1SOoSXHAA Been coming here for years, and it's always just as good as the first time I came. A little hole-in-the-wallish, but that's part of it's charm. It's fine, no-frills delicious Mexican, with excellent chips and home-made hot sauce. Just about every item on the menu is a winner.
