VuYF1vGKLjEFaQfL4Ypwqg I walked in and was pleasantly excited but also confused. The texture of the space seemed really cool. There is a separate bar area and a walk up ordering area. Good mix of tables but the two tops seemed a bit small. A little peeved when we walked in because the menu said HH was available, but the staff said it was not. I get that it's still a new place. A sign would be nice.
Food was as good as I remembered. I ordered the elote ($7 a little steep). Really flavorful. I also ordered three tacos ($3.25 EA): Al pastor (my fave- great flavors), carne (ehhhh- ok flavor and chewy), and del Mar (good). I also ordered a chelada to wash it down.  
Bathrooms were very cool. Modern and hip.  The patio area will be awesome when it gets cooler. 
I will be back! Welcome back Gallo Blanco! We've missed you.
