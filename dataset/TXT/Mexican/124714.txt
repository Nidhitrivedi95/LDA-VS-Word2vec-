HQObn6hrV9WoeFObGfa2YQ Yummy!!! Finally found a street taco place close to my house that is decent. They have good toppings, nice salsa selections. It's setup is similar to chipotle where you order and pick what you like added. They fry up the asada meat on the grill in front as you pick your toppings.  My favourite meat so far is the carne asada. I recommended that they add horchata. Will definitely come back.
