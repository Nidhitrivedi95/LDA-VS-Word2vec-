4PqqRa7o_eNydKdGWYdIog We were traveling from Flagstaff to Tucson and stopped by TC Tacos for a halfway dinner stop.  It will now be a common stop when we are in Tempe.  Great service, positive feel, a delightful salsa bar, in-and-out, and the street tacos......mmmmm, fabulous, tasty, and super fresh.  A lot of pride has been put into this great little local restaurant.

See ya next time, TC Tacos!
