8KEB1lcjKlIVSd6uA8JB9w Very bad service here.  I usually don't bother with Yelp but it took my wife about 10 minutes to get cheese quesadilla after we were already seated and had paid. When she got it they tried giving it to some other person.  Gets one star because food was good.  Hire some competent people, 20 minutes to make a salad and a cheese quesadilla, c'mon.  It also was not packed in here.
