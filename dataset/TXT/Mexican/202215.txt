PndkxtLCDv69LBE5Ay8Mwg Freshly made chips. Delicious salsa... UNBELIEVABLE lunch specials ($5.99). And $1 tacos on Tuesdays. I enjoyed the enchiladas meal. The shredded beef was my favorite meat... Not the fastest, so maybe call ahead or plan on a good 45 minutes total for lunch. Not in Glendale too often but will for sure eat here again when I'm back in the neighborhood.
