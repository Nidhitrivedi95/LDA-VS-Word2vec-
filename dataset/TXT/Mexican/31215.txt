4I-DntICTD2ykxPN4NOJ4g I had the combo appetizer and it was the BEST.  Loved everything on it, falafel was crunchy and delish, eggplant dip was totally homemade tasting, dolmeh yummy, hummus was also really good.  I also tried my daughter's lentil soup and it was great as well.  Price was reasonable and my portion was large, had to share it.  Would definitely come back the next time I'm visiting Arizona.  If you want to eat super healthy this is the place!!!
