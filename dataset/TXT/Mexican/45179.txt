7mU3l5VjH1IxsXcxBxUblg Decided to try because of the great reviews. I ordered takeout and decided on the Arroz con Camarones (grilled shrimp with mixed veggies over rice). My meal was hot, excellent and came with nachos and salsa. The price is hard to beat ~$14.99 and the portion size is perfect. The shrimp were large (notch below jumbo compared to grocery store sizes) and well cooked without being overdone. Perfect plumpness. The one thing that could have been better is the spice level. There was none. A dash of hot sauce or more pepper would have been appreciated. I definitely will return and make this particular meal a go-to.
