_xiUV8OfR6yUJk-09QD6zA Maybe their fish or meat burritos are good, but the vegetarian burrito I ordered was the worst of bland Canadian faux-Mexican. 

The cook and other staff were really nice, though. So nice that I had to sneak 1/3rd of my remaining burrito in the trash when they weren't looking.
