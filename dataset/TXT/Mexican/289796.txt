ymyEH_7lZV1ytVsSUGcsag This place is spot on each time.  The whole family loves it. Usually hubby and I order the Chimi roll appetizers and split the moljacete. Food is consistently good each time, never had a bad meal there AND never had bad service. Food always comes out quick no matter how busy. No not 100 percent authentic but definitely not like Taco Bell as one reviewer claims. So much better. Also to clarify the reviewers claim that there is no queso in Mexico is absolutely false. Different regions have different dishes. Part of my family up here is from Mexico, and no they don't  do queso. But I have been all over Mexico and I can tell you that deep in the heart of Mexico, copper canyon region yes queso exists! I know because I ordered it in error before lol. Just because you think you know one region of Mexico doesn't mean you know all of it!! And because you lived in Cali, been to "New Mexico" does not mean you qualify as an expert on Mexican food...it just makes ya look silly saying theres no queso in Mex. Long story short...excellent food, excellent service, excellent price. We regret whenever we choose another restraunt over this one. Usually that decision is made because they do not have a patio. Can I give 10 stars?
