Though the location is cool, everything at the restaurant seems amateur. The tacos are so small for what they charge, as is the guacamole. One would think with tacos that tiny, the ticket times from the kitchen would be 5 minutes....try 95 minutes and they screwed up our order. 

Our server was polite and friendly, but was quickly overwhelmed by having tables spread out across the outdoor dining area. We asked for our guacamole 4 times before it showed up, and got frustrated after 45 minutes without our order. Our table didn't eat at the same time, and upon trying to discuss the issues with our server, she couldn't control the tears and disappeared for awhile. (mind you: a Wednesday night, no sporting events, just nice weather in Cleveland to bring out the customers.)

Once one of our party located a manager to address what was going on -- and to me this is the most disgusting part of the entire experience - - the manager threw our server under the bus blaming her for ticket mistakes, wrong table numbers, etc. Be a manager! Protect your team! Solve the problems and deal with the staff later. 

Oh, and the food we waited so long for - the micro tacos - they had no flavor. 

Barrio for life.
