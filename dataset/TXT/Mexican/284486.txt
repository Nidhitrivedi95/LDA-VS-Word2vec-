Flies all over the dining room. Ripped up upholstery. Big divots in the floor where  structural elements were removed and never patched.

Now the food.  I ordered the ground beef taco. The meat had absolutely no seasoning and was oily. The fry bread was not fully cooked and oily. The scant bit of lettuce that was put on the taco was wilted and brown. And the salsa the counter attendant raved about we couldn't try because the ketchup type bottle they put it in was sealed shut with gunk.

2 bites in and we left. Waste of money and now I have a stomach ache.
