BToSTEiaK94G3h5_XROEcA We went here last night. This place was unexpectedly great!!! It was a cute little Mexican restaurant. If you like spicy, ask them for their spicy sauces to go with the chips and salsa it was pretty delicious. We went on a Friday night and there was a mariachi band which was super cool. They walked around and serenaded the tables and asked for requests. The food was pretty good. The taco was delicious. The only reason I gave them one less starves cause I got an enchilada and it didn't have any cheese in it, and usually every other enchilada I've had has had cheese so it tasted a little funny. We will def be going back though it wasa great little Mexican place.
