Yewxcf5-kbESoS5r1l-1AQ The tacos at this place are flavourful and the service is friendly. I can see that there are a few people here who are criticizing the price point and portion size but it worked well for me (and trust me when it comes to tacos I start to really identify with the "bet you can't have just one" mentality). I walked by and got 1 taco for 6 dollars with fries piled on top and it filled me right up on a hot summer day. The salsa is delicious and the menu is sparse because NEWSFLASH it's much easier and better to concentrate on making small delicious menu than to have a lot of choice but sacrifice quality.

I've brought several of my friends since and they have all exclaimed that it is the best taco they've ever had in the city. I don't know if I can say that (because of childhood allegiances - I think I may have a blood oath with another place), but it's the best one that I've had in St Henry and very high on the list!
