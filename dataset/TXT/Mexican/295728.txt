ZCe93zAkxr2KOBU1NT0lmg I first came here in the mid 80's, and pretty much was a regular for about 20 years. We moved farther north so we stopped coming for a number of years (and our kids were younger then and not fans of any mexican food). 
Went back recently, this place is still awesome! Service is excellent, and I cannot ever recall ordering something that wasn't incredible.
Chips are perfect, margaritas delicious, has a friendly neighborhood feeling. Not fancy, and shows its age some, but still cannot be beat for great mexican food!
Party platters are a great deal as well for take home parties and work luncheons.
