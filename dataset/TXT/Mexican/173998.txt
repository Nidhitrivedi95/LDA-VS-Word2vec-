mkD_-SGitlVrOcF1nnSfXA Z-Teca isn't amazing, but it's definitely as not terrible as these reviews make it sound.  (Although, I've never found the muck served at Burrito Boyz to be that enjoyable).  I had a vegetarian burrito on whole wheat. As far as vegetarian burritos go, it's probably one of the best I've had. They use black beans and roasted corn or roasted fajita vegetables. I asked for just a little bit of rice, guacamole, lettuce and salsa (Mango and Mild). It was quite refreshing and flavourful. They also have vegetarian quesadillas, salads or bowls.  I recommend mixing the salsas for extra flavour. The inside of the restaurant is also quite nice. There are a lot of big tables and booths, nice art work, big windows overlooking Gerard/Ryerson.
