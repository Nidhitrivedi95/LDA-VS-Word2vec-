Our party of 3 opted for a tortilla chip-heavy journey and ordered both the guacamole and Trash Can Nachos with chicken as well as our free chips and salsa. I'm sad to say we did not finish the Trash Can, so I guess we were more of a Trash Cannot. We also split an order of chicken chimichangas that we couldn't finish either. Not great, but not bad. Then we opted for the Tres Leches Bread Pudding. We came closer to to polishing this off, but failed. Thus it will not surprise anyone that my dining mate could not finish her frozen virgin strawberry daiquiri. Our trip to Flavortown was long and winding but perhaps a bit too much for us.
