geQG2a9uO6Q9hXVx937Kbw It's a Burrito Boyz. Never bad when its 2am in the morning and you are feeling like a big burrito. Check in to yelp to get the free chips and salsa. They were nice about that!

It was pretty much only a take out restaurant for this location. No seating. 

Always say yes to guac.
