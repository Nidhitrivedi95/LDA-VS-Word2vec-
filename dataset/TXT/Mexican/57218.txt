El Catrin is a hidden gem in Toronto overshadowed by other attractions at the distillery. The vibe is fantastic and the patio is beyond words. A fully heated outdoor patio that welcomes sub zero temperature. 

Limited draft selection but for Agave lovers, the tequila menu covered top down on the menu. My friend and I went for drinks but ordered chicken burrito as a snack. 

It was pretty darn good.
