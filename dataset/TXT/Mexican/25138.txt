Small restaurant, with a small menu, super casual, has a fast food feel to it; the few items they have in the menu, they definitely do them right.

I went for the first time yesterday, on a weekday during my lunch hour, decided to get their "campechano" tacos in a combo, which is half fish + half shrimp...2 tacos, a drink, and fries; figured it was a decent meal.

SURPRISE!! Tacos are HUGE and meaty, I couldn't even finish them! They serve you the tortilla w/ the meat, and they have a salsa/veggie bar for you to prepare them w/ the toppings you want. Shrimp tasted FRESH! They don't cook the tacos until you order them. The salsa bar has a great combination of true Mexican and white washed salsas, very great combination! Cabbage, pickled onions, jalapenos, salsa, chipotle cream sauce, very nice variety. Their Ranch does not taste like ranch, it's more like a seasoned garlic cream sauce that tastes amazing! The fries are seasoned fries, cooked to perfection!

The service was great, friendly staff, everything super clean, quickly done order, very satisfied.

I am a fan, and I will definitely ill be going back.
