tCkd8eAx2mR0oioQcqkxPw Great place. Simple menu, but I find that's the hallmark of really good food. Husband had the al pastor torta and I had the green chili pork burrito. Both were superb. 

Also appreciate the helpful staff who assisted me in navigating food allergy needs. 

Will definitely be back!
