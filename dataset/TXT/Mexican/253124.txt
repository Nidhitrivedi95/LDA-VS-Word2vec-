UXkD2CbW8BnTpYyUTsrCTQ Well, Del Taco is a piece of work - their tacos and taco-salads are incredible. I always enjoy their jack quesidilla and chicken taco but now they have this beef taco salad which is amazing.

They have a really fresh, quality product that is amazing. They hire nothing but mexicans but I guess that's how they insure the quality mexican food =)
