iZfeH70e_YFLrURT8WuCYQ I'm currently obsessed with their veggie fajitas. 
The sangria I ordered wasn't half bad. 
The salsa is very good!
 
The menu has variety. You can get the typical mexican combinations or venture into the specials or vegetarian part of the menu. All are executed well. The fish tacos were okay and my husband thought the beef tacos were good. 

Everything in the restaurant is brightly colored. The tables, the walls, the chairs are pink, green, blue. I can only imagine how much money went into decorating the place.  But the prices are still good. Not dirt cheap but nothing fancy.

Kids 10 and under eat free on Sunday.
