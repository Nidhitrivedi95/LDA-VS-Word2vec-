FI7RsrAxVdiDEuSKlYql1w This is the best Mexican place I've visited. It's out of the way for me, but the staff, food, and margaritas make it worth the trip.  

I attend their Taco Tuesdays at least a majority of the year. It's a great deal.  They offer an assortment of different proteins for their $1.25 tacos and there's a bar full of toppings to make your perfect taco. Couple that with buy one get one half off margaritas and Tuesday is the best night here in my opinion. The long line of people shows that others agree. 

The menu doesn't end just at their tacos though. They offer a different meal each day of the week at a special price and it's a good way to find a new food to sample.  They do the classics great as well and I'm often getting their grande quesadilla which lasts me two meals. 

This is a very family-friendly restaurant and the staff makes you feel like family too. You'll probably hear at least one table being sung "Happy Birthday" by the workers. On top of that, the owner is normally working behind the bar and gets to know many of the customers. If you're lucky, he'll maybe even share a shot with you. Always a great time here at Fiesta.
