_Kd0kQ8RF70hJ1ykLqCRyQ I was surprised that my visit went so poorly. I usually attend the one on Stephanie because I work in that area but one night I decided to change things up and grab food on the way home.

Started off by ordering a kids quesadilla (usually free) then ordered my food. Got to the part of the line where you ordered queso and well they were out? Then I asked for an 8 ounce Fresca and a bag of chips. They had Fresca but didn't have any chips? When I got to the counter to check out the girl working the register yelled back and asked, "are we out of chips?" The person that served me yelled "yes" and the person in the back yelled "no." At the same time. : )

Turns out they had chips. Still no queso. The person serving me had asked the girl at the register to not charge me for the Fresca and chips since they were out of queso. I guess it was supposed to be a nice gesture to make things right.

I didn't pay attention to the final cost just handed over my debit card. I guess what threw me off was the girl sniffing my food and telling me my food smelled like McDonalds.

Total bill was over $21.00

My food 
Kids quesadilla $5.99
Pint of Fresca not 8 ounces I learned $5.99

Man. This hurt my Cafe Rio morale.
