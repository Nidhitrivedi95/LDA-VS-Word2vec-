G6BwYw_0_atLPTzI1uokIA Went here the other day With my boyfriend for lunch. It was good!! I had grilled fish tacos. It came with rice and beans. Great in flavor and huge portion. My boyfriend got the buffalo ranch nachos. He completely demolished it!! Waitress was friendly and kept an eye out on drinks and if we were enjoy ourselves. Even the manger checked up on us as well as other customers dining in. I guess my only complaint is that I bit into my taco and the avocado still had its shell on it. Good to know it was fresh but a surprise to chew into that. Other than that it was a pretty great experience and A+ in customer service!!!
