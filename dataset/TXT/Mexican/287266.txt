YcGHCoSkl2PLKsHQCiu0HA I checked this place out on yelp because the business had a rating of 4 1/2 stars on a Tuesday for $1 chicken tacos. There honestly isn't a difference between this place and the other competitors Don Tortaco and Robertos. My boyfriend didn't like the food at all. I thought it was just okay. I won't be returning.
