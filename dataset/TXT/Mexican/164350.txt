lIFjn05i1kYq4q5cDKURBw I was surprised at the service I received from this location on Monday, 05/04/15.  I've gone there quite a few times over the past year, as this is the closest location to where I live.  And, honestly, this is the first time that the service was this bad.  I knew it was going to be a bad experience from the moment I placed my order at the drive thru.  First off, the female taking my order was talking to her co-workers right in the middle of taking my order.  When I got up to the window, she was still talking to them, and only turn for a split second to say the amount: "$11.47, what kind of sauce??".  No, "Hi, how are you", no confirming what I ordered...NOTHING.  Then, when she handed me my order...she didn't even turn to look at me...still talking to her co-worker, she stuck her arm out the window, not even looking in my direction.  She didn't say thank you or anything.  And, if that wasn't bad enough, he arm wasn't even far enough out of the window for me to comfortably grab the bag without unlatching my seat belt!!  Then, I get home and discover the churros that I ordered had little to no cinnamon or sugar on them, I ordered extra cheese (which I was charged for) and they neglected to add that as well.  Then to top it off, I asked for mild sauce and was given inferno.  Yeah, probably the worst experience I've had with a fast food restaurant in a very long time.
