Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ As a frequent traveler, I get to dine in many different cities  and restaurants. On a recent trip to Las Vegas, the restaurant was recommended but turned into the worst experience I have ever had. While the server was great, the food was delayed for over 30 mins and came out wrong then when it was sent back it took another 30 mins and came out wrong again. Upon discussing this with the person we thought was the manager, we quickly found out he was not in charge. When we asked to speak to the manager, we were told he was not willing to come to our table to discuss the events. This was the worst of all responses. We never got our meal and left with a horrible experience. This will be the last time we stay or go to an MGM property or restaurant.
