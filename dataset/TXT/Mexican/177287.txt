ms7cmWkPiSBDTnz-1sv2kQ Searching for a 'not 'packed' place on a Friday night around 9pm... FOUND IT.  Staff were friendly- Sat at the bar... had the coconut rice and the grilled peach salad- really tasty.  A bit dark inside- would like to sit on their patio next time, but it was too cold.  We will definitely go back.  Support this local business!!!!!
