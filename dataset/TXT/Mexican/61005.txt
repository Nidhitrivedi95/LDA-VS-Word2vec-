arpBUwgiaE8iqfNGMQ_hgg I'll start by mentioning that I love my burritos and am a huge fan of Burrito Boyz and was told by a few people that this burrito was just as good if not better. 
Well I was lied to, I was very disappointed with the burrito. The meat tasted like they used a sloppy joe mix pack to flavor the meat and when I bit into it it was all cold. 
Needless to say, I'll be sticking with Burrito Boyz for my burrito fix
