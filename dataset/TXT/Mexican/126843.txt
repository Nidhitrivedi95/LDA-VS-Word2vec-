hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg Just a note about the reservation issue I had, opentable is garbage when it comes to this restaurant.  Its a 30 day lead time to make the reservation.  I checked open table 8am Eastern exactly 30 days before my intended reservation and they said no tables available.  I even tried this at 12:01am and got the same result.  To get a table, call.  Pay the international toll from the US to Canada and call.  I even left a message around 1:45pm 30 days before my reservation date and they called back around 2:30pm.   

I will follow up at the end of July when we actually visit.  

(FYI, I usually love opentable, I've collected my share of $25 checks from them with all the reservations I made on the site.  But for Garde Manger...not so much)
