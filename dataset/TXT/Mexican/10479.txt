_XN-GwzZwAyIqLKJsl2htg At the restaurant I thought the service was poor. There was multiple mistakes and we were served the wrong thing multiple times. We were also served the wrong dishes of fried rice which we decided to eat but, they were different than what waiter told us they were. The tacos were also dry and lacked a lot of flavor. The dessert were not very good either. The tres leches cake was more of a pound cake then a typical tres leches. The best part of the restaurant was the fried rice. That was truly very good with a sophisticated range of flavors.
