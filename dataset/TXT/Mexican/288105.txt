Yevhl8bTwdJuu_LWKv-4Fw Yes.  If you like meat and latin flavors, without spending a ton of cash, yet getting an ENORMOUS plate of food, this is the place to eat.  Went with a large group and all of our dishes were meaty to the max, and all of us struggled to finish.  But! we did, because it was cold out, and this is some great comfort food.

I started with a ceviche, which was great with the plantain chips.  For my meal I had the lamb stew which actually had a decent amount of lamb in it.  Also got what I believe was the house margarita and oh my did that go down fast.
One friend had the steak that came with the yuca fries.  While the steak was gone quickly, I was allowed to try a yuca fry and I've now got to find out where the @#$% I can get a yuca and make fries myself!  The most popular dish at the table was the pork cubano and I can see why -- the meat fell apart in your mouth (that doesn't look right now that I've typed it out.  In fact it looks creepy.  But it's true!  It was delicious!)

Oh, and if you're into rum, the drink menu looked good.  But as I said above, so were the margaritas... I'm more of a tequila girl myself.  ;)
