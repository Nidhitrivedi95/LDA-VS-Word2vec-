SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA We are always searching for great Mexican food, with our favorites being Javier's and Sol Agave, both in Orange County. Move over guys, as I discovered Juan's Flaming Fajitas on a recent Vegas getaway. This place is the best! Great food and prices also extremely reasonable, but it's about 6 miles off the strip. This is my new go to spot when in Sin City, try it you will not be disappointed.
