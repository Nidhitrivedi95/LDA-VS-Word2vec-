woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ The food here is awesome! Went for my BF's birthday and couldn't have had a better experience. Our server Chris was awesome and very knowledgeable about the drinks and menu. We started with the ceviche which was great. We ordered the Chorizo, Baja, Steak, and Carnitas tacos. All were awesome and so flavorful but my favorite is the Baja, since I'm a Cali girl I love my fish! It's also the one with the least amount of spice. They brought out a Tres Laches Cake with a candle since it was my BF's birthday and that was really good as well. Definitely going to become one of our staple restaurants when we're downtown. Also the drinks were strong and good, try the Thai Coconut drink if you want something really tasty and different!
