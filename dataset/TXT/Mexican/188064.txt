Comparing it to a similarly priced modern/fusion burrito/taco place (like Chipotle), I would definitely say the the flavors pack more of a punch and they're all definitely more distinct.  I'm still not to the point of "Yay, I'm a fan," as the 4-star rating would suggest, but I definitely think that it's strong competitor on campus.

As for the change in opinion, the Gogi bowl had a better proportioning of ingredients and the taco had more meat (always a good thing!).  I was still disappointed that I was given a plastic to-go box even after being asked if I was getting it "for here or to-go."  I know that they have and could clearly see the wooden bowls used for eating in sitting in the kitchen.

The kitchen is still half empty and the customer service is... complacent at best.  They should've taken over the restaurant labeled as "Pitaya" on Green street for a better aesthetic and flow.  I have a feeling they'll never hit over 60% capacity unless something big changes.

I really wish I could give them 3.5 stars, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt due to my (as my friends say) "scathing" review the first time.
