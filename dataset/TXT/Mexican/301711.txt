zVyi1UCU8XPcULQEzioE_g Stopped in here a few days after they first opened.  I went to get a take out burrito and for some reason waited for nearly 20 minutes before being served despite there being only 3 or 4 people ahead of me in line.  Nothing looked overly fresh or appetizing but loving burritos I decided to try it anyways.  I asked if the refried beans were vegetarian (authentic mexican beans often have lard in them) and was told simply "They're just beans."  That doesn't answer my question.  I wanted to know exactly whats in them.  Guaranteed there's some sort of seasoning or oil or something in them and it shouldn't be that hard to tell me whats in them.  When I further pursued, a man who was presumably the owner came out and gave me a bunch of attitude because he didn't know what was in them.  For the portion size, the food was overpriced and just as it looked, it was bland, dry, not fresh and not flavourful.  I'm more than certain that all of the "testimonials" on their website and the rave reviews on Urbanspoon are fakes submitted by the staff.  I also should note that there is nothing authentic mexican about this place.  The restaurant decor looked similar to a Wild Wings.  Nothing special.  Overall I was highly unimpressed by this place.  I may give it one more chance considering that they were brand new when I was there.  Hopefully they have improved.
