k-drEjxKmfqllwfY90STfA Cantina 1511 has been a staple restaurant for my wife and I since moving to Charlotte 6 years ago.  It was recommended to us when we first moved here, and we have since recommended it to others.  The food and service are always excellent.  I love getting 2 Marco Polo tacos with their delicious side salad.  Another favorite is the Carnitas (Mexican barbequed pork).  Obviously, with so many positive reviews, you know their doing things right.
