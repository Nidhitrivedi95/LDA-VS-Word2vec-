nM9NwHXy3EadihjJTG2i5w Look no further for your taco Tuesday fix. I'd recommend the fried potato rolled taco combo plate ($8.99). It comes with 3 potato tacos and a side of rice and beans. Everything tasted great - I had zero complaints. No meal would be complete at a taco shop without some horchata. As far as I know, Pancho's Tacos is the only place in town with vegan horchata. I've also tried the Gran Torta ($9.99), which is not to fuck with. Seriously, it's loaded up with chorizo, ham, cheese, and who knows what else. Just eat it.

Oh yeah, did I forget to mention the menu is 100% vegan? Pancho's is a vegan hotspot, but on the two times that I've been here omnis have waltzed in with no idea this place was even a vegan restaurant. Notably, they stayed to try out the food so kudos to Pancho's for exposing the masses to good Mexican vegan food. 
 
INSIDER TIP: Word on the street is that the owner of this lovely taco shop was a professional soccer player!
