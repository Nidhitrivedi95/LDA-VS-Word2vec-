g9vzFlunYXagaH5hNkU2Uw Food was tasty and well prepared, and the menu was very diverse. However, the waiter forgot to ring in my meal, and the food was delivered by the owner. I figured mine was on the way, but it never came even after our waiter came to refill my son's water without a glance at me or anyone else. Ten plus minutes later, the owner stopped by to ask how our meals were and I mentioned I hadn't received my food. A meal was quickly delivered but everyone else was already finished. We were never even asked if we wanted dessert or another drink but a ticket was dropped on our table, with no discount/comp on my forgotten meal. 

Its a shame as this was my first and probably last meal there despite decent food.  We were clearly just another ticket to the waiter, as we just slipped out the door, unacknowledged.
