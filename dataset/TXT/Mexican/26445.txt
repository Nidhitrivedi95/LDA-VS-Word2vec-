3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ Good food, good choice of tequila, fun atmosphere, but it is noisy as heck. I mean at times its just down right loud and you really cannot expect to have a conversation across the table. Its inside an old church and given that they kept the interiors as is to a very large extent I do not think the acoustics do not lend itself to playing R'n'B or techno or anything at that volume that the music is currently played at least. 

Now that I am done complaining about what is wrong, what is good is the drinks. The selection of tequila is extensive enough to keep me from complaining and that takes a lot. The service is fast and the bartenders are fun and great to talk to and do not rush you when eating at the bar. The tacos are good, but not necessarily make me want to go back right now kinda great. The chips and salsa is also pretty legit and happy hour prices are well the kind that make you happy.  Regular prices are I believe about a 150% more (2 vs 5$) and I have pretty much never been here at any other time, so take the taco pricing at face value.
