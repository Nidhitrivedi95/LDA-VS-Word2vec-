3IwCop28R1_L5jMv6AkL8Q My brother and I are foodies. Always trying new places. 

We decided to come check it out as it has a good rating.

It was our first time here today, February 15, 2017. 

Pros:
Prices are very affordable.
Value Menu has good options. $7-$9

Regular menu is affordable $8+

Customer Service is nothing outstanding but it is good. 

Cons:
The reason it is 2 star:
Food is very bland. No taste whatsoever. 
Very average. Full plate portions to fill you up? Yes. 
But to leave you cleaning the plate & happy belly? No. 

Honest review: Is it a restaurant we would consider coming back to? No.
