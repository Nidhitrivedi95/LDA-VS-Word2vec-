x7RRLRKyKdME9X3GuR5-5w I have been to this Macayo's a few times and every time it has been very disappointing. Today will be the last time I visit this restaurant. 

The service here is always slow and their attentiveness to the customer is non-existent. 

Today I had to send my margarita back two times because it was horrible and nothing more than crushed ice. The cheese crisp came out (after a 30 minute wait) over cooked and tasting like cardboard. 

I am being generous by giving them one star.
