DMwU0igEs9K7XuI3utsr6g I got the chicken chimichanga. It was the best iv ever ate. Really a whole knew flavor. It was amazing. The beans were very strong and the rice was very bland. I couldn't eat either of them. I got a margarita which was very good and a lot of it. The waitress was very fast and kept checking on us but got a little attitude at one point. She could have just been having a bad day. It happens. I would try it if you want a different take on a chimichanga.
