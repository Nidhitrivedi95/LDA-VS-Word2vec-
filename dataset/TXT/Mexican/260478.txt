vQq_sX0kSAUdT3yLW06q5A Reasons to Avoid:
-GLASS IN FOOD
-POOR SERVICE
-NEARLY NO ONE IN THE RESTAURANT ON A TUESDAY WAITED 49 MINUTES 
-COLD FOOD 


I came here with a group of five. We showed up for lunch at noon. There were four other customers total besides us at the restaurant. 

We didn't get our food till 12:49pm. The waiter didn't say sorry or even try to offer an excuse for the delay. 

One of the people I was with found a piece of glass the size of his thumb in his food. The majority of the food was cold or skip the simple request given of "no onions". 

I strongly suggest skipping this place. Between the waiter not really caring about the customer experience and the glass. It's not worth the gamble.
