ehMxdQ9FfF4uOcGPKNWNOg We used Cafe Rio for an event at our office and everything was great. The order was ready right at the time we requested and the manager went over the order before we left to make sure everything was there. The food was really good, and everyone raved about the quality and taste. We ordered a Nacho Bar for 25 people and it was the perfect amount of food. Really recommend Cafe Rio for company catering, good organization of the order and high quality food provided. The only minor issue were the tongs they provided all broke. However, overall thanks for helping me make a great event for my team.
