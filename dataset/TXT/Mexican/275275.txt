XcOy_IMkPO9jGBox6mHT8w I can't believe I had never stopped in to eat here before.  I live down the street and drive by here daily.  This is the closest to authentic Mexican food I have ever eaten in the US.  The street tacos are only $1.51 and super tasty.  The real star is the ceviche.  It is fresh and the shrimp is cooked in the lime juice and not chewy like most Tex Mex places.  It is also very clean and the staff are friendly and helpful.
