MesBAxNk_M7ISbBmVDiiWQ I've been here twice now, tried 5 different taco meats and a handful of other stuff, and I have to say, everything I've tried was good.

Took a large party here, they were very accommodating. A friend got fried plantains topped with chorizo and that was excellent. I got three tacos, lengua, carne asada, and al pastor. Al pastor is usually my favorite kind of taco, but of the three it was my least favorite. Not enough to knock it down a star, though. The lengua was perfect. Just absolutely fantastic.

On a second trip, I just got three tacos to go. Barbacoa was excellent, as was the carnitas. Had to get another lengua.

Prices are reasonable, but not cheap, but this is Cleveland, not Bakersfield, so I don't expect to find Mexican food of this quality for less pretty much anywhere.

Absolutely refreshing to have a taste of home right around the block from me.
