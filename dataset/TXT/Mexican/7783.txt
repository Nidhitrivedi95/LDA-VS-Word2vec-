_OoQ31fIoy3dK96rP6vtFQ My wife and I were just driving around looking for a place to eat. We spotted Moreno's and the place was packed at 7pm on a Sat night (4/8/17). We found an outdoor table and was served immediately. Pleasant atmosphere, chips and salsa were brought out right away. My wife ordered the street tacos and I had a Tejano burro with carne asada. She liked the tacos and the burro was warm and spicy (just right). I boxed half for a later meal. Good service. I recommend this location. Definitely will come back.
