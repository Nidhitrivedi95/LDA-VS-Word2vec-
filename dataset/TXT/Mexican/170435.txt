m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw Pancho's is a great option for Mexican fare in the Downtown Summerlin area near Nordstrom Rack and Trader Joe's. After receiving a coupon in the mail for a BOGO entree, we decided to try it out and are happy we did.

First, the restaurant looks like a house and the main dining room has a courtyard feel. It is open and full of fake plants and trees (it's a bit much). Our server was polite and the server assistant also quickly came with their chips and salsa. Pancho's salsa was excellent with a nice kick and their chips were good as well. I ordered the wahoo fish tacos and my partner got a very large burrito of some kind. My tacos were also excellent and he said the burrito was great too! I did order a house margarita on the rocks and it was just ok. It was quite strong, not really that good, and was over $10! This was for their house margarita! To me, this is a bit overpriced, especially if the house margarita doesn't consist of premium ingredients.

All in all, we will definitely be back to Pancho's. My fish tacos were really quite good and I love a good salsa. I will definitely not order the house margarita and wish they would clean up all the clutter in the dining room as far as the fake plants and such. Again, the service was quite friendly and that will always being us back again and again.
