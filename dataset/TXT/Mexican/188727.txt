OA5Li3ySzhrbG_WvD_QGYA This is going to be bad. With my move to Tremont happening in December I have a feeling I am going to be stopping in here a lot! 

We headed up on a Friday night and tried to hit happy hour for $2 tacos but we did miss it. That doesn't get us down since normally they are $3 so still an awesome deal. 

This place isn't that large and on a Friday night it definitely was packed and even though he told us a 20 minute wait and it was more like 40, we still had a wonderful time. We ordered some drinks at the bar which were delicious and when we were finally sat we were ready to eat! 

The tacos here are SO good, like I am craving them good and want to go RIGHT NOW. I ordered 2, one of them being the stoner taco mmm mmm mmm! Def. get that, its amazing! 

At this price skip taco bell and come here! It's SO good.
