Wnq5to0-jXyh0-_jRZ6VOQ My daughter and I were visiting ASU and tried it hoping for the best, we were not disappointed!  I had the fish tacos and she had the wild mushroom enchiladas.  We both couldn't stop praising our meals, not to mention the cornbread that was the best we ever ate.  Service was excellent and atmosphere was great. We sat outside and enjoyed the great weather.  We will definitely be going back once she starts school there in the fall.  
The only complaint I would have is that when I ordered Jack on the rocks, it was the smallest pour I had ever received in a bar/restaurant. (very minor, prob. not worth mentioning)
