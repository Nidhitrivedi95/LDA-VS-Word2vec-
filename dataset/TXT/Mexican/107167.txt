fQclKmk5G2_g98cDNPvj0g I have only been here twice. What I love is how authentic the food is. Simple great lunch prices Mexican food done right if you want typical authentic this is a great option. Also I want to add I left my computer and they held on to it for me the waitress said she ran outside after me but we pulled away too quick.  I know they charge extra for extra chips and no refills with the lunch special but they have low prices that's the only way they can make enough to stay in business. I also particularly like that three people came over to check on us it shows that they care and have passion for what they do. If your like me and love Mexican food you are in for a treat.
