LnsAgGlvIPmc9eV_cMdU5w Came here upon invitation of my friend for his birthday dinner.  Because the restaurant was tiny, we shut the place down for the night with 20-something people in our party.  Happy to be there as the service was very good, the servers keeping up with the big crowd and I was in good company for the whole meal.  I haven't even started with how the food tasted good and this comes from someone who is not such a big fan of tacos.  I definitely enjoyed the warm nachos, tasty and fresh guacamole samplers and absolutely yummy stuffed poblano pepper tacos.  Definitely a good find!
