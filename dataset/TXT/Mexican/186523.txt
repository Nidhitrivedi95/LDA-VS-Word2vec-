NYTe202AJmEynCj4STfRow Things have gone wrong since they moved locations. I ordered the chicken mole platter with rice and I had about two bites and quit. I don't know if it was just an off day, but the first bite that I had was cold and the second was all tendon. I don't know about you, but when I bite into tendon, it sets me teeth on edge and I can't eat anything else. I attempted to eat the rice but after a bite I quit as well. It tasted like it was out of a box. The mole sauce itself was nothing but spice. No flavor at all. Needless to say, I won't be back to this location.
