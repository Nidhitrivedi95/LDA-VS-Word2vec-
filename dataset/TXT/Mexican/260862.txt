VRwT0pscR5vESCrAnUpNwQ Since Valdez was full with a 30min wait, came to this joint a couple of wks ago on a Sat. We actually weren't sure if it was even open yet to the public since the brown papers still covered the glass walls. But, we pulled opened the door anyway and tried. There weren't too many ppl in the place yet so there wasn't a long wait. Service was lagging a bit but the staff was still in training, as taped on the front glass door.
But, they were great otherwise. No rudeness or attitude so far.
Will have to check back and see in a few months if things change. This place is a much trendier and hippier version of Chipotle but not like Chipotle, if that makes any sense.

Food was awesome. You love spicy and hot, you'll find the sauce in this place. They have quite a collection. Some of them are funny. I love love their chips - their nachos. I asked about it and was told it was freshly made there. I recommend the taquitos and corn. My appetite was satisfied on just those alone. 

Place is liquor licensed. They have a few selection of latin/SA beers like Tecate. They played old school and current rnb, hiphop from what I can remember. Vibe was good. 
Self-service at the time I went, not sure if this has changed since now that they are fully open and operational. Price is good considering it's on King St and in the midst of other exp restos and bars. Hopefully their prices don't change.

Great awesome new place on King. Will definitely be returning.
