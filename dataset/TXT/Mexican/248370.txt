u8CFMZ9rCMDvKGDyqt6MEQ Tried not to honor 3.5 month old gift certificate due to change in ownership. BS... you honor the gift certificate regardless of who owned the place when the GC was purchased. Only eventually took it because we made a scene and we're not scene making type people. The manager/owner also put the tip cash in the register. Unfortunate that they have the opportunity to operate a business in this wonderful country and they try to screw its people.
