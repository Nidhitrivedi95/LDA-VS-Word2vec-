qHseX2NHeUUedIgs_VasZA Most authentic Mexican food you can get in Pittsburgh. Great service and byob. I rarely complement the chef, but I had to with the nachos I had. The food is prepared with great attention to detail, If anyone is craving Mexican food... I always suggest this restaurant. I will be back soon!
