8USUyIeN39rurnqCn5cA0w We were looking for authentic and fresh Mexican food. We found it at Los Lupes. Everything was fresh and very tasty. The guacamole was spectacular and the steak tacos were very good. I had one of the best margaritas I have had in a long time. Loved that it was just off the very busy and crowded main strip. Highly recommend you try this gem of a restaurant! Ándale !
