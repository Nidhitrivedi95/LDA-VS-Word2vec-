URwrgfuyfpVqgnKwkawlHw I have been coming to this place since I was 13. My go to is the Rolandos breakfast burrito. You just simply can't beat it!!! Hands down best breakfast burrito in town! Their hours are very convenient and parking is very accessible. Everything else on their menu is amazing too. The staff is always friendly and the vibe is always relaxed and fun inside. Go get you a breakfast burrito.
