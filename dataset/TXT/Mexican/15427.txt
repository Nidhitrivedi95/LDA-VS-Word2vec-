Nonetheless, it is DELICIOUS! Good crust, too, but could use something to dip it in. First time in my life that I've had mango on pizza. Twas great. A little loud and definitely a family place, with about a dozen tables or so. Would definitely come back - and that's my first time saying that about a pizza place in Madison.
