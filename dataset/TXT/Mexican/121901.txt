havUcqU5tH0zorHxCxGj8A Old Pueblo Cafe is a cute little Mexican eatery tucked away in Litchfield Park.  I've been here a handful of times in the last couple of years and always leaving feeling alright (or a-ok in Yelpland) about my experience.

Like many other reviewers have mentioned, the fresh salsa and chips are a delight.  I love places that make really amazing pico de gallo and then also give you a fabulous tube (or ketchup bottle) of much hotter salsa to make your own perfectly spicy concoction.  I know- it is the small things in life.

When I was here on Wednesday, I ordered the spinach enchiladas with green sauce.  Not mind blowing, but decent.  The rice was great and being able to add the salsa to the mix also helped.  

Service is always pretty consistent, and they do have a happy hour (one dollar off of everything).  Margaritas seem to be hit or miss- I've had some great ones and some not so fabulous ones.  They have pitchers available of both margaritas and a couple of beers.

If you are staying at the Wigwam Resort, I'd recommend this place if you were really craving Mexican but I wouldn't go out of my way to check it out OR I'd suggest trying one of the other eateries on this little street of fun.
