tIauOelAC3BZk_xhMoDBUg The reason I am giving this place 4 stars is well I found absolutely nothing wrong with this place. The tables,floors,counter, kitchen area all clean. 
They have indoor and outdoor seating with a drive up window for phone and online orders. They had Mexican music playing in the background. If you were eating there they give you chips and salsa for the table and bring you your meal. The salsa was good and the breakfast burrito I had was great! All in all good place to get a burrito or Mexican meal. I will be going back.

The reason for the 4 stars also I only had one thing. It's hard to mess up a burrito. But I will be updating when I try something else.
