qoUo4VY2KpPmHbFVYcxGog I love Mexican food.  It reminds me of home (California) & it is comforting AND nourishing.

So, I was thrilled to hear about this place battling the typical Tex-Mex establishments that people usually recommend as Mexican cuisine.

This place is classy.  Classy & filling.  We ordered the vegetable enchiladas.  Delicious & filled with an assortment of veggies - not just the usual suspects.

& the churros?  Amazing.  The way to my heart is usually through cinnamon + sugar.

A little off the beaten path but totally worth it.
