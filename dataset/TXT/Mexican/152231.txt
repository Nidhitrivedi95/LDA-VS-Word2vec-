jxc3XS6v7J-_WHgYuaJ_cA I have mixed emotions about this one. The location is great. Our service was attentive and pleasant. But the food was only halfway there.  We started off with chips and guacamole which was about $8. The guacamole was delicious, but the chips - oddly - were the let down. I'm not that picky, but these were double-thick, hard as rock and tasted old and oily. My friend had the tortillia soup and sent it back - and she never sends anything back. However, i found both the shrimp and chicken tacos were delicious.  The shrimp tacos had giant tiger shrimp and the right mix of flavours.

I'd say they are worth a try for the tacos, but skip the chips and soup.
