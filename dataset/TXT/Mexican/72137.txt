c6lzPktduqtKqRSnX_CUTg Loved everything about this place...the Frida mural and influenced menu made it extra interesting.

Came in with large party and we tried a lot of things family style.. Octopus was stellar, very tender and was told it was marinated for 24 hours before cooking. Also loved the potstickers, gorgeous presentation and taste.  Fellow diners said the marrow and beef tacos were outstanding.  We tried all three soups and salads!  Wow!  Can't stop thinking about the gazpacho in particular.

Drinks & service fantastic!
