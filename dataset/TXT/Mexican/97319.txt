eJPckkV1k7gn0V2awA1pzA I am a big sushi fan, and I couldn't believe it when my sister shoved a sushi burrito in my face two years ago when I last visited family in Vegas. I cried every day since returning to the Northeast and its barren sushi burrito land.  Okay, not really, but I did have a food list of THINGS I MUST EAT RIGHT AWAY whenever I am back in Vegas, and this sushi burrito is in the top five...alright, top two. (If you must know, number one is reserved for Filipino food for this girl.)

I get the 3 Amigos, and it's just so dang tasty and fresh. I love that I can customize my order and tell them to hold the onions and gimme extra avocado. When I'm in town, we usually order via Yelp and pick up. This week though a friend and I actually decided to stay in and eat at the Badura location. Very well lit and clean location, friendly and fast service, gosh, it's just 5 stars all around. I rarely give 5 stars, but this place deserves it. Awesome food, awesome people, awesome place.  I just ate here an hour ago, and I'm already missing it and planning my next visit around this food item.
