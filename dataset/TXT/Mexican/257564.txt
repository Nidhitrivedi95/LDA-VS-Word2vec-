ViJGzET7fBMShhIgKew2Bg Without trying to sound too aggressive, I would like to say this is the best Mexican restaurant in Mississauga! I found out about this place while I was driving down Hurontario and Dundas and saw this in a small plaza. When I went there for the first time I was greeted by the owner who was very helpful in describing some of the menu items, he even taught my guest and I some words in Spanish! I ended up having the 'Wet Burrito" with Chicken which I found to be pretty good! You are able to pick different spice levels (1-5 I believe), I ended up going with 4 as the owner stated 5 is extremely hot (which it was as he gave me the sauce on the side). The Chicken wasn't overcooked and had a good texture to it which made it enjoyable to eat. The only issue I could say I found was the portions; and I feel this is an issue with all Mexican restaurants. I didn't seem to get full of my main order so I ended up going for dessert to fill myself up. For dessert I had the Churros which were pretty good and fresh tasting, I would skip the "dipping sauce" that is provided as it is way too sweet. All in all, it is a very good restaurant and I would definitely recommend checking it out!
