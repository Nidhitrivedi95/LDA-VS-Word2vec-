ZO3ihx5FOObI_uCgin4x8w My husband and i go here every couple of months. Service has always been really great. My favorite thing here is the queso! However the last couple of times we have gone the food was really dry and not very edible. I always order the same ultimate fajitas but each time i go back it gets worse and worse. Big bummer they took out the pacifico draft or I would at least come back for drinks and the atmosphere.
