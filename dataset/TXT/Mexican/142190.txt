jdaqp6fW0TqP2TdHatB7Pw First time visitors here. Ordered the salsa and chips, lime shrimp tacos and beef torta. For my taste the 3 salsas were interesting but I felt they needed a little pop to change good/interesting to great (my opinion). The shrimp tacos.. Heaven! Excellent shrimp not overcooked, fresh corn and slaw awesome texture and flavor! The beef torta beef was tender and also not overcooked. The beans and corn add the flavor brightness you need with mole'. Owner is very friendly and rightfully proud of his products! We will be back!
