1aYKH2ea5_dg0bLznqnvQA I hired lv taco for a party of 65 guests this weekend. I have to say my guests were extremely impressed!! They were on time and very helpful in setting up the table. Everyone was asking who made the tacos. I myself as the host was very happy . I will definitely use Peter the owner of LV tacos again for my next event. Peter the tacos were delicious!! Thank you so very much! You guys rock!!! Jaimi
