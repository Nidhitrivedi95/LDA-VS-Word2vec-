aqTdhZDTSjA42_Uh2E6V7A My first impression of Taco Loco was, admittedly, not great.  A bluesy sign on North Prospect advertising 99 cent tacos at a place with a silly name.  I imagined a place with all the quality of Taco Bell with all the atmosphere of Taco John's.  But don't be fooled, this is a real taqueria.

Tacos are served on soft corn tortillas with onion, cilantro, lettuce and tomato with your choice of meats.  The al pastor was spiced wonderfully, the lengua perfectly tender.  The ribeye steak was a nice cut, but frankly a little underseasoned.  To wash it down, glass bottles of Mexican Coke (mmm... cane sugar) or, of course, Jarritos.

Best of all - if you dread a trip north on Prospect, the menu says they'll be offering delivery soon.
