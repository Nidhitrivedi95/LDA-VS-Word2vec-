eem6eoAiYL9UcQUE0kMD-g I've eaten in expensive Mexican food restaurants all around the valley as well as hole in the wall places. And nothing compares to Adrian's. Hands down the best Mexican food and for the price. I come here all the time. Super small but has that authentic feeling to it. If your a sucker for a good breakfast burrito come here. Love this place and will continue to come here until I move.
