XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg We really enjoyed our brunch at Mesa Grill. We ordered the tuna tare tare nachos, tiger shrimp tamales and the shrimp tacos. 

The complimentary bread basket was really tasty, and a great way to start the meal! The tiger shrimp tamales were out of this world. I have never tasted a tamale anywhere near as good as this dish was- it was amazing! The tuna tare tare nachos and shrimp tamales were good, but nothing outstanding! Overall, we enjoyed our meal! Make sure you order the tamales.
