VO-p1uczeMbzH8bEAv-RgA This place smells like bug spray. I give it a F. The carpet needs to be removed. The resturant has a stinch smell when you first walk in.  My daughter and & I was their many years ago. And while we were eating our lunch. A cockroach was crawling on the wall next to us. We told the female waitress. And she told us to knock it to the floor and smash with our shoes. We will never ever go back their to eat. The food really isn't that good anways.
