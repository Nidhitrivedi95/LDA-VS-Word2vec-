gwd1W_0Mgzqo3QxgXrt16Q I swore I'd never go back but a friend wanted to go for her birthday so I got sucked into the group-thing. I tried to accept with a fresh frame of mind. 
I knew better than to order a Margarita this time as orange juice margs don't do it for me, so a simple glass of wine was fine. We ordered queso for the table. Tasteless and runny. 
No one raved about their dinners and lots went back when the table was cleared. I got a taco that I ate because I was quite hungry at the end of the workday, but anything would have done the trick. Please close this place so another better restaurant can take over this great patio space.
