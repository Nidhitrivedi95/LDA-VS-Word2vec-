9KeJfn7-6DFfUFoZLu_DNQ Had a great time at Escondite. My friend and I had not reserved, but we were lucky to get a place at the counter as soon as the place opened at 5:30 on a Saturday. The restaurant filled up quickly.

Beautiful interiors, very good service. My friend and I shared the corn bread, mango salad, baja tacos, la torta tacos (sp?). We had hibiscus yuze for drinks, and shared churros for dessert. It all came up to $23 each before tip. Not bad at all. Baja tacos were the best part. Definitely coming back for those.
