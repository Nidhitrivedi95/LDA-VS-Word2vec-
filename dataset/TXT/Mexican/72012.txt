c5TOGBUCCUUNBPM7h_KbmQ I wanted Mexican food and this was the closes to my house. They have a great selection on food. They have $1 doll tacos on Tuesday but it's only chicken. It was a little too plain for me and it was on a hard shell, I was hoping for a soft taco. I tried their  carne Asada soft taco and it was way better. I also had their plain churro and it was surprisingly soft. 

Restaurant is very clean which is always a plus
