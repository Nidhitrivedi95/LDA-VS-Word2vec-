6i4Sxo2dDvHU6lIiis0OUQ Outstanding...some of the best Mexican fare I've had in the valley and the service (from Gina) was absolutely outstanding. Most flavorvul guacamole I've ever had other than Barrio Queen - and the Carnitas were out of this world.

Well worth the trip to Talking Stick Resort for this little gem. The only thing I would recommend is to reformulate the sangria, which I thought was undrinkable. Great mojitos though!
