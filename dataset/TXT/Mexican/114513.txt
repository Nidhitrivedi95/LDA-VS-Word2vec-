GGecutXeoEVlYKoxVo2WPA When you wait 20 minutes in the drive through and get the wrong order it sucks. I ordered a #16 and got the totally wrong order. What's the point of drive 8 miles back the opposite direct. The chicken enchiladas sure don't taste like the cheese and a chilli relleno was what I wanted.
