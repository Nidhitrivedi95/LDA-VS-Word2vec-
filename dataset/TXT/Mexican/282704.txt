XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg One of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. I definitely recommend dinner over lunch menu. Haven't tried brunch yet, that's next on my list. A few of my favorite menu items: -the Mesa Burger (holy cow, Bobby Flay knows his way around a burger!)
-Pork tenderloin (never before and never since have I had pork tenderloin this good!)
-queso fundido (how can you go wrong with a skillet of bubbly cheese?)
Less than awesome menu items:
-the ribs (eh...wouldn't order again. Ate the other half of my hubby's burger instead of finishing my ribs lol)
-Chicken skewers (standard chicken skewers, nothing I couldn't get anywhere else)

Also, I've never had a bad dessert here. ALWAYS save room for dessert!
