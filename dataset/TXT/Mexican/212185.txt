qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A If you like your food with a little kick this is the place for you. A unique menu with lots of interesting choices. I will be sure to come back to try more.  I had the Enchilada dish and enjoyed it but the Jalapenio bacon was amazing.

Came back for brunch and the food was even better!
