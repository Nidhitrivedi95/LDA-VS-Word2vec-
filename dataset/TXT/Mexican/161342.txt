L-_-9JNAb6UDyq7waykX2A I was intrigued to try it when I saw the offer on groupon and because my fiance never had sushi before and I figured "Well he likes Mexican food and so do I" so this seemed like the perfect place for him to try it out. The place looks pretty to me honestly, I' am a person who prefers dark over bright light any day so perfect ambiance for me and he didn't seem to mind either. I went with the "Mexican Roll (Call 911!)" and he ordered hamburgers which kind of ticked me off because I wanted him to try something new but I got him to try a piece from my plate anyway. The wait time for the food was normal and once I tried it I instantly loved it. If you're the kind of person that LOVES spicy or hot foods I highly recommend getting the Mexican Roll. My fiance tried it too and loved it, and also loved his hamburger too. For dessert we ordered the fried ice cream, something we both never had before. I should've read the description on it though because its covered in coconut and I hate coconut but it didn't stop me from trying to eat it. The fried ice cream plate looked really pretty with strawberry slices placed perfectly around it with drizzles of strawberry syrup and hot fudge syrup, it was amazing. It all stayed under the groupon budget too (and yes we did tip). I highly recommend Senor Sushi!
