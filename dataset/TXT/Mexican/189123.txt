OACjhgf8nnYGzFnOhA7uhg Macho Radio Bar is located on Fort York near the condominiums that we stayed during our trip to Toronto. Given a few words, the restaurant / bar is clean, spacious, trendy, and offers an ambiance that suits well for yuppies.  

The menu is not as extensive, but it does have the necessary categories of drinks, appetizers, salads, tacos, and "macho plates." Prices are a bit higher and portions can be a little small, but that is kind of expected given the location of this bar. 

I ordered the smoked steak show fajitas:

- Included red peppers, poblano, red peppers, onion, tortillas. All of this is served with side condiments of onions, guac, sour cream, and the delicious green / red bottle of house hot sauce (4/5)

- The steak was tender and complemented well with the sauces and greens. The only thing to note was the portion was very small, as I was given three tortillas and a few slices of steak - a bit pricey (second most expensive dish), but again, remember the location and targeted audience 

Overall, Macho Radio Bar gets the job done for some decent Mexican cuisine in a more trendy and rooftop feel
