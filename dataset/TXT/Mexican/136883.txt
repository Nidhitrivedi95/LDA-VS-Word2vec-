IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA Really great place if you are looking for decently affordable food on the strip. I first came into the restaurant greeted with kind and enthusiastic service and delicious free chips and salsa. Order the carne asada quesadilla and the seasonal tamale dish. Both really flavorful and cooked to perfection. And the free margarita voucher from Yelp was a plus to the overall pleasing experience.
And WOW. Took an item off the check because a person at my table didn't like it. Excellent service.
