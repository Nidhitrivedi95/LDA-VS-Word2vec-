KjV_68oLLSpqR96VnV68tw Horrible customer service!! There's plenty of good taco joints in Vegas that have good food and nice service, don't waste your money at this robertos. It's a shame cuz the food at this location is not bad but I'd much rather give my money to a place where I'm not treated with attitude by the cashiers. 

The cashiers especially those in the drive thru need a major lesson in friendliness.
