o6Yor6ofIw2TqM3mN28Kzg Finally my friend brought me to this place to eat an El Salvadorea dish she has been raving about since the day I met her. Now that we work together it was a no brainer to go for some PUPUSA'S!! We hoped on the bloor-danforth line and arrived at cristy station. It was only about a 5 min walk to the restaurant and if you didn't know where you would going you would probably miss this Latin American gem located in the heart of Korea Town. 

The restaurant itself is very tiny, and probably mainly used for take out. We were fortunate to arrive their before the rush. We were able to get a seat among the tiny picnic tables located in the place. Each wall was painted a different colour but looked authentic. 

So because I clearly do not speak Spanish my friend went up to order me 2 Pupusa's  which are flour tortilla's stuffed with cheese, pork and re-fried beans. After you order you wait in your seat and the workers deliver it. They were served with red pickled cabbage and salsa. I couldn't believe how filling they were. They are definitely deceiving because they looked tiny but BAM! They must expand once eaten LOL. When they arrived they were beaming hot! That's when you know they are fresh and straight from the kitchen. I was a little disappointing in the actual flavour of these little patty's. I personally thought there would be filled with a bit more spice, maybe its the fact that I love things full of spice so I expect it. I recall packing  on the pickled cabbage and the salsa but then again maybe that's what you are suppose to since I saw my friend do that. Maybe I should try the other options as this one was the Mixed one (cheese & beans & pork) There were just cheese, just beans, just pork and squash options.

All in all I would go back to try a new thing on the menu when i'm in the area or if my friend is down to grab some food after work :)
