I'm a fan because they meet my standards, offer vegetarian options that are substantial and delicious - i.e, they aren't just limp vegetables on a taco shell. I go for the soyrizo tacos always or refried black beans. I kept trying to show a friend who was in town how yummy these are, but we seemed to miss them every time! 

Ingredients are fresh and flavorful. I haven't had a bad experience yet, and it is all cheap and quick. It doesn't get better than this for "fast" food tacos, plus it comes without the gastrointestinal disruptions later on, if you follow.
