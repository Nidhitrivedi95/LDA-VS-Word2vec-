bMSiHjs2fbKbBNPyuTwhHA Island vibe in the heart of Cleveland. Fresh squeezed juices, 180 degree view of the waterfront, big ole wood burning fireplace inside, ping pong, corn hole, jenga on the street side. Food is largely tacos or bowls (bols) + tamales and a coupla soups/salads/salsas. Portion sizes are on the small side but well priced. Vibe is relaxed and family friendly, the latter being a big win for the Flats IMO, the former bleeding over a little into service quality.
