I want to eat in peace.  Perhaps now that I am 43, I am an old fart, but really I just want to eat without music blaring.

The young adults working seemed to be in training.  Some of them appeared confused.  I did not see any paper menus around.  That is easier than staring up at a board.  I cannot imagine getting through the line at lunch in an organized manor.  Thank God it was not busy at 5pm.

I got an enchilada.  The tortilla was good and seemed pretty fresh.  Was not that impressed with the green sauce though.  They gave me a ton of beans which was good.  Guac is extra.  Yes, guac is always extra.  It was ok, needed more salt and lime, in my opinion.  The honey habanero salsa was awesome!  I really loved that stuff!  My favorite part of the meal.  So if the salsa is the best part of the meal.......I need to try a different meal I guess.

I like how everything is served in a potential take out container and that the lids are out where you can get them without having to get back in line.

I will try it again, but it seemed confusing to order.  Hopefully next time will be better.  I do think that it might be a huge cluster if I go for lunch though.
