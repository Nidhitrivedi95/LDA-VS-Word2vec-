N5CL5HLS6lyltw-OjjBrOw Great little spot in Boca Park. Great outdoor patio anytime of year position perfectly facing North so you dont get cooked by the sun.  Decent tequila selections but priced like you were on the strip. Cadillac Margarita was good and not made with the Crappy sweet and sour out of a plastic bottle. Craft beer also priced high at $7 a bottle. 

Chips and salsa were good. I liked to trio of salsas. One was a grilled pineapple flavor sweet with a hint of spice. Chipotle had a nice smokey flavor to it. The third was very refreshing almost like a bruscheta flavor. 

Elote was really good. Grilled perfectly with the right amount of cheese, mayo, and lime. 

Enchilada platter was a large portion of tres stuffed corn tortillas.  Choice of chicken, carnitas, or barbacoa.  I chose one of each and I think the carnitas was my favorite. Smothered in red sauce, radish and onion to finish this dish did not disappoint.  Green and cheese sauce is also available as a choice to top you enchiladas.  

Service was ok this visit. At times it felt rushed and others just lack luster. Good vibe here. I might come back for happy hour 3 to 6pm Monday thru Friday and Sunday ALL DAY!.
