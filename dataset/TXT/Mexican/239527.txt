T2tEMLpTeSMxLKpxwFdS3g Cabo is my favorite restaurant in all of Charlotte. Period. I have enjoyed every taco I've ever eaten here, which is many. The tacos are packed full of delicious, perfectly cooked fish and fillings. You definitely don't leave here hungry! The grilled salmon tacos and tavarua tacos are to die for! The only downside is that the wait is super long on weekends and they don't take reservations.
