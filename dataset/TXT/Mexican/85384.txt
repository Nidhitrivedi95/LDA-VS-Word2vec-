DaTQLers4x_DbGPi7r_xVw Cute little place. Short list of tacos and appies. Good if you can't decide. I had the chorizo, tinga and beef tacos. They were all good. Very simple, dressed with a tiny bit of cilantro (could have been a bit more) and raw onion. Two hot sauces are brought to the table. Nice and simple here. I like it and will be back when I want a quick meal.
