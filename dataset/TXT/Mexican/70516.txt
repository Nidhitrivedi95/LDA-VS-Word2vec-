Bz7XjJzwXURR-llBhA40Mg We went here for lunch as it was quite cheap (6 pounds for a main, 8 for a main and a starter).  We were very happy with the food, particularly the nachos melt we got as a starter, which was filling enough to be a meal to itself, made with what seemed to be home-made chips and salsa.  The burrito was also very good and filling.  I would recommend going for lunch, or only getting some large nachos -- the other dishes are too expensive for what they are on the evening menu.
