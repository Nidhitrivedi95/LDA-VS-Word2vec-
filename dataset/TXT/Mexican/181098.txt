ndXuzuD4BpNIrm1I0nTsww I'm giving this place two stars for pretty much the same reasons as everyone else has who has voted with two or three stars.

Mandatory valet on a Monday at 1:30, with two other parties in the restaurant makes no sense for anyone.  So I drove down the street for a block and parked in Old Town.

The decor is unique, colorful and beautiful. 

The food and drinks are good -- nothing stellar, but good., however the portions are minuscule for the outrageous pricing when it comes to both the food and the drink. 

I ordered the spinach and melon salad and a margarita. The way the salad and the dressing were prepared was quite original and interesting, there was just too little of it. You got about three sips from the $12 margarita, maybe four.

The service is marginal. My server was well-intentioned, but quite a vapid chap.  Firstly, he walked up to our table.....and just stood there smiling -- no words. Finally, I said, "Um, hi?", and then he started to talk. It was a very odd approach.

He brought me my drink with no straw. I was just about to get up and go ask the bartender for one, and the server returned apologetically carrying a straw with it placed politely inside a napkin versus coming in contact with his fingers (nice touch)....but then he dropped it on the table.

The server did come back to check on us and did return another time to ask if everything was still OK. I was finished with my salad, and he asked if he could remove the plate.  I said yes, so he picked up my plate AND my margarita that was 3/4 full. By the time I realized what happened, I had to call out, "Can I finish that, please?!"  He seemed surprised when he looked and saw that it was almost full, and brought it back.

I probably won't go again -- overall, the value just isn't there for the price.
