mHb5PqEb2qETQEPQXVVR-Q Went in for a late Snack about 9pm Ordered taco platter and double ck salad! As I'm pulling up I see the China cook yelling at the other employees! Like really buddy ! They should be yelling at him for running out of rice 1 hour before close and for being lazy and not making more because it only takes about 20 min to cook but he rather us sub our sides ! No Rice and I got burned Chicken ! It looked like it had been sitting and when ordered The china Cook just threw it on the grill and attempted to reheat it but failed because it was just Luke Warm because when I pulled up at home it's was all cold  and Tortillas for tacos weren't even heated up properly. I haven't  been to that pollo since about early may and same thing happened ! This place needs some attention! I called and Gal who answered was rude and not wanting to really help offered me more food like yea I'm gonna drive back for more old food and just hung up on me ! Didn't even apologize! sad! I think she forgot we pay her Paycheck!
