Everything here is pricey. The tacos here are between $3.75 and $4.50, the small bowl of guacamole is $8 and the drinks are about $9. 

They serve up a complimentary basket of chips, but charge you for refills. That INCLUDES the refill you need to eat the $8 guac you just ordered. Hard to believe the $8 doesn't include chips...

The food was tasty and the drinks were creative, but overall the experience didn't match the price.

I recommend going during happy hour. Maybe then you can still afford rent!
