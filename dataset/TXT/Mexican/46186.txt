7Q2cYSl5NBYytJzgjX0oKw While the food was good, the service is a lot to be desired. Our server Alex was not very attentive and spent very little time at our table. It took what seems like over 30 minutes to get our tab and pay.  Alex, be sure to take care of your guests and check back often! We hardly saw you!
