woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ This place is great. We came here for a graduation dinner and had a reservation.  It is loud here, but we sat upstairs and had a nice big table.  

We had a few apps and drinks, and the big taco board. We had the ceviche, poke, chips and salsa and the street corn.  The street corn was amazing, everything else was great.  We had a few drinks as well, the spicy cucumber margarita was very good.  

For the taco board, we had the baja, octopus, korean and the al pastor. All of them were great.

We were really impressed with this place, very good food and a fun atmosphere.
