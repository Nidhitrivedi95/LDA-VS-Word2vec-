VH2BjFjc9usDquDgoHhptA I love this place!! I live in Vegas and when I come home I eat here once or twice every time I am home. However this time it was horrible! They don't know how to seat tables! They sat two tops at a table ready for 6-8 people. Made parties of 6-8 wait way longer then they said. The hostesses don't know what they are doing. But the food is amazing!!!
