OPcGFLP_mRt9yvgP3ALXOQ Amazing food and service. I had the Chicken Chorizo tacos that came with rice and refried beans. My companion had a combo meal and ordered a taco and an enchilada, came with 2 sides and we shared the dip sampler. Guacamole had excellent texture and flavor, queso was creamy with just a hint of heat. I will be back. Complimentary chips and salsa when you're seated!
