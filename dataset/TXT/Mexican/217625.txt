r8hF3kwnZzxTo1IYNcI6rg I have a lot of respect for details. I would argue that details leave a indelible impression: always. 

From the feel of the silverware to the lightly dusted tortilla chips make this place a favorite. It is not ordinary. 

I was very impressed by the child pepper type spices dusted on the chips.  The salsa was unique as well.  There was the traditional 'smoky" flavor but then there was something with just a hint of lightness or sweetness.  Although, I don't know that sweetness is the correct adjective. 

I enjoyed my brisket enchilada but felt that the brisket was a bit bland for an enchilada.  However, the meat was tender and was still tasty.  I had a bite of carne asada and would recommend that meat if you are looking for a more traditional flavor.  Also, there was not  enough enchilada sauce on my enchilada.  I know this is a pet peeve of mine but I feel it is important.  There is a right balance for the sauce and I just don't feel it was met. 

The guacamole was very yummy. It tasted fresher than another very high profile Mexican restaurant I know, but there was a more dominant lime flavor that was very agreeable.  

The flan was truly a surprise.  It was textured (see picture) and the carmelized sugar was slightly burnt as is traditional in a flan.  It tasted great.  If you like the traditional smooth texture it might not be for you.  However, the carmelized sugar was very delicious and the flan itself tasted like a flan should. 

If you are looking for some Mexican comfort food with a twist this may be the place.
