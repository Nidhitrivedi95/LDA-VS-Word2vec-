2JUDgnmoLDxD97gqmand9Q This Chipotle is possibly the WORST Chipotle I've been to since I've lived in Phoenix. I've been here about 5 times and only had an enjoyable experience once. My friends and I went last night and got a chicken burrito bowl and a quesadilla. Literally everything in the burrito bowl was cold, including the chicken, beans and rice. The quesadilla was a chicken, cheese and fajita veggie quesadilla which was sorely lacking in the chicken and the veggies and we were charged as if it was a chicken burrito! 

Worst Chipotle ever. Never returning.
