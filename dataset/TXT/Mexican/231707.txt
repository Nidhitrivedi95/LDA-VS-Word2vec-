The salsa and bean dip are great with the chips. The habanero salsa is decent. I like that they have fideo soup before the meal it just give you that nostalgic feeling from your childhood. The entrées are very good but not great, that is what keeps my review at 4 stars and not 5. I had the Carne Asada and I could say I had better. Like I said very good, not great. The service, the place and the appetizers 5 stars the entrées just 4.
