SW6ZQk22G1_CV81_gfnvNQ I came here for a friend's birthday and my first impression of the place was small, hole in the wall, insanely loud, and insanely delicious.  

We started off with the empanadas, their special, and it was absolutely delicious.  The outer pastry/bread layer was crisp and the inside was juicy.  

We then tried a couple tacos and we had the following: 

1) Beef cheek - I actually don't know what the hype is about this taco.  Their beef cheek was definitely tender and it was no doubt, delicious.  I felt that it was good but it wasn't anything too too special. 

2) Carnita - I felt that the pork again was very tender.  However, I felt that this taco was the least flavourful amongst all the ones that I tried.  It was served as a soft taco so maybe the flavour was absorbed into the taco. 

3) In Cod We Trust - One of my absolute favourites. The cod was fried to perfection and the picked red cabbage made the taco pop!  This one is a must try. 

4) Tostada de Ceviche - MY FAVOURITE.  Words cannot describe how delicious this taco was.  This taco was a hard taco and the ceviche was indescribably good.  Thinking about it makes me salivate.  Definitely an absolute must try!!!

My friends & I then had dessert.  We tried

- Tres de Leche - I was much to full to actually be evaluating dessert properly but the inner part (so the cake & cream) were delicious.  What really ruined it for me was the peanut.  The peanuts really just...overpowered the flavour of EVERYTHING.  It wasn't too enjoyable.  

- Churros - delicious.  I think the reason why I found them so enjoyable was that they had the sweet taste of cinnamon and sugar on a fried cake-like texture stick.  You cannot go wrong with butter + sugar + cinnamon + cake thrown together and deep fried.
