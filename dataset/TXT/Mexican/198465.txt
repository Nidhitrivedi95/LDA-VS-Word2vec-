P8IsTiHq5Hesa6UPL604ww Lovely family owned restaurant. This is my second visit in 2 weeks. My daughter introduced me last week and I was highly impressed with the customer service and the food. Green chili tacos, yummy!
Unfortunately today was not a good experience. Girl (SHORTEST of all behind the counter with all black hair and braces) offered no hellos as we approached. My daughter greeted her but she struggled with a response. Seemed unhappy to be working yet greeted customers behind us. Customer service brings people back. Makes people talk about your restaurant. Also, my green chile tacos had no green chile sauce on it. I was sadly disappointed! I will think hard about returning.
