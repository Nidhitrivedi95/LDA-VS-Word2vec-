lOQPeguczAueJnLmDUTfGg If ur looking for authentic Mexican homemade food then look no further! Off the strip so its a total locals place! The decor, the staff uniform, the sopita de fideo, the beans, ughhhhh everything is HOMEMADE! I do wish the tortialls were hand made though BUT trust me u won't regret it! I had the cilantro steak n it was juicy tender and full of flavor! The food is delish! And its not greasy like some fake bootleg Mexican places ive tried out here! Am from Cali n recently moved to vegas in searc of some good authentic Mexican tacos n food like back home and FINALLY foubd this hidden gem!
