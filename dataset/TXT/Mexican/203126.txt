pomGBqfbxcqPv14c3XH-ZQ Well let me start off by saying if their was zero stars I would have chose it. When I arrived today I found the Hostess Melissa to be quite rude. I've never felt so unwelcomed when walking into a restaurant. BAD FIRST IMPRESSION!!! I was seated fairly quickly but had to wait a while before my drink order was even taken. I was served chips, salsa, and bean dip, thank god because my food took forever to come. And when it did come it was wrong WRONG!!! The server who's name I cannot recall but will post if I remember took care of it though, but not without a little attitude. The food was good but slightly over priced. 

Being who I am I still leave a tip, but thought I would also leave a review on here. I will say that I will not be back to this place ever again. It was the first and the last time.  I had already made my mind up when I had to deal with the Hostess. It's unfortunate to have to experience that when I'll I wanted to do was simply have some lunch.  

I will end with saying that you should really watch the people you hire and have working for you. Our maybe have a talk with them. If they are not happy with their job they should find another. It's not worth losing business over.
