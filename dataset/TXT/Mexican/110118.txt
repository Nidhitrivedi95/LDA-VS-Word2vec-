Fvd8qeJCXFbMYQk45S7iBQ I'm not sure what happenedto this place. Over the last 2 months they have not been as good as my previous experiences. The food is definitely not as good. The service is still above average, but the food has definitely taken a hit. I would classify them as a Filibertos with a wait staff... There are a couple of really good choices in Surprise for Mexican food. I'll be crossing this one off that list.
