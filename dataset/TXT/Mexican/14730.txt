0yYwrT1vYV0Jvzj74JjLqg I went in here for a quick bite. I had just went to my favorite taco shop on Lake Meade only to discover that they had closed.  The menu is pretty normal for a local Mexican place.  I ended up having the birria.  The soup was very good, they served it overfull so a lot of soup splashed on the plate and soaked up the napkins, which I needed.  The corn tortillas were not homemade but the order came with 5 tortillas instead of the normal 3 that I have experienced at other places.  the beans and rice were very good and they had a good selection of onions, tomatoes and cucumbers on the plate.  The goat was very well cooked and fell off the bones when you tried to pick it up.  The atmosphere was a little weird with a jukebox that comes on randomly at a very high volume.  There was a homeless guy there and they were doing a pretty good job of dealing with him and keeping him from hassling the other patrons.  This place is definitely a dive but the food was very good and I will stop in here again when I am in the area.
