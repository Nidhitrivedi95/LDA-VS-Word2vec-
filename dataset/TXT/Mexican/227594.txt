S3qs5ZAZgqDvM88jj17hbQ It's a total dive, but a wonderful dive. You don't come here expecting great service or great food - you come here because it's cheap, fun and it's a great place to kick off the night. I've been going here for years and I never regretted it - just don't delude yourself into thinking this is high-dining. It's a bar with Mexican food.
