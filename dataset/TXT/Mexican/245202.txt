TOrphxql7UfJ77vXG4G4aQ Waited 35 min for my "to go" food. Only to get home and realize it was the wrong order of pupusas. Ordered bean and cheese and only got mixed meat ones. I don't eat meat so it was a waste of my time and money. Called and told them about my order only to have them tell me to come in and exchange them. LOL okay yeah, wait another 35 min? No thanks. I'll go to the pupusa place down the street next time.
