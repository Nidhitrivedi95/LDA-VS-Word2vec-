drpzuRdT2xZql-wJhTC3gg I am a student, I workout, and I am also a vegan. I happened to go to this Chipotle after a class to eat. I have not eaten all day, and I just finished an exam, so I was eager to eat something. Upon my arrival, I noticed the place was dirty, after arriving towards picking my order (which was pretty quick, since no one else was there) I noticed flies flying around on the pinto beans (I usually get double beans, but I did not due to that) the employees were friendly, but it does not make up for that fact that they gave me a HALF ASS BOWL. Since I asked for a burrito bowl (which is the tortilla laid on the bowl). After flubbing my order, I did not say anything. I am incredibly grateful for what I have, and I know some people do not have what we have in current times. For instance, the people in Africa. Anyways, I watched as my what should have been a burrito bowl get passed around as I order what I want, they literally gave me a quarter serving of what I am usually used to receiving. I ordered sofritas, which is the vegan option, no one else orders it. It tastes atrocious, but it is vegan, and that is why I ordered it. I ended up inhaling my food due to how little the portions were, got up and left unsatisfied, and still hungry. All in all, this store has stingy employees, the place is not cared for, bugs flying around, and many things. I would not recommend to anyone to visit this place, I know I definitely will not.
