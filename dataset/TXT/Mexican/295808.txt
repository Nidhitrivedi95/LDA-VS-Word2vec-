ZCe93zAkxr2KOBU1NT0lmg We used to frequent this restaurant back in the day when I used to go Paintballing with my team just 5 miles north of here.

The food used to always be fresh and consistently delicious. And the service was always prompt and friendly.

After not having dined here for many years, we happened to be driving by and opted to stop and see how they were nowadays.

First of all, the service was extremely slow. Not sure if it was simply because they were short handed, or if there were just so many holiday patrons. But, after waiting for nearly 15 minutes for our waiter to come and acknowledge our presence, and take our drink order - we were about ready to just pay for the chips and salsa and walk out.

Speaking of the chips and salsa, they were still as delightful as we remembers. And they were at least promptly deposited in our table upon being seated. But, that was the extent of any timely service that we received.

I ordered the Grilled Carne Asada Red Chile Burro, and had a side of the classic Machaca Taco (their specialty). My wife had the Taco / Tamale / Enchilada Combo.

I am not sure what was going on in the kitchen that day, but our the cook should've toned down on the spices. It tasted like the red chile powder exploded onto our meals because they weren't just mildly spicy - they were extremely spicy!

And to top it all off, the meat on my Machaca taco was burned. It was so burned that it was crispy.

Speaking of burned, the topping on our Flan tasted of burnt sugar. 

I am not sure what happened to this place, but it has definitely spiraled downward in the many areas that it used to excel in!
