A8MmwHrMI0WnRTyQMdf8aQ The few times I have been to Square One, there is always a huge line up at Chipotle, so I never bother going despite it being one of my favourite fast food chains. I usually go to the Yorkdale location. I have also been to the Yonge and Eglinton location and have also tried their Buffalo NY locations.

I went early on Victoria Day so I did not have to wait in line! Looked like they had just opened as their fajita vegetables just came out. Best part: they give a LOT more food in the bowls than Yorkdale. Now I know you can pretty much ask more of everything other than the meat and guac at no extra charge. But the fact that they give much more without having to ask is AWESOME! 

"Would you like sour cream?" *BAM* Good amount of sour cream
"Would you like cheese?" *BAM* Tons of cheese 

I had an extremely friendly Asian worker who kept a smile on her face, even when I was being picky and asking my husband about which beans to put in my bowl lol - 10/10 from me!

Am not really seeing how anyone can compare this to Burrito Boyz. Burrito Boyz is cheaper and they give a lot of meat and free guac, but their freshness of ingredients is the trade off. I would say Mucho Burrito is much more comparable.
