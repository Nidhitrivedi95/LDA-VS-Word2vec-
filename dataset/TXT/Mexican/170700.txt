m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw I wanted to love Panchos because of its proximity to my home. So after not loving my first visit, I went back a second time in an effort to convince myself that I did. The ambiance is top notch, but the buck- I'd say it stopped there, but when you scan the menu... you'll see they've passed the buck onto you. For example a taco plate is $22.- for tacos! Not Kobe beef tacos- just regular tacos. 
I ordered a Titos Cosmo, it was served in a tiny martini glass with a teaspoon of Titos in it. It was more like receiving a communal sip of juice. Hardly enough to flush away this girls sins. The mahi ceviche was a 6.5 out of 10, and my à la carte  cheese enchilada was a disastrous, wet mess. My girlfriend ordered a simple cheese quesadilla which she found most palatable- at the tune of $17 (or more), I tried to verify this by looking the price up on their Internet menu, but... they don't show the prices on the Internet, curiously supportive of my claim that you're about to be gouged for food that you're likely to be disappointed with. 
The live band that was playing in the bar area was remarkable. The foliage and finely detailed surroundings are unlike any local restaurant. Due to the uniquely executed ambiance their rent must be extraordinary, unfortunately their food is not.
