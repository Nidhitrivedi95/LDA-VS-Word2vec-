BZtNKLg1S9k8s6fYkR1quQ The waitress Gabby, was slow and took forever to bring our drinks.  We ordered our dishes. After 10 minutes we were told one of their newer dishes weren't available and they could not substitute the beef dish I ordered with chicken.  I don't eat beef and they couldn't make a simple accommodation. The waitress apologized but seemed to think it was funny. May we just weren't "ethnic" enough for service. I will never go back and I urge everyone else to not visit as well.
