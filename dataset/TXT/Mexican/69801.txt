btA8NopfIYf7MAJ-KwhI3A Food is excellent, I mean EXCELLENT!  SERVICE LAST TIME WE ATE THERE WAS TERRIBLE!  We, a party of 5 walked in at 8:20 pm, ordered by  8:30,  and then a party of 10 walked in 10 minutes later,followed by another party of 2, followed by yet a another party of 2 and we still do not have our food 45 minutes later..I state to my family that I am waking out if we do not have our food in 10 minutes. So I set  my timer and my family and I got up, offered to pay for the drinks we ordered, they did not make us pay, and we left..     It's a shame for both parties because their food is phenomenal and we all like it and they just lost a lot of money since we eat there at least once a week and will be hesitant to return.
