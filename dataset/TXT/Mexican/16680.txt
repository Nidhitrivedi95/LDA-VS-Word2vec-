1fMXFNFwZEtTy9p8sEmiNw Anyone who knows me knows that I have a soft spot in my heart for Taco Bell. Nevermind that the soft spot is probably a deposit of fatty plaques as a result of my T-Bell addiction... the real point of the story is that I know my Taco Bell locations quite well, and this site is around the best there is. The service is always fast and surprisingly cordial, they give you an abundance of border sauces, and the tortillas aren't all mushy like at the low quality locations. I definitely hit this place whenever I need my fix.
