iBPSrhDr7IlfMywxCIp-wA I came in and ordered a green enchiladas entree with black beans and rice and a salad for my niece. Our food was delicious. They also give free quesadillas for kids under 6 years old which is great! Got one for my son. They have a drinks bar with so many choices. I tried their horchata and mint lemonade. The horchata was good. A little on the sweet end but with lots of ice it was still good. The mint lemonade was soooo good! Reminded me of a mojito lol. Two thumbs up from us. Will come back.
