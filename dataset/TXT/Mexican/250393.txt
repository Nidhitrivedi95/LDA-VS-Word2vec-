UJewG9UgVXQ7fyP4UHwnxw Originally came in t get elpastor. They said they don't have any today. Got the two carneasada tacos for $6.99 comes with a little bit of rice and beans. Rice and beans was bland. Tacos guac was good and fresh. The carneasada was okay nothing extradonary. Expensive for what it is. Service was also okay.
