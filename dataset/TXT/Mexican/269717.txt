woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ I can't believe it has taken me this long to write a review for Tako! Tonight was the second time I have visited Tako and it is easily becoming one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh! Both times I have gone during the week with my girlfriends. If you are looking to go here you basically need to make reservations weeks in advance... but it is so worth the wait.

The atmosphere inside of Tako is unlike anything I have ever seen before. From walking in and immediately seeing the cooks making their famous tacos, to the dim lighting and candle lit tables.  This place is sure to catch your eye. Both times I visited we were sat upstairs in the booths. I love that it is a private & intimate setting! 

We actually ended up having the same waiter both times I was there! He was very attentive & helpful. Tonight he recommended the watermelon basil margarita for my drink which was AMAZING! I have also tried the grapefruit sage margarita & my girlfriend got the sangria- you basically can't go wrong with any of their cocktails. To start, we ordered the queso fundido. I recommend to order this with tortilla chips instead of the warm tortillas that is typically served with. This is LITERALLY finger licking good. I am obsessed.  

For meals on both occasions I ordered tacos.....duh. My friends and I split the Korean, al pastor, and chorizo tacos a few months ago. We loved all of them, but I probably wouldn't order the chorizo again (we all agreed the texture & the fried egg we could do without). Tonight I had the carnitas, which were to die for. I truly believe you can't come to Tako and not have a great experience. There is nothing bad I can say about this place. Everyone needs to go to Tako!!!
