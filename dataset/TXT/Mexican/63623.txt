B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA A look around social media will tell you one thing about this place: people are going nuts for this place. 

I went at 11am which was good because I just barely beat the line that starts stretching past the door on most days (so I heard). 

The staff were friendly and helpful with making a selection. On this day, I did observe some confusion about what was actually in some of the burritos, so it was not the fastest line I have ever seen. 

Here is the thing: to me, sushi burritos are kind of just very large handrolls. I can see the novelty and it is cool that you can customize it. But I am really not the hugest fan. I love sushi and I love burritos and maybe I choose too "safe" of a sushi burrito but I did not see what the big woop is about. My spicy tuna was not as fresh as I normally like it to be. For the price and the amount that you receive, it definitely has value. I did enjoy my taro chips although the cheese sauce reminds me of Taco Bell nacho cheese sauce, which is quite low on my list of cheeses that I ever want to consume.
