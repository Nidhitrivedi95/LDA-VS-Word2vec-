XNWXyFgCGaAwvg9QML2Ypw Such ridiculous service. I have never been so disrespected by a server in my life. Went with 3 colleagues to this Mad Mex at 11 PM on a Saturday for just a few appetizers & margs. After being seated our waitress asked if we wanted waters to start, to which we said yes. She had someone else bring out the waters and when she came back herself she told us that one of our guests could not be served. The girl she was referring to had only had one drink before we arrived at mad mex, just like the rest of us. She was SO RUDE about it. We were shocked. Unfortunately I have witnessed an experience like this before at Mad Mex where I have seen a sober person denied service. Even though I have connections to the Big Burrito restaurant chain, I will no longer be giving my money to their restaurants. Unfortunate.
