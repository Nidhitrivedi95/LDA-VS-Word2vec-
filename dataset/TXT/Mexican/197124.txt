oxv2UyI5yF6yawPU20tOxA This is such a fun place to be! Best Margarita in town!!

We arrived with reservation but still had to wait, which I'm usually not a fan of.  But oh well, margarita will keep me busy for awhile.  We walked into the bar room, then someone came up and said that we can take the high table if we wanted to and order meals there. Yes! we don't mind to be seated early at all!  

We sat outside in the patio near the fountain, the outdoor is just so lovely with the sound of falling water and all the lights up between the trees and across the patio.  

The food was fairly good, with a bit commercialized flavor, meaning, it's not your home-made heartful type of mexican food.  I had quesadilla so it couldn't really go wrong.  But the portions were gianormous!!  We couldn't finish what we had and took the rest home.

Go there for the atmosphere! It's really fun!
