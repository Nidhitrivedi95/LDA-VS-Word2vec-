j0h8OH6ktQsnTmIaJsN5Hw Really good food and very nice staff. Temperature of food is generally inconsistent. Wish they'd improve their timing or use warmers or something.    Tacos and beans are often only slightly warmer than room temp. When the foot is served hot, it's really great. Overall this is a great place for lunch. Good size portions and comfortable atmosphere.
