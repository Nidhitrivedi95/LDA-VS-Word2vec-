knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw I came here once years ago, probably 2012 but I didn't post a review, and it was awful. Not much has changed. The drinks taste watered down and the food was...bland lack luster. It's what I would expect from a chain restaurant. But the chains are actually better. If you went to Abuelos you'd get better food for same or lower price. 

The space is beautiful and the service was pretty good. She didn't seem surprised that we didn't like the food.
