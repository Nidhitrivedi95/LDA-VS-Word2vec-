RWYQMss0RzbtDGGwRI3iaQ Oh well I am not sure where to start...

Randomly we decided to go to Chimichanga's tonight because we haven't been here in awhile. Yes the service is poor at best but we knew what to expect... Well we thought we knew. 

There is no heat in this restaurant, it was freezing cold inside! Their answer was " we don't have someone coming until Tuesday" I don't even know if you are allowed to run a restaurant without heat?

We decided to try and cope with the cold. My boyfriends coke had lip stick marks on the glass and it's hard to see in this place as lighting seems to be an extra option, but he noticed big lip stick marks so the manager I assume changed it. 

When it came back I took a little tip and it tasted very strong of lime, but wait there is no lime with this pop? Inside you can see little lime pieces from squeezing the lime in the first pop, he just changed the glass!

After that we just walked out, we were willing to pay to stay in a cold restaurant and pay 3 dollars extra to have a chimichanga when the restaurant is called Chimichanga? I still wonder why someone would call their restaurant a name and then charge extra if you want what the restaurant is suppose to have.. 

Overall, I have gave this place too many chances. Poor service, no one seems to care, the place isn't very clean to begin with, pricey average food and heat and lighting seem to be optional these days!
