nIwtGMkMyx0elLxVFs1D6A TIP:  Tacos plate comes with 4 tacos and it's waaay more than enough for a serving.  So unless you're super hungry, skip the apps!  You can't really take tacos to-go.

I'll hafta wait until December to know whether or not Aztec's Mine was authentic or not, but it was certainly filling, with very solid portions, without the hefty price tag!  Btw, why are tacos like $6 each in TO??!!

Located across the street from High Park, street parking along Bloor St. was not difficult to come by on a WEEKDAY evening slightly after the dinner rush.  :)

Servers were very friendly and there was also outdoor seating, if you're interested.  Gringos ain't running this joint, so it definitely was no Taco Bell/Chipotle/Burrito Boyz operation!  

We ordered:  Shrimp Cocktail, Mixed Tacos, Bistec Tacos, & I had a Mojito.  I didn't taste the bistec, but my mixed tacos (different stewed meats) were quite good, they do not skimp on the protein here!  Shrimp Cocktail was on the sweet side (ketchup-y?) and came with quite a bit of tortilla chips that we weren't able to finish.  I personally wouldn't recommend that app.  If their fish tacos are any good, I'll most likely orders those next time.

It's too bad that you cannot order individual tacos.

I'd definitely visit again, but skip the apps, get the fish/shrimp/or barbacoa tacos, and op for dessert!!!
