Full disclosure...after the Back to School Yelp event 3 months ago, I had my doubts about the quality of food at Tijuana Flats. I even compared Tijuana to Taco Bell! I know, I know...A little drastic right? I'm sorry Tijuana and I hope you will accept this apology letter in the form of a Yelp review :).

At the Back to School Yelp event, we were gifted a 10 dollar credit that expired on October 31. I don't really visit the university area too often so it took me a while to use my gift card. I visited on a Thursday. Before planning my visit, I took a quick peek at the menu and had a couple of menu items in mind. I definitely like that the menu offers nutritional information. When I arrived, the cashier immediately informed me of the Thursday special, a burrito, chips, and a drink for 5.99. I considered the special but still kept in mind the menu items I thought about before I arrived. The cashier was totally patient with me. I asked a lot of questions and went back and forth with my decision. Finally, I  decided to get the chicken and bean tacos on a wheat tortilla. I made myself to the sauce bar and tried out the siracha hot sauce; it was delicious with just the right amount of spice to compliment the tacos. My refried beans were a bit too smooth for me. I like texture, so I welcome a few chunks and lumps in my food :). I was satisfied with the overall flavor of my meal and would definitely go back.

P.S. Tijuana sells wine and beer which definitely sets them apart from Taco Bell :). Drink specials vary.
