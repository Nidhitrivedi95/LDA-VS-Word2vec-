QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA First time here visiting Vegas, the staff was very friendly, our waiter Jovanny was awesome! He went above and beyond for us, with suggestions and our requests. We ordered the Thai Nachos and the Vegan Loaded Nachos, both were great. The white queso and spinach chips used on the Thai Nachos were so good. I will definitely make this place a must visit next time I'm in Vegas.
