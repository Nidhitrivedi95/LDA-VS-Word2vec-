eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw Stopped here for lunch. Had chips and salsa, not overly impressed. Hot salsa was not hot, medium was very mild. However...ordered the tacos (American beef for me, Signature pork for my husband) and they were AMAZING! We were very impressed and will definitely be back again. Drinks were cold and served quickly. Great Mexican food at Fremont St. 
**Update** 
 We never eat two meals at the same place while on vacation but we loved Nacho Daddy so much that we went back for dinner. We ordered tacos and nachos. Again, loved every bite. Go to this place. You won't be disappointed.
