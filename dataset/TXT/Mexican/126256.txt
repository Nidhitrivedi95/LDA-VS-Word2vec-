HU8MnV129kOK4m0ZH4GpCg Didn't have the greatest experience at this restaurant. Given I went on the first day of being hot, the patio filled up. We were really hungry so we decided to eat inside. 

Although we sat near some of the light source of the restaurant it was pretty dark and very loud music, at one point I could even hear them turn it up even louder where I found it hard to talk to my girlfriend who was sitting right next to me.

From time of order it took a long time for us to get our food, I'd say around 45 mins. We just sipped on our waters and waited.

With all that said, the food. Tbh I was hungry so I thought it was okay. I got the Mexican Dirty Rice and others in my party got the Wet Burrito and the Chicken Chimichanga. If anything I would say all the food kinda tasted the same with minute taste distinctions and different textures. I kinda felt that the wet burrito was just my Mexican Dirty Rice in a wrap. 

Another note to add is that I feel adds if the food is overpriced for the portions you get, taste doesn't really make up for it. The wet burrito and Chicken Chimichanga were both $16 without tax/tip and the Mexican  Dirty Rice was $13 without tax/tip.

I personally wouldn't come back here on my own
