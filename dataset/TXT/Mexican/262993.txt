W2RNay2mirTVPYO6rA_g2g Worst line ever! Every time no matter what, the wait takes forever. I this weren't the only Lakewood chipotle, I would never come back. As an update we made the mistake of going here again, only to be told they were out of burrito wraps! There were some sitting on the counter and they refused to seek it to the people in line because they were saving it for online orders. What a joke.
