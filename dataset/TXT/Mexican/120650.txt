H-B_JoResY4PyXND1_DQfg For fake Mexican food, this place is great!

If you're in the mood for interesting burritos and delicious margaritas, Mad Mex is truly the place to go. I mean really, where else can you get Thanksgiving dinner wrapped in a burrito? 

The downside? its noisy, its a tiny building, and its busy. If you can look past those three, you're gonna get a great meal!
