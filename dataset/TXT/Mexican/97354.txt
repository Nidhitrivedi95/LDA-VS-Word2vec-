eJPckkV1k7gn0V2awA1pzA First time here and definitely not my last time. :) 

In my book... Anything that SoHo...uuummm... Chef John starts is fantastic!! The flavors are always on point and the service is always 5 star. 

I could just stop here since the food and the service is always amazing at all three of their locations... This one being their newest location... BUT i won't. :)

When i drove by this place, i was wondering how the business was since the whole area seemed a little dead to me. But i could tell that the business was rocking as soon as i walked in.

I ordered their steak roll... And I added jalapenos and it was delicious!!! Service was dead on as well. The staff was young but totally all over it. 

I like how you can customize it to either get the sea weed paper or the soy paper... Brown rice... White rice or sushi rice.

I also tried their spam and eggs... Delish! I don't know what it is but I have to say that I like them more then Jaburritos down the street.

Chef John is awesome and I'm glad that a local guy can make it. 2 thumbs up! I'll definitely be back!
