89uU51kOiQXbJHVA3C6XMQ Had beef flautas with guacamole and rice and beans. The taste of all of the ingredients finally reminded me Mexico which is great! But! I wish guacamole was something like a salsa not just smashed avocado. That means - I lacked a lime, chillis and coriander. Jap! They had their own red salsa which was ok but I lacked some picote taste. 

Also, yes it looks quite simplistic there and you wouldn't go there in a cocktail dress like I ended up. And they have no beer! I would have really enjoyed a coronita with my flautas!
