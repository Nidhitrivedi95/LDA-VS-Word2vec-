FMo1PJTUV5OpyiZlnTM1Rg We were excited to try this place out but we are certainly disappointed. The food was very average and bland. The restaurant has a large menu and we ordered several dishes (nachos, fajitas bowl, tacos, kids's quesadilla) to share. They have a salsa bar which was nice. I don't think we will return soon.
