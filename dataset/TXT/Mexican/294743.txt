za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw I would give a higher rating but since I only experienced breakfast, I'm reserving those marks for an update. It is cozy and welcoming so you can't go wrong, especially stepping in to find a Patsy Cline-esque wooing you to take a seat. Blueberry pancakes were my fave, with a side of hash browns covered in oozing homemade hot sauce. You can't go wrong with that sauce. And if you sit on the patio, particularly on a random rainy day in Scottsdale, you feel like you've been transported to a time of simplicity!
