gEv1Og5uGDLw9HkbKSGUZw Loved this place! I am not a fan of going anywhere in the core but as a person with celiac when I hear of new Mexican joints I get googly-eyed and all other judgments flop.

When I got there, I didn't even realize I had as there was no obvious signage (that I could remember). It was a cute hole in the wall, which is what we are all looking for, right? You walk in and it's quite dark with some hot pink accents throughout.

We were greeted by a very friendly host and since we were 8:00 walk-ins we were offered a seat at the bar. I had no idea it would be so busy as it was quite new, but word gets out fast when there's a new taqueria in town. 

There is coat check which I was pleasantly surprised by. Either they learned from Momofuku's mistake or they are trying to create a lounge feel. I believe it is both as the restaurant has large booths to fit at least 10 people and offers bottle service.

Our seat at the bar was great, our server was very friendly and had some awesome suggestions for us. 

Food & Drink
- Manny's Margarita: our server told us it was the most popular. I loved it except I think I glassed over the peppercorns listed on the drink. It was still great and definitely gave it a kick.

- Blondie: Loved the top part, but the bottom had what I thought was blue curacao but it's not listed on the drink (not a fan).

- Chips & Fresh Salsa: loved this because it came in a perfect portion size - sometimes you are given way to many chips for the dip. The salsas come in a tower of 4 starting from mild all the way to hot. I think I can handle hot but this top 'salsa' may as well have been ground chili peppers...I still loved it:) The salsa verde is what I was stuck on.

- Flank steak taco: HOLY MOLY. This was fantastic. I am not quite sure what made it so amazing but it was to die for. It came piping hot, I had to wait for it to cool which only made me love it more because I love knowing food has come right off the stove!!! It was falling apart as I ate it but they are smart and give you the taco on top a thin paper on a tiny plate. I obviously took advantage to use this as a facilitator and lose as little food as possible.

What I loved in general is that I felt it was really focused on actually getting authentic food....not just presentation and frills. Seriously I cannot remember the last time I got food at a restaurant that was so hot I had to wait to eat it. 

I pretty much fell in love with the cute little place. We got there are at 8 and it looked like a nice dinner crowd but by the time we left at 10 it was more of a bar/lounge with people mingling and the dj booth getting setup. I'll definitely be back for a longer night there!!!
