fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg This place was on my radar for a while now. A group of friends decided to go and try it out since all we have been hearing about was that the trash can nachos was something we absolutely needed to try. So we decided to go and before you know it we had a group of 10 people! (We roll deep!)Lol!

This place is located inside the Rio hotel and Casino, not far from the main entrance. It opens at 5pm and closes at 11pm so if you want to try it out, plan accordingly. The restaurant it self has a good vibe, and has a lot of cool decor on the walls and has a cantina style feel. I want to give you guys a heads up and tell you about the attire, this place has big window walls that over looks the pool area so don't be caught off guard if you see guest in there with shirts, and bathing suits. I'm not gonna lie, that one threw me off guard just a  bit since your use to the no shoes, no shirt, no service policy in many places but what the hey right, it is Vegas and it is the Rio!

Now, the good stuff, the food! The trash can nachos we came for, the reason for being at the Burro Borracho! The larger size Trash can nachos will cost you $32 you have a choice of meats which are on the Menu. It is suppose to feed up to 5 people....yeah well if your a Yelper it will feed two people! The trash can nachos were good, it was more of the fact that they were presented to you in a Large tin can which makes the experience cool, and different. To be honest you can probably go to a mom and pop shop and get the same quality for a whole lot less. 

The desserts that were ordered look like good portions, and those were something two people could share. I didn't actually taste them because I was too full for desert but they looked very pleasing, the churros looked good, as did the deep fried ice cream.

Over all a good, and fun experience at the Burro Boracho.
