TQPxHfKykLLG6echeHru-g I love this place! The food is good and the menu is varied. It reminds me of some of the more casual restaurants in the Mission in San Francisco. The fish tacos are good and the portions are decent without being overly large . As a plus they sell items as a grocery store too.
