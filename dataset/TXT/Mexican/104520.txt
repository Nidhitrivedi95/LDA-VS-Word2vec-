FGaaHr_krwaPGlD0mHPe4Q We were a party of 7 visiting from Los Angeles, Nevada and Arizona. Dominic was our waiter and the service was excellent. He was very funny, courteous and attentive and made the visit a highlight of our trip. We had chimichangas, fish tacos chorizo and eggs, a taco-tostada-enchilada combo and the Spanish Rib Eye steak. Every dish was tasty and plentiful - you won't leave hungry. The most memorable part was the homemade tortilla chips and homemade salsas - 5 to choose from. It was so good we bought a few jars to take home with us. 

Thanks for a great time and memorable experience. Well definitely be back next year. Go Dodgers!
