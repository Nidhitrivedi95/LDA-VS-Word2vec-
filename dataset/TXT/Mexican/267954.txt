wl6s30wPQWh-FepHkPedyw .for those that read my reviews you know Wednesday's my work always has a different food truck vendor come to feed us. I was really excited to see Taste of Mexico was there because I've heard great things, and have a new found love of New Mexican style food. Green chilies are amazing! After talking with the girl taking the orders I decided on a green chili pork taco and a beef and potato taco. The meal also came with chips and salsa. For a $1 more you could get a soda as well. I love, love, loved the green chili pork. So much flavor, spicy, and just so tasty. The beef and potato however I was not a fan of. It had no real flavor and the potatoes were small and reminded me of frozen breakfast potatoes. Their chips and salsa were great and the salsa was hot and perfect. I'd buy it if they bottled it for sure! I also wanted to add how fast and pleasant the service was. Great job!
