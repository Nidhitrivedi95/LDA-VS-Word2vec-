uCDVOidGLpD-Q7_y82nx2g It's not the fanciest place, and the neon lights can't be flattering, but this place has delivered EVERY time I go.  Authentic, flavourful Mexican food that is difficult to find, unless you are near a bus station in Mexico.  I find it much better than the tacos at Asador down the street (which in all fairness is Salvadorean, so you should really just stick with the pupusas...). I always get the Mexitaco platter, last time I came here with my sister it was gone in about 8 minutes.  It's that TASTY.
