:) 
They have taco times where i am from in Washington state so i was stoked when i found one in las vegas. The crisp burritos are the bombness! The original hot sauce is so packed with flavor and goes perfect with a crisp burrito or mexi fries aka tots cooked to perfection. Will always stop here when in area.
