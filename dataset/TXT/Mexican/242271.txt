TdoLDxiqDKbk_lmni5nu6A I loved the prices and flavors. The salsa bar is thuper good and I like the carrots. The gentleman behind the counter is very sweet and kind. No fountain drinks but they do have 12 different drink options (Mexican coke and such). 

Loaded the quesadilla with chicken. Tacos are $2 and covered with meat. Great flavor. Better than Roberto's. 

Totally made with love.
