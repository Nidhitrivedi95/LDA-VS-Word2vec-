Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg Ugh my first not so lovely review ! The customer service in this place is good but !! After waiting 45 mins and having the man come back and ask what our orders where again I was a little annoyed. Another 15 mins and our food arrives it is the complete opposite of what I originally told the man I wanted I'm beyond disappointed and will not return my business my kids ordered the chicken strip fry meal they have and the fries where horrible. Not to mention they bring out a soup with the chips and beans that they automatically charge you for. Would have been nice to no I was getting charged for what I had no intentions on eating !!
