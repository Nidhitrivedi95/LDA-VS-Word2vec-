QUdJyyDDieR_kdrCU9dPFA Better than Chipotle. Like, a lot better. 
There are so many options here and I've been pleasantly overwhelmed every time I walk in. Despite all of the options, I usually get the same thing - the grilled chicken naked bowl. I ordered the mole once, and the gentleman behind the counter warned me that it has a chocolate base and might not be what I'm looking for. I'm glad he said something! He let me try it, and it was delicious, but it definitely was not what I wanted. 
They have multiple proteins, many types of cheeses and veggies, plus different herbs (like cilantro) to add. I love how customize-able everything is. Also, everyone who works there seems to love their job! They are always smiling, chatty, and helpful. 
This place is becoming a regular stop for me!
