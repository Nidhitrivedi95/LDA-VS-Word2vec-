57aBx6Mo_VRk_kMA8J5Efg Yay!  I finally found a good authentic Mexican restaurant in the Charlotte area!  

I had a craving for Mexican and tried this place out with my husband the other night.  The service was fast and the food was great.  I ordered steak tacos and got a side of fried beans and rice... Everything was very good!  The tacos came with onions and lettuce so next time I'm going to make sure to ask for cheese and tomatoes.  If you're looking for really good authentic Mexican food, put on your finest t-shirt and sweatpants and head over here!  You won't be disappointed.
