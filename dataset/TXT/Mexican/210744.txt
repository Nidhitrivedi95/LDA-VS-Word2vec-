qnn9E-e9orYf_wK37yLTYw This was our first visit here, I took my wife out for date night and we were looking forward to trying this restaurant. We ordered the salad with fresh grilled Mahi-Mahi and it was excellent. Then we ordered a chicken poblano cheese crisp. The cheese crisp was good but the chicken was a bit bland. I had ordered a carne asada burrito enchilada style with green sauce.

This is where things started to go not so good. They had delivered the salad and cheese crisp fairly quickly but the burrito was not so quick. After waiting for more than 20 minutes for the burrito I had ordered it was finally delivered but with red sauce, not green sauce, which is what I ordered. By this time I was pretty full from the salad, cheese crisp and the chips and salsa, which were also pretty good, so I ended up sending the burrito back.

Although there were some issues with our dinner the service was absolutely amazing, our server was excellent and he management ended up taking great care of us. We are hoping to try this restaurant again and I am looking forward to updating my review.
