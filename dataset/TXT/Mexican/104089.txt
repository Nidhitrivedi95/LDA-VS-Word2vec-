fbQaKW0Lte0JQ_opbnjdKg I have lived in the valley for 23 years and this is one of my absolutely favorite top 3 restaurants in the city. It's fast casual, chipotle style enchiladas but every ingredient is made from scratch right in front of you. 

The food has incredible depth of flavor. Every component has been flawlessly executed every time I have been here. 

The ambience is casual and often very crowded. The owner is almost always running around and is super friendly.
