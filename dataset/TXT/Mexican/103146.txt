F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw received an email from owner/mgr. apologizing for the terrible service. was offered free dinner to make-up for it, but i declined. i know somebody that worked there and they told me that it is policy to move the customers quickly, in & out, to turn tables fast. i won't be willing to give them a second chance, even for free. thanks, but no thanks! IF I COULD GIVE ZERO STARS, THEN THIS PLACE WOULD GET ZERO!!  this place is one of the WORST restaurants i've ever been to. i'd go to taco bell before this s-hole!!!
