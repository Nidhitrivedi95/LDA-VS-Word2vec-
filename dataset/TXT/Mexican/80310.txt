CXvOT4DP2ajswWvZHuMKRA Just tried this place out for the first time with the family. We ordered the Supreme Nachos w/ shredded chicken, and the Sabor Especial. Was extremely impressed with everything, including the service, quality of food, and the flavor! The portions are huge...we couldn't finish everything. We will definitely be coming back!
