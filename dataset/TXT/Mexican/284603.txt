xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw The place is a dump . But it has good food . We tried their chorizo  fry bread this had red sauce and had a nice spicy kick. We always love their green chili fried bread the portions seem a little  bigger than normal . At the counter they pushed for a tip . . Parking lot is Huge
