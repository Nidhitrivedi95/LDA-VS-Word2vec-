7-DOaIot_ncSkhdmFx1mBw It's a tough call because a friend likes this place but, I just think everything is mediocre at best.   I've gotten a few different burritos and taco combos and haven't been wowed.  The rice is ok, beans are a little salty for my taste, and everything else doesn't have much flavor.
