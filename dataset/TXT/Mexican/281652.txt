XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg In Vegas with my daughter. She loves Bobby Flay and had decided to have last meal (lunch).

Good decor, expected simple, but great food. Our appetizer, Goat Cheese "Queso Fundido"  was creative and very good. Daughter ordered Spicy Chicken + Sweet Potato Hash. This too was very simple, creative dish as expected with Flay perfection. 
Wish I had been more adventurous, went with a Mesa Burger.

Burger was ordered as 'medium'. Got served with cold fry's and they replaced it in a timely fashion. Very disappointed with the Burger...... it was way over cooked, heavy char-grill. Now running out of time to leave for airport, did not bother calling server. Left it uneaten with couple of bites. Told server of my order and he just ignored it with no apology not did he offer to take it off the bill.

Taking it off the check is not an issue, in my opinion, prices are very reasonable. other wise it was a good experience, but the burger and the server's attitude left a sour note.
