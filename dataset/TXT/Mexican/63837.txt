B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA This place is awesome! Sushi burrito there is nothing el to say lol. This line service concept is taking over in Vegas! With tacos, pizza and know sushi. And I think is good as long as the offer fresh and good quality products! This last time I went it was raining and the place was packed mostly people on their 20's and not many families line move very fast which is always appreciated,
