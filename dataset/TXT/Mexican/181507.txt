nemcwBBzPuTbP9oKF9t_Jw We came here on weekday night. As a long time Riverdale resident I'm  always very curious and hopeful of new food options opening in the area.

Me and my partner started off with Guac and chips, at $7. The chips seeming like the real deal, (fried and fresh) were disappointing. They were not not warm and about half had lost their crunch. 
The Guacamole was also disappointing, we both remarked how it seemed like basically raw avocado mashed up  with some red onion sprinkled throughout.  

The tacos themselves were quite good. Together we had the Korean chicken, fish, and shrimp on the tostada. At $5 a pop decent portion and fair value. Good flavours, the fish was fried very nicely. 

The Service was quite nice, prompt and with a smile. 


The decor is nothing to write home about, 
fairly plain. My worry is this place is too large, and it's on the stretch of the Danforth where foot traffic decline sharply east of pape. 

I hope this place succeeds but they've got to up there game if they're gonna compete in the busy restaurant world of the Danforth. 

As a side note, if you're going to use paper menus, they should be in good condition when given to the customer. Perhaps laminate ? Or I've seen clip boards work quite nicely too.
