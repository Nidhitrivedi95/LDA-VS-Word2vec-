plHKBwA18aWeP-TG8DC96Q We came here as a group of 9 people. You could previously use the "No wait app" for Smoke, but when we turned up, they told us, that this is not the case anymore. For us that was not a problem. But from that moment on, everything with Smoke turned out to be a problem for them. First, we couldn't put our names down until all 9 of us were there, which unfortunately took a while. The receptionist was quite rude and unfriendly, but my friends decided that it's worth the wait. They told us it would be about 1.5 hours, so we headed to a bar first and then came back.

After coming back, they still made us wait for about 10 min, so we started looking at the menu in order to be able to pick everything straight away once seated. In the meantime my friend walked through to the bathroom, where the receptionist ran after him trying to stop him, telling him he's not a customer and not allowed to use the bathroom? It took some discussion that we are actually waiting to be seated.

I wasn't really impressed with the tacos they serve. I had 2 vegetarian options and added meat to it (as the vegetarian option seemed to have much more flavor to it). The portions as others have said are quite small for the price you pay, and I wasn't overly blown away by the quality and taste either. It's tacos that I can prepare myself at home and they would probably turn out better. 
And in addition, the cash only is another thing that is quite annoying with Smoke.

All in all, I am definitely not rushing back as there are so many better options for dinner in Lawrenceville. And in my opinion Smoke definitely does not live up to its reviews/hype.
