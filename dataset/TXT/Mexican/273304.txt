wYSWgZMiMJxfusnxeWKYXg Great presentation of food! The pictures of the food brought me in, and were just as pretty in person. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my taste buds. 

The price was crazy affordable for the budget savvy. Everything all together was $26 Amazing! 

Beverage:
Horchata- Very sweet and had a cinnamon flavor
Water with lime- good!

Cheese quesadilla- with cilantro & onions - Good! Just  had an excess of cheese, & I'm a cheese lover. It was also pretty greasy, the oil dripped off of it. The salad was ok (comes with a red sauce that tastes like a red ranch) this was ok. The other side items are pickled with jalapenos. Yikes, that was a real wake up to my taste buds. 

Shrimp Burrito- my friend thought it was not great, but edible. The red sauce that covered the burrito was surprisingly sweet and my friend didn't like it at all. She didn't touch the rice or salad after the shocking jalapenos made her eyes and nose run. 

Rice- not going to order again! Not great.

Cheese Pupulsa - a cheese filled corn tortilla - if you like corn you may enjoy this. If not, like me, it will sit on the plate.
