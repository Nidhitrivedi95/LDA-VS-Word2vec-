XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg We always have to stop for a meal when in Vegas. The cactus pear margueritas are so good. This trip we ordered the lobster tamales, the Brussel sprouts, the fundidoes and the chicken black bean quesadillas. I think we would have passed on the fundidoes. Especially since we got the churros. Dang! So good. Save room for these puppies! The dips were so good.
