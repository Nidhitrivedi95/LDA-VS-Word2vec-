ExDYoLUru6wMcAmcSYwM3w First timer...and last timer. $8.90 for a 5 and 1/2 inch Carne Asada burrito that contained mostly wilted lettuce. What little meat that was in there was ok...just could have used more. A bag of chips to go that were probably over five weeks old...stale and tasteless. For that kind of money, I could have gone to Del Taco and get more food! Seriously, please avoid this place. Ricky Abril...if you're reading this.....shut this place down. You're just stealing people's money for this low grade 'food'. 

I hope I don't get diarrhea......
