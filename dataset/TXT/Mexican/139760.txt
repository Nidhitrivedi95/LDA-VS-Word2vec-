The epicurean delight then started with bacon stuffed jalapeños that were delicious enough to convert any vegetarian to being a a purveyor of the fat back. Next came entrees of carne asada, short ribs with a hint of green chilie to remind you what defines great Mexican food. For the Pesci lovers the special of the evening u had to sample just for the Halibut! To finish of the explosions that were detonating in my mouth, I had to gently settle down my taste buds with carmel glazed bread pudding that hit my sugar meter and finished me off as I slipped into my food coma.... a great treat for all ages! All that was left is for me to leave was just the tip!
