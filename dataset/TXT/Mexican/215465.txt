QYuojrlW94mpEwnp0uUIWA Ok. Read the reviews. They understate what is going on here. 

When I arrived at 6:15 on a Thursday the place was empty. Scary. Decided to go for it. In twenty minutes the place was packed!

Good call. The A1 burger is and the chili cheese fries will scare a cardiologist to death. 

Pray that Guy the Menace from DDD does not discover this place and turn it into yet another tourist trap with the obligatory signed photo. This place deserves to keep the authentic funkiness.
