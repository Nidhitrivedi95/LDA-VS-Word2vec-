_u1Bq7QsgMUXSMex8QHqLQ Wow, now that was a burrito! I've been here once on a quick trip to Toronto. Good anytime but ideal as late night food. There's a great range of burritos including fish and, I think, veggie options. I had a halibut burrito, after all halibut is the king of fish!

One caution, there is a hot, medium or mild option. I prevaricated between the hot and medium, but choose medium.  I'm glad I didn't choose hot because the medium made steam come out of my ears!

I'd definately go back.
