cr84hpeFeas6N6VGV7Iu3A I came with my family to try the chicken mole. Having had many dinners at my Latino friends, I had come with certain expectations and I'm glad to say those expectations were met. The mole was excellent. Not too spicy to burn your tongue off, but not too mild either. It took a while for the food to come, but I've come to understand that something like this is worth waiting for. An enjoyable and satisfying experience.
