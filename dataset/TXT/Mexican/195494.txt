oVJoGIPWFPrWZG1XcSYVow I take off a star for the price which isn't to bad which is why it's still 4stars, but I feel there should be a price break when buying a dozen or more at least maybe even for half dozen. We all like to save money, and when buying bulk usually there's a price break even if not much, a few bucks still adds up. They could definitely make the inside less dingy/brighten it up and make it more welcoming, but all that aside I love the tamales! & that's why I go!
