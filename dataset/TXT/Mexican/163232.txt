LE94B7yvaxh0l_wh_yEpjg overall the flavors were very authentic.  the ceviche was tangy, the flank steak salad spicy and lengua (beef tongue) tender and tasty.  we also had the tostada chicken.
we also tried all 3 desserts available; everything was not on the sweet side which we preferred.  the limon was tart, the chocolate cake with rose petal sorbet bitter and the hot chocolate drink was flavorful.
however, the hot chocolate drink was espresso-sized compared to what you'd get at Soma Chocolatier for about the same price.  also, out of all that we ordered, the ceviche was the priciest one at $15.  but it was a very small serving as 1/3 of the small bowl was filled with the chips.
i would go back if i crave for authentic mexican flavors again but i wouldn't order the ceviche or dessert again.
