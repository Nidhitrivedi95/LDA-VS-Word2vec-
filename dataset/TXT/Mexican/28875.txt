3Ustrt5-0Q-TmkpxxzINng Good Food with a great atmosphere with staff that really love their restaurant. I met the owner who is Fijan and lovely.  The original La Mexicana is SO awesome, this place is an extension of that and I'm sure will get better and better as time goes on.

Bottom Line: LOCATION. The Sobey's plaza has never had a good restaurant, and Thornhill as a whole has no mexican food!!!! Thank goodness for this place, please eat there so they stay.
