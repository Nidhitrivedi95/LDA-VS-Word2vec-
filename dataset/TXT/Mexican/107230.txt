fqMAnoS2sTokz6lqBSmoCw Thanks to yelp we knew what to expect when we arrived here on a beautiful Saturday afternoon.  A pretty day is the best time to visit southbound, they have one of the coolest indoor/outdoor patios in town.  We started off with chips and guac, we ordered a large for $10 and the guac was way to small to be called a large but we were expecting that so it did not deal us a big blow.  We also ordered the street corn and for $3, it is the best value on the menu.  Perfectly roasted, topped with white sauce and queso fresco.  I would come back just for the corn, myself.  We were told that the salsas are for the tacos to be topped however you like but we still went to the salsa bar and loaded up the little cups for the chips.  The little cups are cracking me up as if they are going to deter people from using the salsa bar for their chips.  They didn't deter us!  We ordered the platos mexicanos, which is what I recommend you do.  They are like deconstructed tacos you make yourself.  I had the carne and Taryn ordered the chicken mole.  The carne was just perfect, I loved it and for $10 I thought the portion was fair.  She really like her chicken mole as well, shredded chicken with an ok flavor, not my fave, but she liked it!  The tortillas were the bomb, handmade, fresh and really tasty.  The food was really good but best part of our experience was our waitress Brooke.  She was very informative about the style of food and what to expect when we ordered.  She made the visit a success!  See you again soon Southbound!
