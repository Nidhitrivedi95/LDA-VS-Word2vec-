9IZX6ctv4ea6mc9gzu1flQ Great food, great salsa, great service.  One of my favorite places to eat in the Valley.  The staff is attentive and friendly and the food is amazing.

Fair warning - if you don't like spicy food then this will not be the place for you.  If you are a fan of New Mexican style spicy food then you will love this place.  The different salsas are bold enough to make their presence known without overpowering the flavor with searing pain.  I really like this place.
