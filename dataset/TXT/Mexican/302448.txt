zwNC-Ow4eIMan2__bS9-rg Meh. I ordered two tacos al pastor and an elote. The elote had a decent flavor, but they shouldn't have gone so easy on the toppings. The al pastor didn't have very much flavor, so I was disappointed. 

I'd go again to give this place a chance to redeem itself, but that's about it. 

On a positive note, the place is copacetic and spacious. Nice interior.
