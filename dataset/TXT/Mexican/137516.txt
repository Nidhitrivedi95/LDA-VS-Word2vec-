ITOa1olD2HTgEVOnH8zVog We've all been to scores of fast food taco stands, this one is top notch. Excellent grub, the full range of menu items, the food is just better here. I think it's better than Carolina's.

Update: I had to remove a star from my review due to the fact this place can't keep up with its popularity. Sunday at 1:30pm waited 35 mins for our food, far too long for pre-made grub. The order wasn't correct either
