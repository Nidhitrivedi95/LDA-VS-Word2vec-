XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg So I went here on a whim by myself after winning some dough, and I was not disappointed.  First off, it's less expensive than some of the other restaurants on the Strip, but it is far from cheap just to let you know.  I ordered a margarita, with my choice from a bewilderingly long list of tequilas, with some kind of other liqueur in it, which was pretty good, but definitely don't get the shot of liqueur... couldn't taste the difference.  

But that steak I ordered?  Rubbed with chipotle flavored seasoning, and red and green chile sauce?  Uhh- mazing.  And not as expensive as a steak at STK or the like.  I had some awesome spicy collard greens with it as well, which required me to devour that delicious jalapeno cornbread that came with it.

All in all?  Try this place.  It's not crazy expensive, but it is crazy good.
