spvjNOYeR7sFX6yTgP21og I love this place! They have an extensive selection for vegans, and their food is as close to authentic as Mexican food in Toronto gets. They also have vegan fried ice cream, and it is SOOOOOO good! I find myself craving it more often than I would like! The service is also VERY friendly! On one occasion that my boyfriend and I went, the server had overheard that my boyfriend really wanted to try cactus, and the server came back with some cactus for him to try free of charge! The only reason I am not giving them a 5/5 is a very finicky one. I have a strong sensitivity to bell peppers, which makes eating Mexican food rather difficult. On busy days, Rancho Relaxo pre-prepares their food mixtures, which means there are not many options for me. If I go on less busy days they are very accommodating and will make my order without bell peppers. I almost feel guilty giving them a 4/5 because I know how great they are, but a 5/5 needs to go to a place that I think it perfect!  If you like Mexican food, you should check this place out. If you are vegan/vegetarian, then you definitely need to give them a try!!!
