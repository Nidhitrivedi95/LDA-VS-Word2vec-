TQPxHfKykLLG6echeHru-g Very basic mediocre quality of Mexican food,  I lived in Los Angeles for 17 years with amount of Mexican population in Los Angeles you find the best  Mexican restaurants out of Mexico , I've eaten some of the best Mexican restaurants  and also the food trucks who sells Mexican food in Los angels, so  when I visited EL REY DEL TACOS past weekend obviously I started to compare the food with the one iam use to having in Los Angeles well I was making a big mistake i should not compare because the food I had at REY DEL TACOS was very bad, it has no taste at all specially the burritos It was swimming in the sauce it was so soggy and the quality of the meat they use was very very bad , tacos was okey I mean just okey we did not enjoy it at all we won't go back. But this is just us  if you are not use to having  original good quality Mexican food this restaurant will do the job after all this is MONTREAL where you will find minimum amount of Mexicans not many Mexican restaurants .
