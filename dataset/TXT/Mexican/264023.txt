Wbi-x-1Nbn6LFCMOSN6F5Q I am visiting from out of town and thought I would give it a try, especially since there was a long line. Their food and service had to good!  I always look to try new food when I go out of town. I was so wrong with this place. The line moved at an okay pace, considering their menu appeared to be fairly simple. However, their menu boasts various items with fish. So I thought I would give one a try. I was forewarned that there was a 15 min wait on the fish.  I accepted the wait and proceeded with my order. I saw the fish on the grill and thought it couldnt be that bad and I didn't hear anyone before me order fish.  Well that 15 min wait turned into 30!!!! I asked them 5 times about my order each time I got an "it's coming" or "5 mins" or "2 more mins"   All the while,
 I am watching them process other orders and barely able to keep those straight. A relative who was with me asked for some sort of compensation for the wait. An employee offered a free drink, but never gave us the cup. Finally just as I decided to ask for a refund, my order came through. The cashier told me he put an extra vinaigrette for my salad to compensate me for the wait....REALLY?!?!  GEE THANKS!!!! Needless to say, I won't be coming back.....I did give it 2 stars. In spite of the wait my food still looked good (I am all about presentation) but taste wise  it wasn't anything to get excited about.  If you must go, I STRONGLY suggest you call your order in and take it to go especially if you are pressed for time.
