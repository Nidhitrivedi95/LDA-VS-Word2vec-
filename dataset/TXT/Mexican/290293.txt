Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ This is the second breakfast I've had here.  The first time, i sat inside and it was very nice.  This time, we sat out on the balcony and it was marvelous.   The duck and hash were delicious.  The duck confit was on top of a pastry puff and the egg was perfect.   The grapefruit sections were sparce but good.  Their fresh juices are delicious.  I think it was a pear ginger or something i cant seem to remember. 

The avacado salad was just ok.  It probably wont stay on the menu for long.  It gets crowded for breakfast so make reservations!
