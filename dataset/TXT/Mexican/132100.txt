ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA Sorry, this was way too expensive for what you got. Our waitress was also a bit misleading when we asked her about the size of the tacos(we asked because we'd been to a place the day before that served happy meal size tacos for way too much.)-she said they were big and filling. I'm now wondering if she said that tongue in cheek cause they were tiny and looked like appetizers. 

And what's the deal with rice and beans that everybody spoons off from a communal plate, for chrissakes gimme my own plate and make it look appetizing instead of a goopy mess in the middle of everyone. 

My friend got a no frills burrito for $14(nothing else) and a $8 margarita , and also felt ripped off.

I gave it two stars because the hostesses were fun to talk to and the 2 mini seabass tacos I had ($13 with nothing else) were actually amazing. Still wouldn't go back or really recommend the place. Too bad the prices and portions were a joke.
