The only downside is that they had us sit on the outside patio even though I wanted a indoor table. Claiming it would be a 25 minute wait although there were plenty of open indoor seats. Also they forgot to bring out my guacamole appetizer. The waiter comped me for it but it would've been nice to have with my fish tacos.
