rtT7RqERpHbRYOiTIgGszQ This is the second Fausto's location we've been to and decided to grab a bite after checking out Castaways Resale Store a few doors down.

The menu is the same as other locations so I ordered one of my favorites, their  Chile Relleno Burrito and we also tried a bowl of Menudo.

The burrito was pretty good, but their menudo is much greasier here than their other locations. A-OK for me, but in no such hurry to return. ALOHA!!!
