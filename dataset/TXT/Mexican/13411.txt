0jAexNHRHhkQv4zNYqenBA Brought a party of 4 here for lunch but we never made it in the door . I was wearing camo and our party was rejected by the bouncer at the front door . We were told that camo is not welcome into this establishment. Just want to give our soldiers who protect our country that you are not welcome here . It's a shame that el hefe welcomes drunken frat boys over our military.
