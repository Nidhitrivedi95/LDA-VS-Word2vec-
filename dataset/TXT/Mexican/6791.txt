The smothered burrito, I had once, and it's quite the experience, like a Mexian calzone I guess.  Otherwise, the regular burrito with chicken or chorizo meat is also good.  I trust the shrimp would be good too.

The side order of guacamole and chips, washed down with an ice cold beer is never a bad thing.
