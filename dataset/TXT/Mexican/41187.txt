6XpqswYWoSOx0a9MkosVRA This was my family's second visit to this restaurant.  I was disappointed the first time with the service.  When we walked in we could see the severs arguing over who got which stations.  Once we were seated I overheard one server(a male) discussing his problems with his girlfriend while the other server rolled up silverware. The food was good the first visit but they had run out of the albondiga soup. The second visit they were out of kids menus( which is strange) and the server took a while to get our orders and our drinks.  Once we did order out of our party of 6 only 5 received their meals.  We had to ask 3 times for utensils.  Our server this time was running around frantically and you could tell she was very overwhelmed.  The food this time was fair it was very salty. I don't think I will be back or recommend it to anyone.
Hopefully they will get their act together because it's a cute space.
