hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg I went here with my girlfriend (now fiancee) this past Thursday for a celebratory dinner, and couldn't have had a better experience. As an avid fan of Chuck Hughes cooking, I was hoping not to be disappointed but everything from the food, to the service, to the ambience were great.  Couple things I would be sure to try, Jerk Snow Crab legs, Braised Short Rib, Lobster Risotto, and Goat cheese with lentils. Next time I'm in Montreal Ill be sure to return.
