jKndHanZV4fygbNHWK5Xnw A LOT of food and prices are comparable to Filiberto's across the street.  However, the quality is much better.  Tacos, burritos, super nachos... anything "al pastor" is flavorful and definitely worth a try!  The chicken that they use definitely has a kick- just the right amount of heat that will leave your mouth tingling for a bit. Minus one star for their carne asada which I found to be lacking in flavor.  Otherwise, everything is fantastic!
