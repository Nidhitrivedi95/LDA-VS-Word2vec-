rANNcpPvv9EezHF-6kYCMg Cool little spot in my neck of the woods. Finally a place close by representing the local vibe I always have to go closer to Charlotte to get. The owner and Chef Aaron is delivering excellent small plates with varying tastes. And by the way, he beat Bobby Flay on Bobby's tv show. First, the strawberry habanero rita is awesome with just the right punch. There is also a nice selection of local beers and an array of wines by the glass and bottle. We had a couple of Rita's and then a nice glass of wine. Outdoor patio is nice but be ready for direct sun until after 730. The server Sidney was attentive yet not bothersome. She made suggestions on menu options and drink selections.  She even got the chef to come out to the table so we could "beg" for some chips from the daily fish taco option. They were house made salt n vinegar chips. Delicious!!  There are an a sundry of taco and small plate options. 
Definitely recommend and will be back in the future. I hear he is going to be changing up the menu in a few weeks.
