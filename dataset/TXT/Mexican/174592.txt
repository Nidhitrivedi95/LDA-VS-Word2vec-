MmU8ak-uG-s1RbqXu13m0Q If I could give lower than one star, I would. We came here during the beginning of the week... The service was extremely slow, although there wasn't that many people inside the restaurant. Their drinks don't even seem to have one ounce of alcohol in them. We had to request double shots, which we repeated to our waiter 3 times and it only came 20-25 minutes later. Their food was bland in taste. We all ordered something different and yet all of our dishes were subpar. Beef tacos, chimichangas, enchiladas and a buffet plater and two out of us got a stomach bug afterwards that lasted a couple of days. I do not recommend at all.
