qlyYPDt9xk03K-MGd95puw I been to this place several times. Every time I been there the food has been good for a fast food place. The first time I went there I was surprise of amount of food you get. So far the only problem I have had is the lack of communications when I ordered my food. I though I was ordering a few items but I ended up getting a meal. It was OK with me I was hungry. Live and learn when you go to a new place.
