cRMC2eQ9CP6ivhEY8EdaGg Ok so i have been dying to try this restaurant for the longest time since having tried Burrito Boyz and Fat Bastards colleague of mine that lived downtown told me about it and mentioned if i was downtown worth checking it out.

So weekday dinner time hungry and in the mood for Burritos told the wife about it and she was excited to try it as well. 

Set off down Church street looking for Chinos Locos ended walking from Bloor all the way down to College could not find the place. Decided to call the restaurant told we are at Church/Maitland by the way staff were very rude and unhelpful with directions.  

Proceeded again to walk up and down searching for this place used both sides of the streets could not find it hmmpf!!! I thought i was going insane turned on the GPS on the cell literally went around in another circle until I saw the SIGN!!! BEWARE the restaurant is ontop of a pub and you have to look for a sign that has a white background with faintly colored yellow and orange writing on it!!!


So we go up the stairs to the restaurant and were informed that they were closing in 10 mins and it was take out only. Explained that i was the person that called and if they had told me the restaurant is ontop of a pub and given me the name of the place i would have been there half an hour earlier. Still the staff person was not interested insisted take out only. Thought about it but seeing the price of the burritos is already not cheap getting in home and eating a soggy tortilla did not seem appetizing.

ADVICE - Treat your potential customers better exceptions could have been made i did not plan on spending all night eating my wrap also when giving directions be clear as possible after all you do want customers to find your restaurant.

The restaurant itself did not look appealing inside and honestly i do not want to go back although i heard good things. Will continue getting my Burrito fix elsewhere.
