q50PTYB15EO2jEwgv-9vrA NOT LGBTQ FRIENDLY!!!   
Sadly, I can't talk about the food or the drinks here because our server said "hola señoas" as he approached the table my boyfriend and I were occupying to take our order.   I asked him: "you mean señores?"  And he said yeah, yeah with a chuckle. So we left.  

We can say that the salsa tastes jarred not fresh. 

Thanks "Si, Señor ( ironic) for the worst service ever in the fastest way.
