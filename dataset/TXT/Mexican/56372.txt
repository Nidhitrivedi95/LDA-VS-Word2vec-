a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg Loved this place! We flew to Vegas for a 2 day trip last month and managed to eat here twice. The food was delicious and the staff was very welcoming. The prices weren't bad at all and the customer service was on point. I would recommend this place for sure. I plan on going again when we head back to Vegas in December
