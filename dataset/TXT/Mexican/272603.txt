WUswpeAjbiww_xkSS8jTEA You know that the place is going to be amazing when they serve you complimentary freshly made, hot tortilla chips! I absolutely recommend their (#1) salvadorian plate! All the side dishes compliment each other. I also loved their chicken tamale and bean and cheese pupusas. It was full of flavor in each bite! It was a lot of food so I ended up taking some home to eat it later. Our food came quickly. Highly recommend it and will be back to try more food!
