WGkqfp1-3130v8xhCb3APg I definitely have to decrease my rating from 4 down to 2 stars. On our last visit the place wasn't very clean. They also left the door open and we were harassed by flies the entire time. Also the food has also gotten very bland and could use some refining (e.g. the steak chunks in a burrito are too big).

My girlfriend had a coupon for a "baby burrito" (because they screwed up an order on another date), but when they brought that out it was way burnt! She had to send it back, and by the time she got yet another, I had finished all of my food. We were sick of the flies and left after that.

Tontos just isn't keeping up when there are plenty of great Mexican options in Lakewood with better food and a better beer selection. Go to Barrio, Barroco, or Cozumel instead.
