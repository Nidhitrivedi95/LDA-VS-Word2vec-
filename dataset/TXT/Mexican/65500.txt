How ever a week later I came back a couple times and I saw them doing a method where they have carne asada already cooked and being kept warm in a metal jar over the grill with tongs in it. I guess they do this so that they don't have to keep cooking a fresh batch of meat every time they get an order but it's horrible. And it doesn't make any sense because carne asada only takes 3 minutes to cook. I got my food and the meat was barely warm and tasted stale and hard. This is coming from someone who ate Roberto's growing up in Vegas. Lazy method by lazy employees. I asked them to re make my order and make me fresh meat and they did. Just upset they had to turn to bad habits so quickly.
