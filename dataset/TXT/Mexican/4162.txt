-QKKkUEQhDVndxZDT9SovQ Best Mexican food in the Fort Mill/Tega Cay area. The place is super clean and the wait staff is awesome. The menu is great, I just wish they had tortas. The salsa seemed fresh and the chips are not overly salted like charanda. I would ask for Malicio for a waiter....he is great. It's the only place I'll go for Mexican near the house.
