AhPmh0NaRDbEYyhd9egzLA Nice hip ambiance, and service was fine, but the food left much to be desired. The house Margarita is unusually sweet and somewhat odd tasting, possibly from the triple sec they add. I ordered the carne asada tacos and the beef was tough with sinew and gristle. The food is expensive for the quality.
