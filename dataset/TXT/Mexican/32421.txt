4mb32UmQULqg7IMck28vog Today was the third time visiting this location, and I will not be back again. The first time I had the tacos and they were ok. Second time, the burrito, which was very bland. Today I ordered the carne asada salad and the chicken tortilla soup. The salad was a joke, soggy shredded lettuce with no flavor, same as the chewy carne asada. The tortilla soup was very sweet and dense, tasted like a curry soup. It was terrible! This place is overpriced, overhyped, and some of the guys working there are plain rude. I'd prefer Taco Bell over this place.
