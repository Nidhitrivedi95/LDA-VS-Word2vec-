57aBx6Mo_VRk_kMA8J5Efg I have been coming here since they opened and I cannot find anything wrong with them. I cannot understand why some people want to throw them under the bus when they have only been there once or twice. They may not be the best in the country but they are the best in this part of the country. Why are you eating at this place, find you didnt like it then head to another Mexican restaurant? Doesnt make sense unless you eat like a sumo wrestler? Why cant you just say you didnt like the place and the reason and leave it at that? You just have to go the extra mile and muddy it up dont ya? Look at the high marks - it speaks for itself people. 1 or two sourpusses just shows the rest of us were glad La Unica is a success!
