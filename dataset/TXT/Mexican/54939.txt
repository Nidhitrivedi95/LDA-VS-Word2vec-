9vub2LM7Djy8P-LPumcLXA Was looking for a quick spot for food after traveling from the airport and this was perfect! The woman and man who worked there were so sweet and made conversation with us and genuinely hoped we liked the food - we definitely did! Quick, friendly and delicious. All of it tasted crazy authentic. They are pending a liquor license in June so once that happens it'll be even better ;)
