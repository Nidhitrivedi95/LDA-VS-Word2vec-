nwHd2MbIGz0SNG8GpFjekw Always a favorite. Everything seems fresh and made to order. Always greeted with a smile and the happy hour specials are worth planning for.  

In addition to the street tacos, burritos and quesadillas are really good. 

Has an outside patio for when the weather is right. Awesome street tacos and homemade pico!
