zCmwErM82hdKl4L2UixDJw For casual tacos and a good drink, head to Barrio in Lakewood. The food is fresh but the service model is a step away from Chipotle. I hated the process for "build your own." Very confusing but maybe because it wasn't explained to us. The server was aloof if not "put out" by us being in her section. Again, don't go for the typical restaurant experience; go for the novelty.
