4PqqRa7o_eNydKdGWYdIog YHE BEST fish taco I have had in my life.  I got the fried fish taco.  It came with mayo on it and I hate mayo, but the fish was so good I had to eat it anyhow!  They smoke their own meats and my fiancé and roommate got their smoked chicken and al pastor tacos for the taco Tuesday special.  They said both were delicious.  I tried the al pastor and found it yummy as well.  I also tried the chorizo taco, but it wasn't anything special.  The guy who served us (I think he is the owner) was super friendly, helpful, and attentive.  This place has BYOB and there is a drive through (kinda sketchy) liquor store next door.  The taco Tuesday special was for 3 street tacos, and it only ran my fiancé just over $4.00!  The chips are made to order and my fiancé who isn't a big chip person couldn't stop eating them!  I can't wait to go back and try the carne asada and fried shrimp tacos that many others have praised in their reviews!  Definitely check this place out!
