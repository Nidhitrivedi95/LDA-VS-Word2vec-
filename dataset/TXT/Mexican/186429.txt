nYpxA8exNB1VPuM7XYS7fg Oh.my.yum. Went to El Chino over the weekend during my visit to Phoenix-- and I can't get these tacos off my mind! My fiancé and I visited from Portland and this was pretty much the best part of our trip. He's from Cali and I'm originally from Phoenix, let's just say we crave good Mexican food when we come to town and El Chino nailed it. I think together with my parents, we ordered five different tacos and they were all amazing. The consensus was that the carne asada was the favorite. The tacos were a lot bigger than we expected, but that was the best part about them. They aren't anywhere near those dinky street tacos-- so come hungry and ready to eat!

If we could pack up the restaurant and take it with us, we totally would. Open a location in Portland, please!
