fDiyDg1pUetf9dMLFJ6oXw OMG. Been seeing the ads for the "Naked Chicken Chalupa." Wanted to try it. I haven't been to Taco Bell in a decade or more. Walked in on Saturday at 5:30 and there was a line of 8 or so, but I expected that. Unfortunately, as soon as I got past the door I was overcome with an overwhelming stench of raw sewer gas. Something obviously was working its way the wrong direction in the plumbing. I actually started to feel nauseous. Quickly calculated that the amount of time in line I would have to intake this noxious, putrid odor would poison me faster than the food would. Quickly exited. Maricopa County Health Department...Hey, when you have a chance, maybe you could wear some HazMat gear and check it out? Thanks.
