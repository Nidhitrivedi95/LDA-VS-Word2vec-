OTcBXjDkViDPds4Lxy8KIQ Have you been here before?  Everyone needs to be familiar with this place. The cuisine of New Mexico has its own charm and deliciousness and the margaritas are amazing. The staff is conscientious and friendly.  And, having moved to this new location, theres plenty of elbow room (including outside seating). I highly recommend it.
