IfdwBSEuDK3fKvVHVX9k0A Veganized the 3 bean nacho dip & loved it. Very unique dip. Loved the seasoning. Was the size of a whole meal in my opinion. Ran out of pita bread & was brought more at no charge. Fresh cut fries were amazing! Bean burger arrived & was much larger than expected! Love that! Took it home! Excellent friendly service. Would definately recommend this restaurant to friends!
