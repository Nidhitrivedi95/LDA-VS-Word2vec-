2sjfncn3GNHpKZDAcsm1Uw in a gas station, YES A GAS STATION!  I honestly can say I had my doubts. So being the optimistic kind of guy that I am, I gave it a soft try. "1 shrimp cocktail to go please." And man o man am I impressed.  Only 10$ for it. Was really good.. nextime ima try the food..  I was surprised.. I will return 4sure....

 I have returned. It is Really good. Hard to believe my new favorite taquira is in a gas station. Ordered a wet burrito which came with rice and beans.. DELICIOUS!  My girl had the sopes. Those were on hit too. I'm impressed with this place and the prices are reasonable.  And yes I get the shrimp cocktail every time. So good on a hot day. It was loaded with shrimp.. love this place. A true hidden gem

Ps. I should have posted pics of my food. But I ate that shit!!
