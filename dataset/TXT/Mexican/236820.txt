sW3oXGgDbbOC3YkiFKZNMQ My girlfriend and I went through the line and it was apparent that the employees were not listening to us at all. Her bowl was remade twice and both times it was remade incorrectly. I felt as if I had to yell over the counter for them to hear me. On the last attempt of remaking her bowl, they again messed it up. We walked out and went to the Chipotle off of 83rd ave and Bell. If it wasn't for Dennis being an awesome guy (the GM) I would have rated only one star. We won't be back.

**edit
I've visited this location a few times due to it being convenient for me. Things have improved and the customer service and food quality has improved immensely. Staff is very friendly and polite. The reason I gave 4 stars rather than 5 was due to my previous post, wouldn't be fair to throw a 5
