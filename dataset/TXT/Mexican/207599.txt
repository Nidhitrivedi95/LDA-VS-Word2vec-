QaMb5uqUmC4Zm4aNVzM8kQ I'm being nice giving it 2 stars - I expect in Scottsdale the food should be somewhat decent. Nope!

I've been in a couple of times never impressed; however, the last time I was in the food was one of the worst food I've had in a long time. The environment/decor boring.  The food I could not even eat (chorizo tacos) grease was pouring out of the taco, the only good food was the chips and salsa.  The rice/beans as a side had no flavor and were presented in a tacky dish with both together (you are in scottsdale). 

Maybe it was my experience but I'm shocked there are any reviews that are 4 star or better.
