iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg I dream about these tacos all the time! Tucked in the heart of kensington market. If you do not go early, expect a line up! Their tacos are huge. Definitely two will fill you up. Their baja fish is really good and their spicy shrimp is also reaally really good. Definitely also pick up their watermelon juice as well.

They also have a small salsa selection (from mild to extra hot) at the pick up. I believe their salsas are home made and they taste really good!
