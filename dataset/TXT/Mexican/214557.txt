QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA No Joke, best mexican restaurant I've been to in a very long time. 
I'm so glad I found this place on Yelp.

My cousin and I came here not knowing what to expect.  We were blown away at how good the food was!  

We both got nachos and the signature tacos plate, phenomenal!!!!  

I can't wait to go back to Vegas just so I can visit Nacho Daddy again,  I liked it better than the Baccanal Buffett in Caesars!  Much more affordable too.  Check this place out!
