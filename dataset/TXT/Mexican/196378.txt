oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ Hostess was a little snotty about my service animal but Management cleared that up .    The happy hour has good prices I just wish it was also downstairs.  The service could've been a little better in fact my friends just said a whole lot better as they hear me talking to text for text.   I love fajitas they were so tasty.   The food was a 5 the service was at 2 super had a lot of tattoos and a  man bun but I can't remember his name.   The manager Emily I think that was her name was nice. So we gave 4 star rating I would go back that's the bottom line.   It was all three of our first times here and all three of us live here on the strip.
