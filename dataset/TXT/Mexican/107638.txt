frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A Oh Food Network, how you have let me down. Honestly, I should have known better because Guy Fieri seems to always think everything that goes into his mouth in his show Diners Drive-Ins and Dives is "dynamite." Seriously, I mean, has he ever said anything negative? I've been to many restaurants he had endorsed on his show and have generally been disappointed... La Santisima would be on that list as well. I can't just blame Guy though, because Yelp also has raving reviews for it. Perculiar...

I came here an hour before closing time on a Wednesday. No wait. We were given a complimentary basket of freshly fried tortilla chips. I was impressed when I was told by the waitress of their selection of 18 sauces at the sauce station. Who doesn't love sauce?! Unfortunately I tried nearly half of them and none of them really stood out. For my meal, I decided to order the tacos since that is what they are known for. I got three a la carte gourmet tacos which were $3.99 a piece: pacific white fish taco, aztec tinga taco, and el gaucho taco. They all tasted just okay which was a disappointment because from all the reviews I was expecting some sort of out-of-body experience when, in fact, I've had way better tacos just about everywhere else. I had a taste of my husband's chicken quesadilla (I think the La Santisima Specialities Quesa) which I thought was actually better than the tacos. Still not awesome, but better. The crust was thick which is unlike any quesadillas I've had before. The quesadilla comes in a rather large portion and is very hearty. 

Overall, this place is definitely overhyped. I rather have Taco Bell.
