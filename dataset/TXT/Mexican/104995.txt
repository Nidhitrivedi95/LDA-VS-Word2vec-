FI-8LPGkc8D_hwx0l0zyyg Love the atmosphere and service at Blanco, and the food even more!  We had a very fun evening here. 

Take advantage of Happy Hour if you can!  Half price on their crisps (delicious) and starters and house margaritas (all the margaritas on the menu are eliglble). What a great deal! 

We loved the chipotle shrimp and corn, braised short rib and avocado and cheese and guacamole crisps. 

After consuming a fair amount of chips and salsa and all the crisps we hardly had room for our entrees so we split a few things. One was chicken fajitas which my sister claimed were the best fajitas she had ever had in her life. They mix all the "toppings" together with the meat instead of having you add your own ingredients to it. She really liked that. My husband and I shared the Machaca Beef Tacos (braised short rib, green peppers, onions). I loved the short rib flatbread and the tacos also did not disappoint. Yum!! 

We also had very good service here!
