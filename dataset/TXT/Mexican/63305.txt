aYE-oZFvSOHsyAtcpf0frQ I couldn't be more in love with a Mexican restaurant. If the hole in the wall feel doesn't get you first it's the deliciousness of their food. 

I haven't had food, service, prices, etc. this good since I lived in Chicago and had gone to college in Platteville. 

The salsa is fresh and has the prefect balance of ingredients nothing like the blandness that I've had in most places around Madison. The fajitas are to die for and they actually give you a good portion of meat with your money. The guacamole also has my heart, it's fresh and also balances it's ingredients well. Horchata is even YUM! 

You actually get what you pay for here and that's important to me. Large portions that will leave you so full that they need to roll you out the door like Violet in Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. 

Yes, the place is small, but who cares I love the intimate atmosphere and it makes it easier for the wait staff to see who needs to be served next or wants refills. Who knows, maybe they'll be successful enough one day to open a bigger location. 

Considering I have been trying to find a Mexican restaurant that I can't wait to go visit again for five years it's safe to say that I'm an extremely satisfied.
