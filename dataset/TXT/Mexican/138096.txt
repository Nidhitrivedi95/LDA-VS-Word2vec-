If I had the lazarus pit from season 3&4 from Arrow that made you live forever, I would probably just come here a lot. It's is as if God himself is making the burrito and the burrito is Christ himself. When I take the first bite I cry. I cry because a wave of emotions crashes down upon me with the force of 1000 waves. And I am happy. I AM GOD. so all in all the food is pretty epic af.
