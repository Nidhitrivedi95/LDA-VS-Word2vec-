nUfeYJ_YEaDzggPKnYry3g I'm not sure why Yelp wont let me update my past review, but that's on them. Since my review of the dining room, K and I have been to happy hour 4 times. I wanted to toss out some Kudos to Andrew who served us on two of those occasions. Andrew is a good server. The challenge you'll find at Tia Rosa is that they also give servers tables in the dining room as well as the bar. Service is S L O W. Just how it is. The margaritas are very good, the happy hour menu has some incredible deals and if you get the beef nachos ($6.00), there will be enough beef on the nachos to take half off, order a cheese crisp ($3.00) and make a beef quesadilla out of it. I mean the amount of beef is amazing. On the negative side however, is that the nachos tend to end up a bit wet. Very few if any crispy chips. While at happy hour we've had the $1 tacos in both beef and pork renditions. I mean for a buck, seriously. What a deal. We've also had the cheese crisp and beef rolled tacos ($3.50). Really everything on the happy hour menu is a great deal.
The negatives are the soggy nachos, the charge for chips & salsa during h.h., slow service and the hours that happy hour runs. Ending at 6 is fairly common but 5 on a Friday. Who the hell's going to be happy about that? 
Slow Service. Some very good Staff. Great Happy Hour. Good Food. 4 Stars.
