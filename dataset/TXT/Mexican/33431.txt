4SyAKQevPuB4punANp41-Q Three of us went last night and had a really good time. I had just finished reading a book on tequila and mezcal, so was very interested in trying these impossible to get mezcals. It was fascinating and the bartender, Julian, was very knowledgeable. Yes, the mezcals are pricey, but it's worth it. And the torta I had was excellent.
