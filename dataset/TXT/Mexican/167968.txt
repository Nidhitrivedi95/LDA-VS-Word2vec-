lv5Bnqlt93NnvNJ2oNcQ8Q Food is just OK - not the best for a sit down Mexican restaurant and honestly pretty overpriced given the quality and area (it's not like it's near the Strip). I didn't see a carne asada plate on the menu so asked the waitress who suggested I get a beef fajita plate. Instead of carne asada, it was seasoned ground beef (like hamburger meat) cut into strips. Tortillas were homemade and good, rice and chips, etc. good but it was $18 for that meal. Also tried cheese enchiladas another time which were just OK. Flaming Fajita is a lot better.
