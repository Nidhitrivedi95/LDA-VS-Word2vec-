G7LYpILnHveyvbg3sJePPw We had the maple glazed onion rings (super yummy), beet and goat cheese salad (surprisingly flavourful), and the "constructeur" burger (meat was over-processed, but otherwise good). The standout here was the service. Our waitress was attentive, polite, and very quick. 

And if you don't know - everything on the menu is $4.95. Everything. It's a super sweet deal, and the place has a lot of charm. We'll definitely be back.

Edit- you've just lost a star: Came back with a friend for drinks... Definitely not as good as last time. Minimal glaze on the onion rings, the potato skins had sparse toppings, and the hard shell of the tacos were STALE. We let our server know... and she did not offer to get us something else and we were still charged for bad food. Not impressed. Worth a third try? We'll see. I was not super happy that they didn't get our wine order right either.
