_XN-GwzZwAyIqLKJsl2htg This place is weird, not in a cool way. Although I liked the decor I just don't understand why there are so many people in here. 

 I wasn't a fan of the food, the ramen tasted like an instant ramen packet, then everything else we had was sickly sweet. The sweet and savory thing is nice here and there but not every plate. True asian cuisine is immensely savory, the food here was all covered in either hoisin or brown sugar from the taste of it. 

 My server was nice but I won't be coming back, didn't enjoy it.
