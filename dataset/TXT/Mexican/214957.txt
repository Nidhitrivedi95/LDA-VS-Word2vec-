qxVcSWGKyH3HkkHV8NinDA I used to visit saltys back in the day when it first opened. Not the best quality food but it was the place to be. The past few years I always suggest going there for a good patio spot but not a place to get good service or food, until today. We had a great bartender named Ben. He made our drinks exactly how we asked and didn't shrug at our sorta demanding needs. He even took our picture to help celebrate our day off! Even more surprising they have a lunch special where you can choose a starter, an entree, 2 sides (sorta like a bento box) It was actually really really good. And it was only $8!!! I would def recommend that to somebody who wants a healthier easy and delicious meal in old town. With a great view and patio! Thanks for changing my option salty seniorita!!!
