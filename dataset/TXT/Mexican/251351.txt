umxN12ok_qOB4qru0qmx6g Yes, it's a taco del mar. You may have preconceived notions about what that means. I did too.

Then I came here, and realised that regardless of whether there's a jays game or not, I can actually get seated on a patio, get a pretty damn good pork burrito and two beers. 

Will it get 3 stars in Toronto Life? Nope.

But are RSBG, SoCo, Aria and others in the area 5 times as good to match their price premium? Not any time I've been there.

Take it from a neighbourhood resident, if you're looking for a quick bite on a patio and a couple cold beers, this is the best deal you will ever find down here.
