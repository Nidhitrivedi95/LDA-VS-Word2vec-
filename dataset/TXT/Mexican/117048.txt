gOBxVkHpqtjRRxHBIrpnMA After hearing a lot about Chipotle and their version of a healthy burrito, my husband and I finally decided to try it.
I am happy to report that we were not disappointed. 
We shared a chicken burrito with medium hot salsa and chips on the side.
This was certainly the most healthy tasting burrito I have ever tried. 
I actually didn't feel guilty at all for eating it. lol
The chips were nice too. You can taste that they make them fresh every day.

We'll certainly come back some time when we get the chance.
