dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA I decided to come to Phat Phrank's based on their high star rating and was disappointed. I gave this place 3 stars because I can't give it 2.5 The food was decent, but their service and their prices were not great. I ordered the Taco Combo which was $7.99 (not bad); I got the adobada and carne asada. The tacos were good, their salsa was good, but the rice and beans were pretty mediocre. The rice looked fluffy, but there were a few undercooked, crunchy grains. The beans tasted a little like they were from a can. I also ordered their chips and guacamole, which were pretty good, but not worth $5. I also got a large horchata for almost $3, which would've been okay if it didn't taste like the powdered stuff you get from the Latin market. Lastly, the lady who took my order was NOT friendly at all. She seemed like she was annoyed and like she didn't want to be there. For the tacos, she asked if I wanted mild, medium, or hot salsa, but she didn't elaborate on what types (red or green), and I totally didn't feel welcomed to ask. I wasn't greeted, thanked, or asked anything other than what I was ordering and that was because I walked up to the counter.
All in all, the food was not bad; I'd eat their tacos again. Their decor was pretty cool too. However, my lunch experience was NOT worth the $20 I spent.
