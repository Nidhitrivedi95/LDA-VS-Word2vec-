GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog Was excited to give this spot a shot. Between 5 people I felt like we tried one of what felt like every category. The tuna ceviche was good and probably a favorite, although not mind blowing, 3 different types of tacos, the 20 vegetable fried rice, pork and vegetable dumplings, and the mango agua Fresca (seasonal).

Tuna was good, most of everything else, sad to say, left me feeling like the dishes were bland and missing that umph factor. The agua Fresca was great.

Give it a try, nice restaurant in a nice hotel, but was hoping for something great and left feeling unfortunately disappointed.
