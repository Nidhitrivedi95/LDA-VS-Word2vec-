knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw I like fun more than being a foodie, so this place has always been a good time.  They have  small patio that is perfect E4th people watching PLUS I've always had good service (and the older I get the more picky I am with service).  The empanadas were pretty much fried perfection, so that was a good snack and provided a good base for the festivities that lied ahead.

I'm a fan and will be back.  I probably won't take my out of town friends here, but I'll come back.
