JECKrOvqJ_faoW_QxyeEAw This place is a joke.. only one other  table in the whole place that should have been the first sign. Ordered nachos that took way to long to make and still came out with burnt meat and chips and cold not melted cheese. So we decided to cancel our "street tacos" which they brought out anyway and they had so much sauce we couldn't even see the meat. Sent it ALL back and blew that taco stand. Taco bell is more Mexican then The Boss.. Gross
