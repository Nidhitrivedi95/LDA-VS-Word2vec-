UUfioP3G4Qowm0x2HQlPtA Food was great, I especially like the chicken which I found quite delicious when paired with their "hot head" sauce.  Not sure where the few negative reviews are coming from as I found the food at Hot Head Burritos to be a lot better than that at Chipotle (and I have been a big Chipotle fan for many years.  Service was good but it is clear they are new and still working some of the kinks out.  I will definitly be back and look forward to trying all of the various sauces they have available.
