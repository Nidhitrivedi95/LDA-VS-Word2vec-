B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA Seriously, whoever created this concept is a GENIUS!  Who would've thunk!

Twin Dragon all the way!  I liked that the shrimp tempura in it was not soggy at all and everything in it tasted very fresh. Customer service was A++! Very nice, friendly, and helpful. 

I admit, the price runs on the higher side, but I think it's completely worth it! Definitely recommended!
