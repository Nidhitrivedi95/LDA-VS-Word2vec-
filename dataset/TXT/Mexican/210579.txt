qnn9E-e9orYf_wK37yLTYw This was our first time here and I was craving some delicious Mexican food! 
The reason for the three stars is twofold. One, because as soon as we walked in we were not greeted by the hostess. We came in on a Sunday evening and it was really slow. When she sat us down she did not engage in any conversation or even look at us. She was actually looking at the other hostess and having a conversation from a distance. She was completely rude. Second, the rice wasn't good at all. 
Our server was very nice and attentive so she made up for the first impression we got when coming in. We order the queso blanco to start which is only $3 and delicious! I definitely recommend the queso. The chips and salsa were also delicious! For food, I ordered the grilled shrimp, fried shrimp, and Baja chicken. Both of the shrimp tacos were amazinggg! The Baja chicken was just okay, I've had better at a taco truck. The charro beans were also pretty good and as I said earlier the rice was mediocre. 
When we were leaving the hostesses we're still talking to each other and as we were already out the door she said to have a good night. But she already left a bad taste in my mouth, so I didn't even acknowledge her. 
This restaurant has a nice ambience and is very clean. For my first impression it was okay and the food was pretty good, but I don't think I'd made the 30 minute or the way drive again. I would come back if it was convenient.
