O_UC_izJXcAmkm6HlEyGSA Went today for lunch and service was very slow despite there only being 3 tables seated in the entire place. Food is passable but there are better Mexican places in Toronto. Fish tacos were bland and Mexican corn was most just hot and not very flavorful. Chorizo burrito with egg on top was better but un memorable.
