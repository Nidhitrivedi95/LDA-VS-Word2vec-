frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A what a disappointment! i've had this place bookmarked for a looooong time, so i was excited when i finally convinced a large group of my friends to dine here.

the salsa bar did not disappoint, so i had higher expectations for the food. my fave salsas were the peanut, the mexicana, and the pibil something or other. the strawberry one tasted like... crushed strawberries. surprise? 

i had the 2 taco plate (~$10).... i had one la condesa special w/ shrimp (spinach, cheese, onions, peppers.... other things?) and one chicken mole. the chicken was tasty, and the tacos are pretty decently portioned.... it was a good thing the shrimp was smothered in cheese because it was SUPER overcooked. you get a teeny portion of rice and beans on the side.

husband got a burrito and taco plate (~$13)... the burrito was the much-hyped cochinita pibil, and the taco was the el gaucho (skirt steak w/ avo and chimichurri). eh. the cochinita pibil was ok, but not "melt-in-your-mouth".... and i dunno if beans were the right accompaniment for it. the skirt steak was TOUGH and dry... and there was hardly any chimichurri (if any?) to redeem it.  this combo only comes w/ some calabacitas (squash), no rice.

our table's consensus was that the majority of the meat was dry/overcooked. there was definitely some pleasing flavors, but were made unenjoyable by overcooked, dry meat. 

perhaps it was because we were a large party (9) and it was busy (fri night)... but the service was kinda spotty. they were kind enough to split our bill for us, which was great. it is a very small place, so i wouldn't recommend going in a group larger than 4, maybe 6.

i might be willing to give this place a go again... but for the high prices and based on my lackluster experience, i'm sadly placing la condesa in my "phoenix over-hyped" list.
