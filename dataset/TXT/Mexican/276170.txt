XfUoM-27iPHkbewPXepmFQ El Pollo Loco is some fine fast-food Mexican cuisine. One of my favorite things on earth is the BRC burrito.....beans, rice and cheese. Super simple. I load it up with the green sauce, full of fresh cilantro. 

Some things on the menu can be a bit pricey for drive-thru meals, but it's well worth it.
