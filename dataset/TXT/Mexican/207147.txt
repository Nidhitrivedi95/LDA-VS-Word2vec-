q6igRYs2UTO-4nTwlttrAQ NOT YOUR AUTHENTIC MEXICAN BURRITO :(

POSITIVES
-Hefty portions
-Tortillas made fresh in front of you

AREA FOR IMPROVEMENT
-Rice - a white herbal rice, would really prefer traditional Spanish rice
-Overpriced - almost $10 for a basic bean & cheese burrito w/guac
-They don't know how to roll a burrito & it falls apart
-The tortilla being so thin sticks to the wrapper & falls apart
-Leaky burrito - tortilla too thin & not wrapped tightly
-They do this weird mixing up your filling thing that makes it look like vomit
-No cilantro (!!!?)
-No lettuce
-Flavor is very non-Mexican food, very Americanized
