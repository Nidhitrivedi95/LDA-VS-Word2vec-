XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Chef Bobby Flay's place in Vegas not bad service was outstanding food was good not awesome but then again it is not Bobby Flay cooking it is a Chef he has hired keep your expectations at that level and you will be pleased.

The rating was for the service was a 5 for me and the food a solid 3.5 the Capitol Grill in Jacksonville has a better feel, service, and food.

I recommend it just so you can say I was at Bobby's place but not a regular place to go when I am sure there are MUCH better places like the Eiffel Tower Restaurant , Now this place is Awesome!
