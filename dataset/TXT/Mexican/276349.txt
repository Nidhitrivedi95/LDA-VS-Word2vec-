Xg7Gt8vlSPxSypDQQSVsAA Now that I visited this restaurant a second time, while I wasn't sick, I ordered the DOS EQUIS FISH TACOS and they were fantastic, fresh, light, and delicious. My children smoked their kids menu enchiladas and chicken strips. My tacos were even just as good when I ate it 2 days later, but transferred it onto a different flour tortilla. Just toast the fish in the oven and done!
