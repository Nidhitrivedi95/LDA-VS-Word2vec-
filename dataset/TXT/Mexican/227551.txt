s36Rk0jd78z75LaqifnU3Q This Rey Azteca is as good as most in the West Central Pa area. Quality Mexican food at a decent price. Everything we had was fresh, and delicious. One star loss due to lack of service. Primarily empty restaurant but left siting for about 10 minutes before our order was taken, and just an overall lack of service. Decent food though as normally found at Rey Azteca.
