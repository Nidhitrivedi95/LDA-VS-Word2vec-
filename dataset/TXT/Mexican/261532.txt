vUJhUVmRMn9T4gsmz-L_Yg Based on my order of the green sauced chicken enchiladas served with rice and beans, I give the food a solid 4 stars for the following reasons:  

1) tasty! - well seasoned chicken and green sauce, tortilla was fantastically meaty, served with cotija cheese, avocado and lettuce scattered over the top.  2) quantity - 3 enchiladas! with beans and rice. I took half of it home. 

Service was really great. Friendly, fast, and she checked a few times to make sure we had what we wanted and that it was to our liking. 

Price for the combo plate, a Diet Coke (can), and the tip (20%) came to $13. 

If it's busy, parking could be an issue.  The ambiance inside is clean, comfortable, and pretty.  

If you are used to chunky style salsa, you'll be experiencing a new kind of sauce... Hot sauce, really. Spicy hot sauce.  I hope they add a chunky salsa to their chips and salsa service.
