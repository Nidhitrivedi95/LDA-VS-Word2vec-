BEplfZTUzYwApjMUaOA12w Group Dining Event Review: 

We had a banquet here. We had a party of about 18. It was a bit difficult for me to plan since I'm out of state. I had some issues dealing with some other restaurants and finding a place that worked with our budget. For the event pricing, the prices were reasonable and the food and ambiance matched what we were looking for. 

The event coordinator, Jessica, was great to work with. She was accommodating and very responsive. In our party, we had a child, an infant, and someone with special needs. Jessica and the restaurant staff were accommodating.

We had a special menu that our guests were allowed to pick from at the time of the event. I liked that we were able to do that instead of deciding days/weeks before the event. Our table was along the canal and we were situated a little further from everyone else. It worked out perfectly for us. Everyone at the table enjoyed the chips, salsa, guac, and their menu items. I had the Vaquero Beef Rib. It was excellent! It was tender and the polenta that came with it was great. I also tried the Chile Relleno. It was good. We had a great time and great food - we couldn't be happier with our choice.
