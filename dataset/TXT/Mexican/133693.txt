iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg Location: It's in Kensington market, accessible by streetcar or walking, and is surrounded by many different restaurants (in case you get there at like 12:01 and don't wanna wait 15 minutes in line to order)

Price: All tacos are around $5 or $6, depending on fanciness level. 

Food: The tacos are delicious! They're fully stuffed with veggies, guacamole, etc. and held together by 2 tortillas. The meat is very tasty, especially the carnitas. The baja fish is quite good, except it's pretty oily and can't compare to Bareo Coreano or Playa Cabana. 

Seating: The line is very long, and there's only 5 seats. So either come early or take it to go... Or stand ominously over people who are sitting until they leave. 

Overall: Good value delicious tacos with a long line. Best time to come is around 11:55am, 5 minutes before they open.
