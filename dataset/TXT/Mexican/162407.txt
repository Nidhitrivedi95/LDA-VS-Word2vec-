L2iT7pipc455Tgpbo35_mw Terrible service. The server(Kayla) had an attitude and was rude when my friend asked to turn one of the portable heater. Security never ID'd us at the door but when my friend and I wanted to use the restroom and take pics they decide they wanna ID us.Came as a group to celebrate a friends birthday and will not be back, and won't recommend it to anyone.
