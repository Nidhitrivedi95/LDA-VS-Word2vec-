izNFwY0XMPsmmUDaSzB9ig I am a frequent customer of Sabor and I've been to almost every location they have and I've loved them all. This one is closet to my home, so I was super excited to try it. Placed a to go order and had to call several times before the phone was even answered. I placed my order and was told that it would take ten minutes. I arrived in 15 minutes, paid, then had to wait another 15 minutes to receive my good. I ordered chips with my food and didn't receive it and had to wait another 5 minutes on that. To top it all off, the employees, especially the guy running the register, weren't even friendly. Things happen, but the one thing you can always provide is friendly service and I didn't even receive that. I will not be returning to this location.
