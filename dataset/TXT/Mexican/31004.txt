4enw_5SjmPuVpxg8MhbPBw Five coworkers and I came here a few days after they opened.  We all agreed on a few things : 1) The food was cold.  Chicken, beans, even after heating the burrito on the grill, the fillings were cold.  2) Service was awful.  It was close to impossible to understand the people making the burrito, and they even seemed confused as to who should be doing what.  3) Food quality was so-so.  Portion was decent.
