gldPX9ANF5Nic0N7igu2og Just got done with our meal at Condado Tacos. First off, the food and drink at Condado Tacos was phenomenal. We also loved the concept of the order sheet. The bummer is that the hostess was very rude. We were seated close to the hostess stand and she was rude to everyone that walked in. As she is the first person you see, we feel that this gave a negative feeling to the experience. Also, she complained multiple times when we were eating and she complained with another coworker. This needs to be corrected by management as this is makes the restaurant not as pleasant. Aside from that, everything was great with both our servers being nice and attentive.
