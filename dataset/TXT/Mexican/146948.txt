JMwwxARF34aR1aq7hzpiJQ I am SOo happy they opened a Pupusa chain in Las Vegas.  I've had these homemade & this place is the closest thing to it! If you've never had a Pupusas it's a handmade masa stuffed in usually pork, beans, cheese or chicken all or one or 2? How ever you would likeTopped with a vinegar slaw & a tangy sweet red sauce. Then cooked on a stone.. You can watch the ladies work their magic as they are made to order.. Now that is some generational skills passed down.  If you've never had one I suggest you try..
