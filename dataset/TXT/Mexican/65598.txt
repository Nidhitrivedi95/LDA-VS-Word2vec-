bBDk37NRCuZndzgDG5j1Tw With a stomach that was begging for something to eat I can easily tell you that tacos are always on my mind, I came here for a random get together with friends and I found this gem. El Gordo Tacos provides the ambiance of a small Mexican dinner and the casual fixtures of Montreal. The service staff was there and provided me with answers to all my questions. Beer is a must if you're not too sure what you want. I felt like be adventurous and ordered the Lamb nachos. No, no you read right... LAMB. Can I say that these were delicious! The sweetness of the corn and the spiciness of the peppers were just great.

With the nachos I ordered 4 tacos for the small price of 10$.. in which you get what you pay for and that's it. They were tasty but nothing I haven't tried before... but those nachos though...*insert droll pic.

Overall I was very surprised on what they offered and didn't leave with an empty stomach. This place is worth a shot and also take advantage of their small terrace!
