ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA Fantastica! The most authentic Mexican restaurant in Vegas. A bit off the beaten path & with an inconspicuous curb appeal. Nice & cool inside, very clean, vaulted ceilings, gorgeous hardwood floors & thick wood tables. Friendly, professional service. Welcomed by staff when entering & leaving. Food was delicious, good portions & prices. Carnitas were asi-asi, came as chopped pieces & a bit dry. Camarones were excellent. Definitely recommend & will visit again.
