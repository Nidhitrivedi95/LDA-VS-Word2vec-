e4NQLZynhSmvwl38hC4m-A I have been here a couple of times and it was alright. Enough to come back a couple more times. I am not sure that I will be coming back again. First off it was extremely busy which is a good sign that a place is good. I had called my order ahead and came to pick it up. It was ready pretty quickly - we got a bean and cheese tostada, a bean and cheese gordita, 2 carne asada tacos, a chicken quesadilla, a bag of chips and salsa and a carne asada burrito. When I opened up the bag and took of the foil the food did not look very good. Some of the food was kind of unrecognizable that I actually went it and had them double check my order. The two tacos kind of seemed that they were thrown together and one was on top of the other but my son said that he liked them. The burrito was a good size burrito and my daughter said it was ok. My other two kids split a chicken quesadilla and they both ate the whole thing. The tostada and the gordita were small - about the size of a corn tortilla and really smashed. When I pulled off the foil most of the cheese and some of the beans came off. The gordita tasted fried, which I had asked for it grilled, maybe frying is part of it being a gordita but there was not much difference in what it looked like. Also after taking my first bite into the gordita I found a hair. Nothing to turn you off from food faster is finding a hair in your food. I ripped off the part that had the hair in it and threw it away before my kids saw it because as a mom I know that if they had seen the hair they would have refused to eat their food and honestly I did not want to waste $27 in food. The tostada was pretty good which I shared with my baby. Even though there is many good reviews for this place I most likely won't be coming back after my experience.
