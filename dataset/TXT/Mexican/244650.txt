TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag This is it everyone. It's the most authentic Mexican tacos I've had here in Cleveland. In the summer, you can find the taco cart out in front of this Mexican grocery store. They have 5 different types of meat and I have to say that my favorite is the Barbacoa - juicy fatty pork freshly heated up on the grill. Follow up favorites are the chorizo and al pastor.They also have some legit peppers on the side.

I wish they had a bigger salsa bar with the hot hot stuff, but they offer onions, cilantro, and a few different salsas.

This is our go to if we want some tacos. Those other places just don't have this kind of flavor!!!
