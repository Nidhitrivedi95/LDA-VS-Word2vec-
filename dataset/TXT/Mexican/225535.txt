About 6 months ago, I went to Tacos El Gordo just to find the establishment closed with no signage indicating a reopen. This was so tragic that it took out a piece of my soul and I actually was way less excited to go to Vegas again...

...but lo, the powers that be have put this place back on the map. It hasn't skipped a beat.

Tacos El Gordo doesn't make any sense. Delicious, nearly flawless, incredibly cheap tacos served almost in the shadow of Wynncore. Things on the strip shouldn't be so delicious while being so cheap because it feels like there's a scam somewhere.

Anyhow, the chorizo and asada tacos are banging. The meat is cooked so tenderly and so perfectly. It's spiced so perfectly. You can get full for like 8 dollars. This shit is psychotic and I'm so, so happy that this is a viable Vegas dining option once more.
