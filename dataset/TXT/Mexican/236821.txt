sW3oXGgDbbOC3YkiFKZNMQ Today we ordered food online, like we have many times before. I had my daughter go pick it up at the time we where told, 6:30, and when she arrived it wasn't ready yet. Thankfully they jumped right on the order, even gave her a free drink while waiting. Everything was perfect, but my younger son let the dog eat his bowl... So, i put another order right in and even got a phone call almost immediately because they thought i was putting in an order because something was messed up, nope my dog was just hungry. Great customer service and always very fast. Favorite chipotle!
