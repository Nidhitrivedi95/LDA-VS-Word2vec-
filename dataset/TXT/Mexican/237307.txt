SWDxTrwU_qlEcJp36IYquw I am originally from Miami, and one of the things I miss most is the Cuban food.  I've finally found a restaurant with the authentic flavors I remember so fondly.  This was our first time here, and I know it won't be our last.

We shared the papa relleno appetizer, which was delicious!  I had the ropa vieja with congri and sweet plantains.  Everything was wonderful!!!  My hubby had the Cuban sandwich.  He really liked the sandwich, but said the bread was too hard and crumbly.

I was also a bit disappointed that they had run out of the ham croquetas...one of my all-time favorites.

Other than that, this place makes me so happy!  I can't wait to head back for some more!!
