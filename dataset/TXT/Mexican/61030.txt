arpBUwgiaE8iqfNGMQ_hgg Big Fat Burrito isn't misleading anyone. It's just that...
It's a burrito, it's big and it's likely to make you feel fat after you inhale one.

This corner hugging, Mexicana styled burrito joint has been a staple to the Kennsignton community for years. Whether you're a local, a weekend dweller or a tourist just passing through, you're sure to hit that hunger pang in the sweet spot, with one of these loaded torpedo's. 

Big Fat Burrito has many options on their board: Pork, Chicken, Beef, Yam, Veggie or Steak. Best part about it...you can combine the yam with any of them. I usually get the chicken and yam. Surprisingly the chicken is moist. They also load it with all of the good toppings and you have a choice of sour cream or their special burrito sauce. Go for the special sauce.

BFB, can be hit and miss. Some days the flavors are out of this world, and other days, it's just a sloppy bland mess. 

It's not the best burrito in the city, but if you're starving and in the neighbourhood, it's worth the indigestion.
