_5S-0t10CgqKuMW6yiklHQ Came on a Sunday right before noon and just beat the church crowd like we hoped. This was my first time here and I was amazed at how crowded it got so quickly. We were seated right away but people after us weren't so lucky as they were stacked up outside. They had a Mexican buffet and a large menu with many items on it. Note of caution: if you don't like onions don't come here. There are loads and loads of onions in everything! The menu even states they have onions in everything. The only selection my poor wife had was a quesadilla because she hates onions. I chose the buffet and was not impressed with the what they had available. Enchiladas with ground beef and onions, taquitos with chicken and onion, ground beef and onion tacos, Mexican rice with onions, fried okra, French fries, refried beans (surprisingly with no onions), some quesadillas, and all the accoutrements that come along with Mexican food such as salsa, guacamole, sour cream, and cheese. They also had sopas for dessert. Overall the food was mediocre at best. The cost for the buffet for one and a quesadilla for my wife and two diet cokes came to a little over $15. We weren't rushed or anything but with the amount of people there they did run out of plates. The waiter was attentive to our needs as much as he could be; I never had an empty cup. I would not recommend this place to others as I have been to many other places that put this place to shame.
