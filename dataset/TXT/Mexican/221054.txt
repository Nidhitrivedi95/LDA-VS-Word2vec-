RKX755uAGPMerCWueEpevQ Kind of torn on this place. I have had some good food here but the place inside leaves a lot to desired. It seems as though even if the smallest effort went into cleaning this place up you would see a drastic change. Not sure why this is not being done. It is one of the weirdest environments you will ever eat in. The place has not changed in years. It always feels dirty and unkept. Not sure why the effort is not being put forth. The food prices are a little high considering the environment. If they did clean the place up and make it more inviting, I know they could attract more people.   4 stars for the food, 1 for the experience inside, get food to go if you order from here.
