eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg In town for a conference. Wanted great, authentic Mexican. The drinks were very tasty. We had table side quac made and she insisted that we get the pomegranate seeds in it. That was surprisingly tasty even though I thought overall the avocado was very chunky. I like a nice blend of chunky and smooth. My chicken enchiladas were tasty but not the saucy goodness I was hoping for. There was a thick layer of cheese baked on top and no beans and rice to pull it all together. They also brought me veggie enchiladas at first and half way thru I realized there would never be meat. Lol had to send back. The server fixed it right away.
