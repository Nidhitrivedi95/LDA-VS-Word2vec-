sS__otwzn0INyR_5Dimfdg Just going through the drive thru the lady was like what do you want? I told her if I can take a moment. When ready to order I said I was ready... But no reply after a couple of seconds I heard people in the microphones background. So I went said Hello she was like what do you want so I asked if there was Pico De Gallo in the asada Burrito. The lady replied its a asada Burrito come with only that. If you want something you need to say it. I thought the person was rude so I decided to take my service elsewhere. Made my first time experience there horrible will never return.
