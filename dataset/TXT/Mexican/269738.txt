woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ This place is very hip and trendy and hard to get a table. In other words, a kind of place I would normally avoid these days as I have very little patience particularly while hungry. However, my dining companion was nice enough to make a reservation for us, and when we were feeling like two old ladies and wanted to try to show up to sit earlier than our set reservation, they were surprisingly fine with it and let us sit right away. I think what makes it hard is if you show up with no reservation and a big group, as I saw several of those lingering by the door hoping to be seated. 

While entering the restaurant you can peek in the window and see the cooks making fresh tortillas and I knew it would be a good taco experience because - let's be honest - so much depends on the tortilla! We went with the mushroom and Baja tacos, which were HUGE and though they're pricey for tacos (about $12-15), the ingredients are top quality and the portions are satisfying. We also got the guac and the street corn and starters, which was maybe not the smartest thing to do as it did fill us up, but both were delish as well! 

We were having a non-drinking evening so the server offered to make us virgin versions of their watermelon basil  margarita and OMG - they were so refreshing and fresh! 

As for the ambiance, it's very dark and loud and trendy, as I've mentioned, so maybe not the best place if you're in the mood for a romantic date or a chill conversation. It felt very see and be seen, but again the helpful service and the high quality food helped it live up to the hype. 

Huge fan, hope I can return soon!
