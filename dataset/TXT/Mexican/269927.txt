woY5rYqcdtzHRJnWarLuAg I was in Chandler this weekend and picked up some food for this week. I like this concept as its quick, easy, fresh and healthy. They are perfectly portioned as most restaurants tend to give you 2-3 servings and the variety of foods is excellent. I particularly like the yogurt parfaits, its like dessert in a cup! Can't wait for more stores to open near my house.
