gT4gngtGKYOW-jl5UIBahg The service was great as soon as me and my family walked in. Great overall vibes. We ordered sushi which took a bit longer than the other food but I did not mind one bit. The food was delicious. The gentleman who took our order was super attentive and had amazing customer service. Also very informative for this being our first time!I would definitely come back and recommend anyone to come!!
