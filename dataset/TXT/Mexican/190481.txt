oE6gKgUfMd74m77d6hG9qg I absolutely love this place. I am originally from California,and was unable to find an  authentic Mexican food place that served decent tamales..that is until I came here.The son and father  that own it ,were very polite,and even put in some plates,and forks with my order.They smelt so good, I sat in my vehicle and ate two. Very moist, seasoned just right,and the size was just right for the price. I highly recommend this establishment,they have a life time customer here
