I came here with a large group at 3pm on a Sunday. Unfortunately the service was abysmal. 

We had a young, blond, male waiter who was constantly forgetting to bring things our group had either ordered or asked for. Several in our party ordered the special "all you can eat" taco deal which serves approximately two tacos at once and then requires you to order another two each time you're ready for a "refill". Our waiter repeatedly forgot to bring several of the people in our party their taco refills. I ordered a kale salad (which was delicious) so I didn't have this problem personally, but it was annoying to witness nonetheless. 

I loved my salad. Would have loved not to have to ask for water twice, a drink refill twice, and a "to go" box twice when I was ready to leave! I may give this place another shot but only in a party of two or less. I won't go with a big group again.
