Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ My wife and I went here for dinner on a Thursday at 7:00 and were seated quickly. Dress seems casual and up depending on the table you look at. Ambiance was great! This place looks so cool when you walk in. The service was fantastic but I forget our servers name. Higher end menu with a decent variety, heavy on the seafood options. Ordered steak and it was cooked well. We're from Texas and we both thought the food was on par for the price, but we've had better. I might go again on another trip to Vegas.
