591UZJIUNgPwxXRvQMIUkw Extremely annoyed. This chipotle is so inconsistent with their portions and the individuals working here are completely useless. I don't know why I'm so LOYAL to this location. I had to repeat my order twice as usual because they're either not paying attention or don't know how to utilize their ears. Moving on, my bowl was finished after what seemed me looking and obtaining the lost ark and she can't put a lid on my bowl. She wasted like three lids only to remake my bowl and when I got back to the office I realized they did this bowl different with the ingredients I didn't want one here. Chipotle at this location. You guys need to unfuck yourselves. I'm tired of this treatment so I will try my hardest not to come here anymore and just find a way to make it downtown. On top of all this after them making me late I caught every red light possible. F you guys!
