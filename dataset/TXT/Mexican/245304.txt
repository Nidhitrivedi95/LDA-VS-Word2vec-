TQPxHfKykLLG6echeHru-g I went a long time ago and remember it being awesome. My girlfriend and I where in the area and decided to go for lunch. It was packed but the staff was extremely accommodating and efficient. Quick service and the food was excellent. After 2 meals , 2 drinks and a churro we left extremely satisfied and it came out to only 30$ for two. I recommend to anyone who likes authentic Mexican .
