O1ird5yRyuDFnOmYu90OoA Checked out the Cantina on a reco, and can't wait to go back!

Went for dinner on a Saturday with friends and the folks.  We were lucky to get a seat on the outside patio - which was a completely different experience than sitting inside.

Ambiance:  I personally loved eating outside on the patio in the great weather and surrounded by alot of energy from the mostly younger crowd.  Everyone was minding their own business and having a great time.  The decor was light and hinted just enough at it's mexican roots.  Given the drink and tapas style of the place, the patio was well suited.  The only possible area for improvement could be in the lighting - at times we had to use our phones to read the menu.

Menu:  I was a bit thrown off that 75% of the menu was drinks and the actual food options were quite limited.  This turned out to be just fine by us.  The drinks selections were plentiful with enough Margarita and Tequila options to have you hitting the floor on multiple visits ;).  The food consisted primarily of tacos and nachos.  The Salsa & Guacamole were excellent and quite fresh.  All of our taco orders (4 different types) were very tasty and (along with the chips), were able to fill us up.

Pricing: $4/taco might seem steep for some folks, but they're packed in with ingredients and will definitely fill you up.  A pitcher for margarita was only $20, which is also a fantastic deal!

Would I go back? You betcha!   Maybe i'll sit inside next time and catch the El Luchador wrestling movies put on the big screen!
