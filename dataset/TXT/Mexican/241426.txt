TCoBE_BkDRrK0bWrh5VueQ Crazy loud fun unusual authentic taco place of the Gods.  Literally my last Vegas meal before flying home, and walked in to live Mariachi band that were as perfect as you can get.  Little confusing cafeteria style ordering area with different stations for different tacos and sides, they need to setup a flowing single line to make that flow better and eliminate the confusion.  With that said, who can complain about fresh homemade corn tortillas and endless real Mexican meat choices from chicken to beef to pork to fresh garnishes of fresh lettuce onions cilantro etc.  Was sorry was in a rush as I have to go back to try the roasted corn, quesadillas etc.  My al pastor  tacos were delicious as was the amazing salsa bar with endless choices to dress your taco with.  Not the best I have had but pretty good.
