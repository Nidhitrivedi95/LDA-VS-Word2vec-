Enjoyed a nice quite dinner, alone in the dining room. 

The pasta was excellent. We have never tried the pizza before. I highly recommend !  The fish is good as always, but the bun was a bit off. I do suggest ask for the fish without the bun. 

It is a nice family owned restaurant a little out of the way, but worth the trip !
