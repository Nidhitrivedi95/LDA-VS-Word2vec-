u84xKtVRDLuh_P_zXWkzLQ My beloved macho nachos didn't taste the same as I remembered here. The chips were a bit stale. 

Their green chile chicken bowl is pretty good. But you might get the runs soon after. I still like it though since it's a healthier alternative.

Of course, how can you refuse the crunchy taco Tuesday deal. Good junk for the stomach. 

I'm a definite Del taco fan over Taco Bell any day. Oh yeah, cheese cake bites are more like a fried egg roll with cream cheese inside. Not too shabby at all, and much more "gourmet" than I had anticipated. It costs a pretty penny though...
