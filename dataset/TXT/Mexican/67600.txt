bgx6gYdktqEoQwBdo5lRbA I've been coming here for over a year. Food is consistent, and I really like the salsa bar cabbage pickle. My last visit here, which is my last, was marred by the daughter of the owners. I placed my order at the counter, we agreed where I would sit(it was busy, one table remained at the entrance) I said that table would be fine. After I ordered, went to sit down, a newspaper was on the table. She came to give me the chips & said that must be his paper( referring to the man who came in after me, ordered after me) She then asked if I would share the table with him. Then she said " I don't want Him to leave...." bad bad energies given off now from her( but you'd rather I leave?)So, I got up, left the chips, waited by the register counter for another table. Long story short, I will not ever eat here again.  Your parents were nice to me and my daughter, but then again, where did you get your ways from? All of us carry the same fiat.
