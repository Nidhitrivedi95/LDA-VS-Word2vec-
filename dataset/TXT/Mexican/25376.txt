333W59XcrXZsJlnBAAx5mQ I was excited to place a carry out order after looking over the menu. We made our choices and called.  To our surprise, they refused to take my order and stated that they do not provide take out service - he stated they are dine in only.  What an odd decision for a restaurant to refuse extra customers without taking up a table.  It's a shame, but with all the Mexican restaurants to choose from, I'm not sure I will choose to dine in at this restaurant in the future.
