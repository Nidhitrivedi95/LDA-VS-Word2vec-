LkgqiRF3LaZCVQmDFC0AaA I was so happy to find a Mexican restaurant coming to North York, I was simply ecstatic. So as soon as I spotted lights inside Estrella I rushed in to check it out. My verdict: it's simply a Mexican version of Smokey Joe's that occupied the walls previously, that means the booze and vibe are worthy of pub crowd's attention, but dinner is better be sourced else where.

Decor: Great job on revamping the old place, there's a variety of seating options, from booths to hight tables and even a small hang out corner, not a single square inch of space was wasted. Art works on the walls are funky and definitely bring Día de Muertos closer to home. 

Food: Very weak, almost everything needs improvement. All three tacos we tried were on a dry side and boring on flavour. Guacamole is spiced with some sort of spicy oil? not fresh peppers. Grilled jalapenos were unremarkable if not oily. Bean dip is the only dish we enjoyed. And that would have been ok, had I not spent all night with a stomach ache after eating at Estrella, sadly the other party reported similar symptoms.

Alcohol: Surprisingly a great selection of booze, great beer list that goes from best Mexican varieties to Belgian ales and some Canadian crafts. Cocktails sounded delicious and emphasis on bourbon and tequila is greatly appreciated. I'll come back to try their Sangria and Mojito. So if you're thirsty, that's the place to be.

Atmosphere: The vibe was amazing. The space is big enough to diffuse crowd buzz to a comfortable level and DJ did a fantastic job spinning tunes from around the globe keeping the spirits up and moving to the grooves. I hope he'll become a regular thing at Estrella. There are also pinpong tables for your amusement as well as nice tv screens to watch a game.

Overall: Would have been a solid 3 had I not gotten so sick after eating here. I'll be back for more drinks and maybe test food options on my other friends.
