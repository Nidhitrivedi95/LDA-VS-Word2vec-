35tWXOOJpWB2feUAEJyJyg When you ask for no lettuce in your taco and you know he understood you because the receipt says so but the taco maker failed to notice on his screen. Not cool man. I was counting on you to deliver what I ordered a simple order test you failed. Story of Taco Bell at times. 

Place is clean. Staff friendly. Orders right most of the time. That's all I have.
