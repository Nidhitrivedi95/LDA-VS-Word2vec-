aWYWNfHuQJyRwDHaHq8X1w My friend and I had a hankering for tacos, and I remembered this little gem. It's such an awesome place for some really delicious and filling tacos, at an equally amazing price! The atmosphere is cozy, but not overly loud like it can get in smaller place; and our waitress was the perfect amount of attentive and sweet. I ordered the backyard BBQ and shrimp tequila taco platter, and I swear I died and went to taco heaven! I also ordered the margarita flight (prickly pear, mango, and melon) which was super adorable, and hit that perfect sweet to match with the salty tacos. YUUUUMMMM-O!!!
