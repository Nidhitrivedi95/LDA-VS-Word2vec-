dNjgjAoJSJsvgc5g6nQnnw Been here before service/food is usually  great. Just walked in, there's about 5 customers waiting, no cashier. Finally after 5 minutes cashier comes walking from back still on the phone and says " what do u want?" Wow, really??!!! Then he was talking and almost forgot to give me my $14 change!! When he did and me my change the wasn't even looking at me and instead was turned around joking with the cook while talking in the phone!! Come on man!! Someone needs to do some better hiring!!
