WLblFINiPI18_o1OdDsnVg I want to start this review by saying that Cafe Rio is one of my favorite places to eat. I am from Salt Lake City where the lines are out the door at Cafe Rio and everyone loves it. With that being said I am very disappointed with the quality of this location. I ordered a steak quesadilla, which comes with sour cream only to find out after it was made that they don't have sour cream and they are out for the night. If the employee would of told me that prior to I would of ordered something else. Second they were out of Diet Coke and from going there a few times is not uncommon. Third the place is filthy, there was so much trash in the garbage cans that you couldn't throw anything away. The bathroom was disgusting and there were no paper towels. You can just tell by being there that no one cares about the business and there is clearly no leadership there. I never thought I would ever give a place I enjoy so much a terrible review, but this is not the first time this location has disappointed and by reading some of the other reviews seems like it's quit common. Hopefully this review will help to turn this place around.
