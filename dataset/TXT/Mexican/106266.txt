I have a place with a drive thru closer to my home, but I drive over here and get out of the car instead, because the quality is so much better. I personally like the quesadilla and the nachos with grilled chicken. I also like the breakfast burrito with chorizo. My wife likes the adobada and carne asada. The employees are very nice here and the salsa bar clean and inviting. The muted green salsa is perfect on the chorizo.
