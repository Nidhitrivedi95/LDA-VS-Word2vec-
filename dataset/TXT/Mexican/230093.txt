Sh_c-UZ8Tk_H1porVieNmA Stopped here mainly for drinks and some appetizers.  While the cocktails were great, the free homemade dortitos were outstanding and probably the best part about coming here.  The ceviche was fresh, but a little expensive for a "snack" at $14.  My only knock was the small servings of chips that came in quite possibly the smallest paper bag ever made.
