We got the guacamole to start (awesome), chicken enchilada and a bunch of different tacos. All the tacos were amazing but the beer battered fish ones were our favourite. Had churro sundae and fudge duo for dessert and both were phenomenal. We tried almost all of the margaritas and they were all great! The vibe here is great and the service was top notch. We had a very fun evening!
