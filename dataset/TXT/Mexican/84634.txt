d8lmIZIqmBC9oPM8y1dc7Q Hello friends,

Third time (writing a review) the charm. I'm always satisfied when i come here. I like the menu. I like the menu so much in fact that I noticed I purchased the same exact thing the last time I was here. After i post my most recent pictures I noticed I ordered the same last time.

This place has more than enough reviews in which I'm sure are perfect. I  most likely won't be able to add much to the already made reviews other than the food is good. 

The drinks..... well.. they are as strong as Barry Bonds, Mark McGwire & Sammy Sosa combined!! And in THIS CASE...that's a good thing. 

TTFN
