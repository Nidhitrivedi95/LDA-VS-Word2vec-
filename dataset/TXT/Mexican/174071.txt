MkP_RUY-cEF3B4e7hf7KmA Love this place! I'm addicted to their shrimp tacos. The shrimp are plump and juicy. The avocado, greens, and sauce enhance the shrimp without masking their flavor. 

My husband and I also appreciate that their flavored teas are unsweetened. He adds their Stevia (not many places provide Stevia). My daughter loves their Pomegranate lemonade. 

All in all, great selections and a pleasant environment, inside & outdoor seating.
