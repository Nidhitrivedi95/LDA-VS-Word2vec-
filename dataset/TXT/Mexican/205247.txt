PvXIIRzRZGUMnu0CYEax4w The food is what you expect, but that's why you're there! Love the Fries Supreme regardless its nutritional content. Meximelts or Gordita Crunch are my go-to when I get a craving.

There aren't many locations around, so I can't compare, but this has THE slowest drive thru. I stop here a few times a year and each time, I've put my car in Park. At least they're consistent, right?
