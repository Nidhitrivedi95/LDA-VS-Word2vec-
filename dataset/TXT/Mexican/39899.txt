6LVadHqqjWlVnd-T7gAZyA Had a great dinner at Garcia's this evening.  Ate at a table in the bar where we got Happy Hour prices on our drinks.  Margaritas and beers are good sized . The whole staff was friendly and we liked our food.  Service was fast.  This will become our go to mexican place if all our experiences are like this.
