Most burrito joints I go for bean and cheese, with all of the fillings I tend to find the meat takes over (plus I'm getting some protein in the beans), but Chipotle's steak has really impressed me. It's always perfectly cooked with some pink on the inside! The reason I go for the bowl here is that they don't grill the burritos so I find the tortilla a bit too chewy and unnecessary on the calorie front. The bowl comes with rice (white or brown - I usually go for white), beans (black for me), salsa (the spicy red tomatillo is truly fantastic, hot but super flavourful as well), and then lettuce, cheese, sour cream, and I pay the RIDICULOUS 2.25 for guacamole too. To me guac is a necessary burrito topping and should be included everywhere.

Anyways this is a super filling meal but incredibly tasty. You can split it over two meals for sure and at least you rest easy knowing the ingredients are fresh and the meat is local. 

I'm a regular at the Front St. location but I have to say the Yonge location, albeit way busier, has better service. 

Final thought: my husband has the app and it's really handy to pre-order if you're going during a busy time! You can head right to the cash to grab and go.
