mI5UYpuYxjiumMLgANoa9A Really wanted some good Mexican food and had not been to this location in a few years. Ordered #20 - one Taco and one Enchilada with rice and beans. Large portions. Able to get lunch and dinner out of the one meal. Price has gone up, as expected. Food was very good.  Shout out to Diego who demonstrated excellent customer service and signed me up for the "Belly" tag reward program. Looking forward to my next visit.
