5eKk8dA1QtKaQr_5i_SCRw I was in town and was looking for a good Mexican restaurant.   This was recommended to me by a local I met.   The location was great as it was in the middle of market square.   It was on the second floor which was cool as you could look at the square from above.   

I sat at the bar as the conversations are a little bit better and you can get a glimpse on what really goes on.  Overall the place was ok.   My biggest issue was that they didn't provide chips and salsa (free).  Don't get me wrong, I am not cheap but WHAT MEXICAN FOOD RESTAURANT DOESNT PROVIDE FREE CHIPS AND SALSA?????  The obvious answer is this one.  

I got the 4 Enchilada plate (2 chicken, 2 pork) with verde sauce.   The chicken was a little chewy but the pork was pretty good.  It also came with 2 sides so I got the black beans and cilantro rice.  Overall it was pretty good.   They could do a few more things to make this place good.
