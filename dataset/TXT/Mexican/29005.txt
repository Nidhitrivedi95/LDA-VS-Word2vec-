3X-jhrbCSMv5hfUS02xdHA This was our first visit to this location and we were anticipating a great dinner. The restaurant ambience lacks imagination. It is very clean and sterile with a hint of old New Mexican decor. We ordered the 2 taco plate and poblano chicken enchiladas. The ground beef in the hard shelled tacos was very dry and had a "gamey " taste. The large dollop of hot sauce was a little too much. The enchiladas were served with the chicken pieces on top and green poblano sauce poured over the whole enchilada. I also had the margarita which was not frozen and overpowering with tartness. Overall our experience was less than anticipated but par with most restaurants in Ahwatukee.
