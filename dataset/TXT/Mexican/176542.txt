MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA There is really only one prerequisite to you loving this place - you have to have taste buds.  That's all.  Actually scratch that, I don't even think you'll need taste buds, just a taste bud, only one working taste bud.  Now let's be clear, we are talking tacos here.  Nothing crazy, just tacos.  But the kind of taco one might start a fight for.  The kind of taco that makes you want to propose... to the taco.  Get the crispy cauliflower, fish, and pork belly.  Three points on the taco compass.  Eat them out back, at one of the communal tables.  Drink at least one margarita per taco.  Marvel at what a good time it is to be alive.
