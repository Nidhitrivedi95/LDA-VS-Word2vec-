cYhv7XVpqJIpb6BLzZBaFQ Because I'm transplanted here from San Diego, Mexican food is always part of my weekly, if not daily, menu plan.  For the most part I've been able to make due with nuking something from Trader Joe's frozen food case, but when I want REAL Mexican food and a margarita, Maya's is where I head to.  And on the weekend so does everyone else.  The place is always packed!

When I visit Maya's I feel like I'm back in San Diego, seated at the landmark, Old Town Mexican Cafe.  People, this is the real deal.  Maya's serves authentic Mexican food.  Is it gourmet Mexican food?  No, but then I'm not someone who wants a $25 plate of chicken mole, either.  Maya's satisfies my craving.

They offer pork carnitas which are every bit as good as those served in San Diego.  ditto the chips, salsa, guacamole...... and margaritas.  If, like me, you prefer shredded beef rather than the 'Americanized' ground beef, Maya's has it, so ask!  If you haven't experienced shredded beef, give it a try in whatever you'd normally have ground beef. 

The taco salads here are wonderful and so tasty, especially when I cover it with their homemade salsa.  OMG!  I'm in heaven!  The chicken is all white meat, and so much of it that I've often joked that it's not even a salad because there's more meat than greens.  LOL  The salad & chips are enough to have me waddling out of here wishing I had stopped eating when I was full half a salad ago. It just tastes so good I can't stop eating until I feel sick.  ha ha ha

Fast service, free refills on fountain drinks, never ending chips and salsa. 
Maya's makes may homesickness for San Diego much easier to deal with.
