The whole time we were there the waitress asked us over and over again if we wanted sour cream or guacamole or Baja sauce and on and on and on without mentioning ANYTHING about the items costing extra. When we got the bill I saw why. She managed to work that bill up 50% in just condiments! On top of that she charged us for an extra drink which we did not get. It was our first time there and after eating we were happy to have found a new place to eat. Sadly, after the car salesman approach from the wait staff, we will have to pass.
