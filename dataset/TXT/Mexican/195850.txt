oxICG1HQrL0lTvJEZ3zXcw Chips and salsa were fantastic. I'm very picky about my salsa I like spicy and not watery. I hate when places give you Pico and try to pass it off as salsa. Salsa had great flavor. Really good lunch specials. I ordered the tacos, 2 carne asada and one carnitas. The tortillas come double and I took off the extra one. Rice was fluffy. Cool place to eat if you venture outside the strip. Friendly service
