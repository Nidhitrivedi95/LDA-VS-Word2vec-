Never been when it was Tostadas and Tacos, but the new management and place is definitely worth 5 stars.

The staff was really friendly. The place is really clean with an A grade.

The food was really amazing and very fresh. I ordered the taco combo with carnitas. And they were some of the best I've had. My girlfriend had the same but with carne asada, and it was just as good. The combo was served with rice and beans. Also we ordered some chips and salsa. The red mild was ok. My girlfriend had a different one. Cant remember what it was exactly but it was spicier and she really enjoyed it.

Definitely give this place a shot if youre craving some tacos. Only downside is they don't offer lengua tacos!
