OjnRf8yDGEBCoUDdchSViw There were not many options for a picky 4 year old at Food Truck Friday this week, but Jamburritos delivered.  They had a Cheese Crisp and Hushpuppies combo for kids ($5), so I decided to order my lunch there, too.

I ordered the buffalo chicken and waffles special ($8).  The chicken was delicious and I mean DELICIOUS.  I can't say much about the waffle because... well, I could not eat it.  Unfortunately it had bacon on it.  It was disappointing because the waffle looked perfect and had a nice dusting of powdered sugar on it.  Anyone else would probably appreciate the bacon, but I don't eat pork.  

Five stars for an operation with great employees and great food.

Minus one star because the menu did not specify bacon was on the dish I ordered and because a cheese crisp should never be $5 (even though it was pretty big).

Lesson learned - I will ask next time about the ingredients.  Yes, I would eat here again!
