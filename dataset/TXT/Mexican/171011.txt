m7vv40MnYXdvxRkGCYhGTQ Yesss a Chipotle! My family was staying in Amherst for a few days and I was really craving Chipotle. I was so glad to have found one nearby! This Chipotle is pretty much the same as any - got my typical white rice bowl with fajitas, chicken, tomatoes, hot salsa, corn, cheese, lettuce, and tortilla and beans on the side. The rice was a bit softer than I would have liked (and softer than at other Chipotles...or other parts of my food was too wet), but the meat was very flavorful (there were quite a bit of fat pieces though). At $6.50 total, it's definitely a steal! Yum yum yum. Lots of places to sit, and the employees are pretty friendly and fast at making your bowl too!
