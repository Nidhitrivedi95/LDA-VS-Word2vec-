erx8tQ0Wdc5YM0FddaKqKA My rating seemed like a no-brainer to me.  The atmosphere is fun and they've really gone all out with the hipster mexican theme.  My husband and I went there for a late lunch/early dinner on a Saturday and it was pretty empty.  The service was excellent and the food was amazing.  We ordered the pork belly and duck tacos.  I really enjoyed the presentation style of the food - wood board instead of a plate. The house-made corn tortillas were really the icing on the cake for these tacos.  They were so good.  
We had 30 minutes to eat and get to a movie in the works, and we did it successfully.  I was only disappointed I didn't have time to try any of their margaritas.  The serving size was perfect for me, and I left feeling satisfied, but not stuffed.  
I would definitely come back here sometime when I have time to have a drink with my meal.
