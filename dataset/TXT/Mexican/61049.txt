arpBUwgiaE8iqfNGMQ_hgg Most medicore burrito for the most ridiculous price. $12 for a burrito isn't that high, it's mid-high but the burritos here are really weak. They barely had cheese int hem and the meat is non-existant. It's really disappointing. They mostly fill your burrito with rice and beans. Do you like lots of rice and beans? Place is a perfect match for you.

So yeah I wouldn't go back here. Ever. Burrito Boyz is so much more worth it at almost all of their locations. Burrito Boyz started charging extra for guac but they actually give you guac. This location claimed they added guac but I never even once tasted it.
