mI5UYpuYxjiumMLgANoa9A I love filibertos, I'll begin with that. BUT holy crap this place is absolutely terrible. Every time I come to this establishment it's like playing Russian roulette with my order. The communication skills of the workers at the drive through is at best, sub par. 

Although I had the most interesting drive through experience of my life here...when I pulled up to the window the lovely woman promptly asked if I was a stoner. She then began to try to bargain a discount for in exchange for any marijuana. Nice lady but super weird...and I was low anyways. 

I'll go back to my first comment that I absolutely love filibertos. After a long day of work all I want is my burrito and my order to be correct even after clarifying multiple times. 

Don't come here.
