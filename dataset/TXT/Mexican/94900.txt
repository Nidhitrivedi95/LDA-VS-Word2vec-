EBCuO36WpwDNhf37YIhklg I should have checked Yelp before we went to this place. This place had by far the worst Mexican food I have ever had, and I've eaten at Mexican restaurants in Michigan!  Salsa tasted right out of a can, no hint of heat and had some weird herb flavors going on that didn't make sense.  The chicken tacos were edible, but they really needed pico de gallo.  Oh yeah, they came with something that was called pico de gallo but it most certainly wasn't.  They also came with some other sauce that we are guessing was supposed to be some sort of cheese sauce but it just looked and tasted like yellow milk.  The rice was horrible! Rice-a-roni Mexican or Spanish rice would actually be an improvement for this place.  We never tried any of the Italian food.  If it is better, then I strongly suggest they drop the "Garcias" and just do Italian food.

Pros:
 -waitress was a total sweetheart
 - we did get our food quickly (we were the only people in the restaurant though)
 - tortilla chips and corn tortillas for tacos were actually really good & fresh, I'm guessing they get them from some local place
 - great patio, perfect place to sit and have a beer, but bring your own salsa
