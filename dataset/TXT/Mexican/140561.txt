This restaurant had lots of good reviews on yelp and I love tacos so I thought I would give it a try. I travel for a living and make it a point to find taco stands, taco trucks, or anything taco related wherever I go.  

I was disappointed here.

I read several reviews about the service been so-so to lousy, and that was my experience today.  The hostess was slow to recognize me when I walked up, took some menus and said she would be right back. She did not say hi or welcome me, just turned around and left.

I went to go sit at the bar and was also slow to be recognized as far as a greeting.  I also had to ask for chips and salsa just like several other yelpers have complained about, because I sat there for five minutes after ordering my tacos, and I still didn't have chips or salsa.  

I ordered the tacos al pastor and ahi tuna combo with rice and beans.  There was plenty of tuna on the one taco, but the taco Al Pastor was the smallest most pathetic taco I think I have ever seen.  I think it had more pineapple than pork.   In fact I'm not even sure there was any meat in it.  Way less tasty than they should have been.  

As for the chips and salsa, the chips were stout, not the flimsy kind and were good enough.  The salsa was thin and runny but the green and red both had good flavor.  Sad to say, then chips and salsa were the best part.
