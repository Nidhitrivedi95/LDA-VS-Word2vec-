CsS9WsonGYyE3vINi5bxSg This place is unreal!! I went here with my wife and 2 friends last Tuesday night, at about 10.20pm and they were about to close the kitchen. Our server named Cort approached the table and explained that the menu was on the chalkboard on the wall and that he would come back soon to tell us about it in detail while set us up with cutlery.

The drinks specials were explained and 3 of us put our hands up instantly when he explained the smoked whiskey sour with charred pig skin. Mind blow. That drink was superb. My wife had a margarita which wasn't sweetened enough.

They have a selection of tacos, appetizers and mains. My friend and I shared the 32oz steak with pineapple kimchi and the girls had tacos. We all had guacamole which was nice, lobster something which was great and crab ceviche which was just ok and shared it all. The flourless chocolate cake was a treat, it came with a matcha green tea ice cream that complimented it perfectly.

Cort then came over with 2 sipping tequilas and explained them to the table. His service was honestly one of the highlights of this place, when he wasn't at the table he was singing along to the music while cleaning up, which added to the great vibe of this place. 

So, four of us ate until we were full. Had a cocktail each and my friends had a nice Tequila each-the bill was $210 we left $50 for Cort because he was great and this is now one of my fave places in the city. 

Big up to the guys in the kitchen for the awesome food, thank you Cort for the great service and a big shout to Nath behind the bar for the drinks. Top experience 9.5/10
