T2tEMLpTeSMxLKpxwFdS3g I never ask to speak to a manager but I almost did. The service was a fail. Not a "sorry" for messing up two orders and dropping ( wasn't rang in) one, but a simple "oh". Refills was like a DMV experience. Food is great but at some point it's not worth it. I hate broda and don't frequent the neighborhood because I don't enjoy the people that live and frequent these haunts. Cabo was the exception. Was. Two stars just because the food is good. As someone that makes his living as a server it erks me when I'm treated this way. Apathy has no place when it comes to service.
