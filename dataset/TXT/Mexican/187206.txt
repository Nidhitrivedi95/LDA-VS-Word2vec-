O1aOpTSYbHmyV_712z5fsQ My first time here was 3 days after opening. I went through the drive thru. I ordered Grilled Chicken.Our 2 sides were Yucca and Rice and then I ordered french fries as well. I should have checked the bag before I left the window. When I got home, I found the whole order was wrong. I took it back and they fixed it. I was very annoyed but didnt want to review them at that time because any new business can have a rough start. Today is black friday. I've worked all day, traffic is awful and I dont want to cook. I decide to give them another try. I went through the drive thru again. No waiting. I ordered only the grilled chicken, no sides. I asked the girl at the window to check it before I leave, she did.
The Chicken was so flavorful and delicious Im certain I'll be bringing that home again. Ive had a few of the sides and they are ok but we really liked the chicken the best.  
I didnt have a single problem this trip so hopefully they've worked out the new business confusion that can sometimes happen.
