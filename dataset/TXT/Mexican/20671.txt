2aiaryk7kgUBhXhVu-9vHg Nearer the west end of Rose street lies this minute Mexican restaurant. Here you'll find all the typical Mexican fare: Quesadillas, Enchiladas, Fajitas etc. Beers include Dos Equis, Negra Modelo et al. Fairly standard so far...

Where the Cantina Mexicana aims to differentiate itself from its competition is the specials. The Borrego con meil (a slow cooked lamb dish with a honey/chilli sauce) and Cazuela (a chicken and Chorizo casserole) are both delicious and highlight the value of choosing something a little different as appose to the 'usuals'. 

Backing all this up is the cost: it's wallet friendly prices (£7 for the afore mentioned specials) ensure a solid dining experience.  

Be sure to book or get in there early at the weekend as it will be rammed!
