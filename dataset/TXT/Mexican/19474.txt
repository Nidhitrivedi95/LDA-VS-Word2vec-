Prices are reasonable and you won't be disappointed. Try out the pink Cadillac margarita and lots and lots of gauc. Felipe was our server he was very knowledgeable and made great recommendations! The manager Stacy was also very sweet and made it a point to make sure we were taken care of. Definitely will be revisiting when we come back to Vegas, it was the best food we had out of our whole trip.
