TCoBE_BkDRrK0bWrh5VueQ This is the type of place my coconut Mexican friend would create. He was loving the decor and loud music...not the type of music though, he wanted club stuff but I was pleased to listen to Peter Bjorn and John playing :-) I really like the look of the place very yuppie gringo. The tables are clean and so was the salsa bar. There was even a upstairs area which I didn't even realize until I left the restaurant and saw the stairs in the window. 

I had to try the Alpastor since that's my favorite and serves as a good bench mark. I had two with all the fixings, pineapple and all. I liked the pineapple on it but the sauce was so spicy I couldn't get the flavor of the Alpastor. I'll probably come back and try it again without the sauce but most likely go to the E. Tropicana location to see how they do it, word on the streets is their food is slightly better. Maybe it's all the gringo ambiance at this location, lack of authentic feel created a perception that effected my taste buds this wasn't the biz. Most likely it was the way too hot of sauce though :-/ 

Taco El Gordo still reign supreme ;-) but I'll come here for the cool music.
