G6BwYw_0_atLPTzI1uokIA Went to Nacho Daddy for a work event and it was amazing! The food was delicious I literally ate until I couldn't breath anymore lol. My excuse was I'm eating for 2! ;) Unfortunately, I was not able to try the cocktails because I'm 41/2 months pregnant but I got to witness my boss and a couple of coworkers do the Scorpion shot and that right there was a memorable evening.. It was a great experience and the service was so incredible I would definitely recommend this location. Thank you so much Debra for your wonderful hospitality and you will be seeing us again soon!
