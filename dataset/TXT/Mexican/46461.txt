7rpa12_EX3A-hyGtrv8o3A Excellent food and service. Great value and good ambiance. Fish tacos were awesome.
Great Mexican beer. Our party thoroughly enjoyed it. Authentic food. The tacos reminded me of real tacos in DF that we used to have by the metro station. Separate bills was no issue and much appreciated.
