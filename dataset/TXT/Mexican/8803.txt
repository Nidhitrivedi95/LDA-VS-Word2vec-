_u1Bq7QsgMUXSMex8QHqLQ Good burrito,  not great.  Reviews are over rated,  the place is great for midnight after club food but I wouldn't go here if I want a GREAT burrito.  It's a nice quick fix.  They don't have much meat options (ex flavoured chickens or flavoured meats)  

I would come back if I was craving burrito specifically,  but wouldn't be first choice burrito place either.
