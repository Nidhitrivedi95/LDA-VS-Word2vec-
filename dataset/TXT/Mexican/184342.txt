Ns20WGWn6s6niKAGIQB4UQ Went for the first time with my daughter before the Kris Allen/Parachute show. We had a great time and we were so surprised at the delicious food at a concert venue! My favs were the Tinga Chicken tacos and the fabulous bean dip. To top of off, we tried the "bag of donuts." As we were devouring the fresh-fried mini-donuts with Nutella, we both decided, even if the meal hadn't been great (which it was) it would have been worth coming just for the donuts! 

Had a vacation day on Friday and I couldn't think of any place I'd rather take my husband than back to the Crescent Ballroom so he could enjoy it, too. When I come back within a few days, it has to be good! 

Concert was great as well, especially my fav Kris Allen!
