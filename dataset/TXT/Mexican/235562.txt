SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA This place is amazing! This was our 1st time here and our server, Chris, was awesome. We started off with house chips/bean dip/salsa green & red).... we ordered the fajitas for 2 and it was sooo delicious! It was more then enough for the both of us. The service was excellent ! We would highly recommend this restaurant...one of the best (if not the best) Mexican restaurants we've dined in.
