Rv4aYEKmRsLrijjtq5CS5Q I premise this by saying I'm from San Diego, and grew up on having Mexican food weekly, I've even had it in Mexico plenty of times; and this place just doesn't do it for me. 

We live close by and saw the place and decided to try it out. We only ordered (2) Carne Asada burritos to see how the food was. My boyfriend said his wasn't too bad, but I wasn't a fan. My burrito was really wet and it had refried beans in with the carne asade (as well as the pico de gallo, etc). It also lacked any real seasoning, and the salsas we put on our burritos just had heat to them, without any flavor. 

The menu is limited to tacos, burritos, tortas, and nachos for the most part. Since I love mexican food and we live close by, we will prob try it again -- definitely be trying something different and hopefully it will be worth my while. Beware of the rave reviews from other people, if they've never had great, real mexican food, well... ignorance is bliss.
