FI7RsrAxVdiDEuSKlYql1w It is as good as it needs to be.  Food is consistently good, but nothing will blow you away.  It fills the void that Chi-Chi's left so many years ago.  Food comes out extremely quick and extremely hot, so much so that I fear they may be giving the plates some "radar love" in the back.  Have eaten there many times and will go back.  Friendly staff and gimmicky décor.
