pwablDuLsQOdpHAEcNFtww We had lunch here today and we will be back. The decor is very attractive and our server, Josiah, was great. We're both vegetarians and Josiah was helpful in  making suggestions that fit the bill. 

My wife ordered the avocado enchiladas with Ranchera sauce. She enjoyed her meal, but she did say she would order the crema sauce next time. I ordered the avocado enchiladas with crema sauce and it is a new favorite. Interestingly, the avocado enchiladas aren't made with tortillas. They're actually made using crepes, which made them delicate and light.  The papas are indescribably good and the black beans we substituted were fresh and tasty. Josiah made sure the black beans were vegetarian-friendly, which we really appreciated. 

The meal was capped off with some of the best flan I've ever had. Be sure to leave room for it.
