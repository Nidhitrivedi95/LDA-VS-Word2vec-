wvlF1x7Cm8UGu6iD0LgIJw Super nice staff, awesome burrito, and great price! This was a nice surprise to find at the airport because I was starving and didn't feel like paying a million dollars for half of a crappy sandwich with very little meat on it. I'd highly recommend for a guy who is looking for a high protein meal that's under ten bucks at the airport.
