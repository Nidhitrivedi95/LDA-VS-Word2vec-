Rj-7ymdw8aNZBRqGRAjR3Q I was a little disappointed in this place. I came here for lunch with a group of coworkers. I ordered the vegetarian quesadilla. The quesadilla didn't have much cheese at all and was VERY spicy. The serving portion was super small even got an appetizer. I wasn't impressed with the quality of food for what I paid for. The fajitas looked good but not sure if it would be worth $20. Maybe if I came for happy hour and got appetizers and drinks it would be worth it. I wouldn't recommend coming here expecting authentic Mexican food. Service was good and decor was nice. Maybe I'll try again later.
