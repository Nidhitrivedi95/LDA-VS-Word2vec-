YkOCo5ipV2he2WXIAlZb-A Finally got to try some sushi burritos & glad that we went here!
The service was friendly & helpful. I got the Long Beach burrito wrapped in soy paper & despite it having guacamole (which I usually can't stand) - it tasted amazing! My mom had the Kodiak sushi burrito wrapped in soy paper. She loved her's as well. We both enjoyed our food a lot & would love to go again. We wish there was a location closer to where we live but we know that the trip is worth it for the food either way!
