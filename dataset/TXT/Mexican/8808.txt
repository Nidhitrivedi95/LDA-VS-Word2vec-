Never heard of this place for my first couple of years in Toronto, but an old co-worker in 2009 mentioned it was a great place for lunch take-out downtown.  We went at the busy lunch hour and waited probably half an hour in a huge crowd, like we were fighting for concert tickets or something.  lol  I got the chicken burrito with everything on it and fell in love from the first visit.  

So big!  Even the small size is big.  So fresh and delicious.  You order in one line, keep your receipt, then they call out your receipt number to customize your burrito or quesadilla as you like (like Subway), then wait again for them to grill it.  Very casual atmosphere.  Well known for the after club drunk scene.  lol

If you go during "off" hours, eg mid-afternoon, the wait won't be so long.  And depending on the location, you may get a table to eat it there.  Some just have stools by the window, etc.  I now go to the Queensway location 90% of the time b/c it's close to home.  Average 10 minute wait.  I actually love waiting for it.  The smell of the place makes my mouth water.  

I've recently become vegetarian so now order the veggie soy burrito, which looks like ground beef.  It's fine.  I'd still prefer the chicken, but this totally satisfies, hence me still going there just as often.

I'd love to look into franchising a location of this place, that's how much I love it.  Maybe someday....
