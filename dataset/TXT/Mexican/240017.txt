T2tEMLpTeSMxLKpxwFdS3g 100% my favorite spot in Charlotte. 

The food is great, I've had so many of the menu items--and I've never complained about anything. My number one favorite is the Tav-a-Roo tacos, but again, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Mix and match the tacos to try different flavors, I also recommend the baja rice for a side. 

They have great drink specials and a full margarita list to choose from. When you sit down, they'll serve you chips and corn salsa...you're going to want more! 

The servers are always great, the atmosphere is fun and laid-back. Absolutely recommend it!
