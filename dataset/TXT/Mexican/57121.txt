a8pmtlVKf7NiSLI-4KejIw Love the atmosphere here. Great music, service and decent food.  This is the perfect place to have drinks with friends on the patio on a nice sunny day. If you are coming during dinning hours, expect a minimum 30 mins wait.  They don't take reservations for their patio, its first come first serve. If you want to make reservations for prime dinning time, you need to book at least 2 weeks in advance. 
 
For food, we ordered the guac, shrimp mango salad, tuna watermelon cerviché, corn on the Cobb, baja fish tacos and shrimp lobster tacos.  Everything is edible but nothing really stood out to me. 

The service on the hand was fantastic. Our server was super friendly and efficient. She accommodated all of our requests which is the only reason why I gave it a 4 star as oppose to 3.
