OPcGFLP_mRt9yvgP3ALXOQ I love this place! It's very family-friendly. They make guacamole and other dishes right at your table. The queso with sausage is delish! And the drinks are great too. My only complaint is the music. They have the same loop on every time we go and much of it Colombian music, not Mexican. Would love if they'd spice it up a bit.
