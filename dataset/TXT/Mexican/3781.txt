-PKUAor_Nz_IaNjP_jIwyA I must say, the first time we went here in an extremely large group we had quite a negative experience. 
However, Hacienda more than redeemed itself with our next visit!
Was absolutely amazing from start to finish! The ceviche, faloutas, jerk lobster tacos, pollo tinga, la truck, braised short rib were all beyond delicious. And of the course, the churro poutine was the perfect ending! My personal favorite, the jerk lobster taco! May be too spicy for some, but I loved it!
Will definitely be back again, very soon!
