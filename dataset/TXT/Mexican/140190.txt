The tacos are alright except the portions are pathetically small. It's a joke for $9. 

Floor is very slippery 

Music was way too loud 

Servers are in need of more training and/or experience 

Chips were very salty 

I would take Barrio or even Chipotle over Paco Taco's any day. Both are much more tasty and generous.
