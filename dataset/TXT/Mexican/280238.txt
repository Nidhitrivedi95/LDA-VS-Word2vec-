I settled on three things though, the philly cheesesteak (pretty good but a little dry and not huge), the French fries with hot sauce and cheese on them (not my favorite as the fries got soggy), and hot wings (probably my favorite thing I got but they didn't seem to have sauce on them.  Still tasty though!).  I would go back here to try a lot more of their items just because it is so accessible and cheap and not bad honestly.
