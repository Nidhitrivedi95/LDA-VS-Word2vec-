OD09pm-MzynigAvD5KoGPA We ate here last evening based on the overly positive Yelp reviews. The food was fantastic, and it must be the recipes, because we have never tasted anything quite like it. We tried the 5 street taco dish with various meats (green chilies so nice), the shrimp quesadilla, and even sampled a chicken taco as an after meal treat. The tortilla chips are made fresh and go wonderfully well with the jalapeno cream cheese!
