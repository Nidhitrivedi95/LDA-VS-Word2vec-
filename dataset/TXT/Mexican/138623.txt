izNFwY0XMPsmmUDaSzB9ig I've been to Sabor numerous times since they opened the location in FM/Tega Cay. Fresh and tasty food - a welcome alternative to the ubiquitous Tex-Mex chains and franchises. Managing the lines during lunch still seems to be a challenge as it can take longer than reasonably expected. Nonetheless, a welcomed addition to the area. Will be back many more times.
