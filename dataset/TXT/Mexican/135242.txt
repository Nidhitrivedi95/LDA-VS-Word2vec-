IMoMOGoIDabx_Gnkw4-mmg So we went in for a Mother's Day dinner. My food was fine, as was my husbands, but my sisters was not. She ordered fajitas. Her side plate with the guacamole, beans and rice came out first. Her meat came about 5 minutes later after the rest of us were well into our meals(she gave permission for us to start before her so we could eat warm food), she then had to request her tortillas. When those finally came she assembled her first portion, and her last. The meat was flavorless and she couldn't eat it. When she spoke to the waiter about it the response was the equivalent of go fuck yourself. She had to pay $14.99 for a meal she sent back. So my advice is if you want super average food and a big fuck you if you don't like your meal ,this is the spot. Also, there are a ton of turkey vultures circling overhead which we should have seen as an omen in retrospect. So folks, there are plenty of other places in that area, so I suggest going elsewhere. Happy Mother's Day to us!
