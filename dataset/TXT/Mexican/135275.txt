IMoMOGoIDabx_Gnkw4-mmg Travelling here on business I thought I would stop by for dinner to see what Mexican food tastes like in Ohio. Having lived in Texas for the past 8 years I guess I am spoiled. I ordered the shrimp fajitas. The flour tortillas where a little hard and the food lacked taste. I was surprised since it came with a lot of vegetables on the sizzling platter but for some reason they lacked taste. Chips and salsa were also average. Service was average to good. Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad. I just think it only deserves 3 stars.
