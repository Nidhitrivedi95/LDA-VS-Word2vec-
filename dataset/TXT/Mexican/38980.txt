6AYMdVnWkFWTk1uEHGUmZg atmosphere is amazing but the beers are expensive! I ordered a bucket of beer bc it's cheaper that way but boy was i wrong! $6 per bottle! I could not believe it. If i would have known i would have pre-gamed at my place. The waiters are nice but I didnt like the way they were dressed, they seemed as though they had just finished cleaning their house-sucky ponytail, shorts and a t-shirt. However, There was a live mariachi for two hours which was ok but they didnt  know two songs i requested which really disappointed me. If i ever go again, it will only be for the free mariachi.
