c6lzPktduqtKqRSnX_CUTg So , I went there early to meet with my girlfriends , I was actually super early and decided to seat at the bar , the 2 bartenders were super nice and offer water ( 2 kinds of water. Once the rest of the party got to the restaurant we decided to order right away the server was super nice and did an excellent Job ! We drove her crazy with split checks but she handle it super good ( 11 of us ) . The only reason why I am giving 4 stars is because the food took forever, and the portions are super small for the price. But besides from that the Flamenco was awesome !!! Thank you for having us.
