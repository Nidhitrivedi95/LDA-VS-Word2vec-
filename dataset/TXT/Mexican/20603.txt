27oxCPhgCaylA0U23r2O2g What's an ASIAN doing in a mexican grocery store...

I 
Come
Here 

For.... THE PASTEL DE TRES LECHES!

Mi gusta MUCHISIMO the pastel de tres leches!

I cannot find this anywhere else in this town.. Marianas is a conveint mexican gorcery store and you can find all the mexican ingredients here.. From takis to marias cookies im sure you can find everything you need here for a mexican fiesta!

 But i am mostly here for the pastel de tres leches.. try now! they have it in fruit, strawberry, and chocolate flavor..


For my birthday i had them custom make this cake it cost me about 80$ but well worth it if you wanted something different and wanted to impress your friends... I know to the mexican world this cake is probably normal..  But if you ever see this place dont be scared walk right in and grab that cake! Everyone is pretty polite and helpful there!
