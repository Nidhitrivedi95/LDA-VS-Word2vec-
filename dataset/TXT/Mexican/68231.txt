bjbegGikWzSgeVsOJdE22g I keep seeing people saying this place is like Que Tal was. Guess what? It's BETTER than Que Tal seeing as I have never had (or known anyone who had) food poisoning from Chili Peppers! Prices are fair, interesting people watching in the dining room. The burrito is excellent for a case of the munchies. Dude has been in the neighbourhood forever and that counts for something with me.
