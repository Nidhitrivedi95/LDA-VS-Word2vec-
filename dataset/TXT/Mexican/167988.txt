lv5Bnqlt93NnvNJ2oNcQ8Q I took my staff there for Admin lunch today. I was very disappointed, we work down the street from this location. First of all we had to wait 45 minutes to get our lunch. That is way too long, their excuse was they had a huge party. The weird thing is the people who sat after us got their food first. 

I was ok with this, but then I received my shrimp cocktail that was mixed with octopus and there was no octopus. Finally the manager came over and gave us the whole excuse about another large party taking up their time and he apologized. I told him about my missing octopus and he said we don't have octopus its shrimp and fish. I said no look at your menu. It said octopus and he said sorry this is an old menu from Texas. He just gave me the impression that I was taking up his time and did not care about us.  He offered me a dessert and I asked the other two girls if they wanted it. They each ordered something. A few minutes later the waitress showed up with one fried ice cream for the three of us. Oh and it only had one fried ice cream ball. When I looked up the yelp reviews, it comes with two! Really you only give me one ice cream ball? I don't deserve the other one? Jerk!

Our waitress was so sweet and I could tell she felt bad. She made our bad visit a little brighter and she actually cared.
