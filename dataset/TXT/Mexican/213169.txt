QUxzvPrcWSXCKtYcneXIVA I'm at Red Rock almost every Wednesday night.  Not because it's Senior Night - I'm way too young for that ;).  It's my night to be out alone, without a non-gambler looking over my shoulder.  Not that I'm a high roller, far from it.  After all, I eat dinner at the food court.  And for the last three Wednesdays, my place of choice has been Rubio's.  I've had the same dish each time:  the Chicken-Quinoa-Lime bowl.

With lots of chicken, black beans, quinoa, brown rice and, whoa - a ton of sliced almonds - in addition to a few other goodies, this dish can't be beat.  It is such a huge portion that I can't even think of it as being healthy; there's just too much of it, and I don't stop when I'm full.  But it sure is delicious.

I've had other terrific things at Rubio's in the past - their chicken with balsamic veggies is another favorite - but as long as they keep offering the quinoa I'm gonna keep on ordering it.  And there's even a $2 discount for checking in on Yelp.  Way to go, Rubio's.
