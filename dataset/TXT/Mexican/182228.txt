nHdsHdq35JflGzliWVqG-Q The BEST burritos in Charlotte! 
I've been to Phat burrito, Chipotle, Qdoba, Salsarita's, etc.

Everything is fresh and basically build your burrito however you want.
You've gotta try the Ground Beef and Green Tomatillo Chicken combo! (Beef and Green)
Top it off with a Virgil's Cream soda. Mmmmmmm delicious.

If you hit a line, no worries, it moves fast.
