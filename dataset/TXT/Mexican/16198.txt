1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w Muy bien! In a town with more Mexican restaurants per capita than Tijuana, Cabo's certainly stands out above the rest. The decor is way better than El Toro or Dos Reales and I don't get the feeling that I might get salmonella at all. 

Dos XX Ambar on draft
Bad Ass Pork Tacos
Chicken Enchiladas
Delicious rice with corn in it

It loses one star for just ok service. Some confusion with the wait staff and kitchen. Other than that the experience was excellent. Way to go Cabo's!
