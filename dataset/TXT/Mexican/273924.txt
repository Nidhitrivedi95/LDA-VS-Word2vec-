x3LoVFuzVIPK_J-kDZORdg My BFF and I have come here multiple times a month for the last several months, admittedly usually on Tuesdays. But even if I celebrate a Taco Tuesday every now and again, I always make sure to add other things to my order, because hogging a table for $4 isn't great. I also tip at least 20%, and if I'm getting tacos, that's based on the original price, not the $1 Tuesday price.

Anyway, on Tuesdays it can be pretty busy, but it's real slow during the week, and that's a shame. I'm always telling people how good it is in the Plaza Midwood Facebook group, but they always want to list other places. IDK man. 

They always give us extra chips and salsa too and that's good because we are fatties. I always get some queso. The hot salsa is too hot for me, but I'm a whimp. Even people I know who aren't whimps, like my BFF, need to mix it sometimes. Don't feel bad if you can't do it by itself. Or do, I can't tell you how to live your life.

Also a medium margarita is giant and wonderful. 

Today we had Ron and he was super attentive and nice. He kept us all filled up on our food and was always there right before we needed him. He's got a great personality, like most of the wonderful people who work there. 

Anyway, go to La Unica.
