PjhIQJf2dbdLxgnFrAUaNw When we went there was only 2 young men working. They were the greeters, servers and busboys. Now I wonder if they were the cooks too. The bf & I ordered from the lunch menu. He ordered combo #1 which comes with 2 items and he chose a chicken flauta & a chicken taco. I chose combo #3 and selected a cheese enchilada, chicken flauta & a beef taco. It also came with a choice of the soup of the day, salad or rice & beans. We both decided to give the fideo soup a try since it was the soup of the day. While we waited we were given chips and salsa which were tasty. We also ordered the guacamole which was also pretty good.  I have to say though that I was very disappointed in the fideo soup. I love soup, and it didn't taste like any fideo soup I've ever had before. I don't understand how you can mess up fideo soup?? a I'm usually forgiving, it's just to bad my taste buds aren't.
