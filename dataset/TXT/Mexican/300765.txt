ZoCCW3R_LEAzktU0rMbX8w A few weeks ago I had dinner at this location with a friend we ordered and came to the cashier I asked for lemons and she looked behind and said oh there's none anymore I love lemon on my food so I class very disappointed she didn't even offer to go to the back and get some so I sat down and about 2 mins later comes David with a great smile and amazing customer service asked if everything was okay and is there anything we needed so I asked him for lemons but a smile he said oh that's easy no problem a minute later comes David with cut lemons he went back there and cut himself . That's what I call great customer service ! You turn my frown upside down thank you!
