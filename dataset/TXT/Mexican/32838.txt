4Pb7SlTK89uSdqOwMNM35A food was ok but I had the worst service from the bar. I was advised I couldn't order from the room but I could come down in order at the bar from the front.

ok..no problem

I get to the bar and try to order a burger for my dad ,he ordered the previous night and wanted the same burger  again. 

I go to the bar and ask Ericka the bartender if she could help me with finding this burger on the menu.

I describe it and I ask about a sauce that came with it  .


Ericka was so rude. she clearly did not want to help , she actually would not, and  honestly seemed like she was underlying racist.

I say this because I watched her interact with others at the bar .. she was much more friendly. 

she talked to me like she was annoyed to deal with me and I only asked for help with my order. i was not rude..i did not have an additude. i remained polite.  

she was not polite at all.

I come to Vegas and Ballys all the time. It is like a second home

My parents are diamond members here.

I have never been treated so badly by someone in service at a restaurant.

I did finally get someone to help me who was very nice and showed no problem helping me Robert i  believe.

also note: I did not drink so i was not coming in drunk and obnoxious like most people do in vegas.

I hope Ericka and Ballys management reads this.

someone needs some emotional intelligence training.

how can you be in service and unwilling to help and pretend to have little knowledge of the menu?

I'm just saying.
