4w3CXzYFboPjsjDHIXyVLg I would imagine a lot of people would say they could eat this everyday.  Its so good.  The rice is perfect and the burrito's are pretty big.  I recommend you stop at one and give it a try.  I sometimes love to order the Burrito Bowl and then ask for hard shell taco's on the side and make my own taco out of the bowl.  Or break the taco's up and use them as nachos to scoop up the food.........
