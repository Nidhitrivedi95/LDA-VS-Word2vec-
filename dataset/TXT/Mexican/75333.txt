CISwejdbG96MIv1nndQ3Ng So Today was my lucky day!
I was driving to work and forgot my lunch 
Not in the mood for mall food court lunch 
Drove past some construction and saw this sign , crossed my fingers it was authentic and made the right turn
Boy was I in luck
For starters the place is super clean and organized. The owners are extremely friendly as well , very welcoming and genuine
They knew it was our first time there and helped us decide, and while we waited for our food(fresh to order empanadas)
She gave us free churros to snack on I was wowed. BEST churros I've ever had, crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside perfect amount of powdered sugar and chocolate or dulce de leche inside.
Then to top it off her husband arrived and offered us Cuban espresso to try. I was so overwhelmed w the clear love they have for their customers and pride in their food.
I ordered 10 empanadas cause I mean I obviously have to try all of them lol.
My fav is the Columbian style beef/potato one was soo delicious
I definitely will be back for a Burrito and home made chips/dip
They even have a Salsa station with homemade salsa spicy or mild which was soooo good
