sAu9UJ5tvY6sc9Q_gcVV7Q Great Mexican food, I'll definitely be back. I ordered a number 52: shredded beef chimichanga enchilada style with beans and rice.

The chimichanga was huge, lightly fried, and covered with enchilada sauce and cheese. It was not greasy how some chimis can be. I was pleasantly surprised by how tasty the shredded beef was. It was perfectly cooked, lightly seasoned and very tender. Very generous portion of meat that you can cut with a fork.

The pinto beans were good and had a pork flavor. The rice had a great taste and was very fresh.

We received a complimentary order of chips and roja, verde and pico sauces.

Great place!
