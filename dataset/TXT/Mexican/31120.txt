4ggOHxvlxnF0a00hDDVbnQ I have patronized Sunny Jims countless times.  From live bands to Steeler Games.. it's always a good time!  The food is always on point.  I have never been disappointed with anything I have ordered.  The menu offers a large variety of items - from Ribs to even Pizza.  The dining room is always packed.  Since the renovation new tables have been added so there is even more seating available.  During my recent visit - yesterday I tried the "Ginger Mambo Habanero" smoked wings.  They were delicious -Not "hot" at all - sweet and tangy.  My favorite time to visit the restaurant is for Steeler Games.. always fun and always great specials.  Thanks Sunny Jims!!  See you again real soon
