Kcg5iMwYq5ibBuEhDXKx3Q Great Mexican place! Cheap and cheerful.

Went a while back and had the daily special and the corn on the cobb.

Special was great but smothered in sauce, made a mental note to ask for it on the side next time. The corn was fantastic though, covered in Mayo and paprika - they only way to eat it if you ask me.

They also have flavoured frozen margaritas. I'm not a big cocktail drinker but that stops when there are frozen margaritas. 

If I lived in Edinburgh (sigh) I know I'd be a regular. Impressive place considering how far Mexico is from Scotland
