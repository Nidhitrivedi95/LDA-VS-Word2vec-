fY79hLjygu4zMtzE67Y4Xw Started off not knowing what I wanted. Workers weren't very helpful in offering suggestions and just stared at me like I was stupid. I decided to get a chicken bowl. Again, the servers weren't very pleasant while I was ordering.
The bowl it's self was very disappointing. The rice was actually so undercooked and hard that I took it back to exchange for a quesadilla. The cashier kept trying to offer me another bowl instead, but I didn't want anything with rice. I offered to pay the difference, but she said she would ask the manager if it was possible.
The manager/supervisor was very pleasant and offered right away to exchange it for me. The quesadilla was delicious! Going forward, I think I'll just stick with Chipotle.
