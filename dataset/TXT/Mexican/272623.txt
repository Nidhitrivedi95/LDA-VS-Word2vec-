WVAvGK24DQ9FdsEHBqIygQ I moved to Canada from San Diego CA, the homeland of Mexican food in American, and  I never thought I'd be able to have real Mexican food again without traveling 3.000 miles... that is until our dinner at Mi Taco Taqueria!  The flavours are very authentic, and delicious.  The staff is so friendly and helpful that it felt like we were regular customers not a first timers.  Our group had fish, carne asada, brisket and chicken tacos, a carne asada burrito bowl and a carne asada burrito.  You can tell that the tortillas are homemade, and the all the ingredients are fresh.   They also sell several types of hot sauce, I almost cried when I saw my beloved Tapatio!!  Our teenage nephew is the MOST picky eater I have ever seen, he only eats about three things, we made him try the brisket tacos and he fell in love!  If Mi Taco can sway that kid, the power of their food strong!  We are often in TO, and will be there next for FanExpo - I see me eating there every single day!!!  p.s.  Mmmmmm, those beans!!
