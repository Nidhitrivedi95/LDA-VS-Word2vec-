pomGBqfbxcqPv14c3XH-ZQ Great place for higher quality Mexican food in the northwest.  I have been here a few times and the dishes are consistently traditional and flavorful. 

Service starts with chips and salsa both a red and green along with refried beans for dipping. All three are  delicious and made fresh in house. The tortilla chips that accompanied  the salsas are also delicious.

Menu prices are a little high I feel but the portions and quality help to justify the price point. Daily specials that highlight traditional mexican home style dishes are very good. I had the Bisteque  and it was very good.  Tender beef with potatos, corn, peppers, and onions in a thick gravy like sauce was very good. I really enjoyed the white rice and beans. The white rice was prepared with sour cream and roasted peppers....Amazing! 

One of the best parts of the meal was the free Margarita with the Yelp check in. It's always good to be a member of the club. Great beverage. 

Enjoy!
