h9pEt23IAyjBtUaYA9v46A My friend and I decided to venture out and try this restaurant because we had seen the rave reviews and delicious looking pictures. When we arrived, it seemed to be a little sketchy because of the area, but trust me, the food is amazing. We ordered one shrimp burrito and 5 street style tacos (I chose to do 1 of each kind) and a large horchata to share. Let me tell you, it was soo bomb. We had to wait at least 10 minutes, but we could see the chefs prepare it through the see through window. They were very thorough and very friendly. When the food came, the presentation was so beautifully done and you can tell they put a whole lot of effort. The horchata was probably also one of the best I've ever drank. 

All in all, I hope to return again and try out more of their menu!
