vrSJPjntzfCPgogFPSCHiA I'm a fan of this place. It is clean and friendly service.  The prices are great and the food quality far surpasses El Campesino where I will never return again.  My husband gets a dish that I don't have a clue how to spell -- Chilequiles or something like that.  He says it's the best he's ever had.  We've been back a few times and will continue to return.  The location, I fear, may lead to their demise...it's so tucked away beside Walmart that it doesn't get much random traffic.  That said, they stay pretty busy!
