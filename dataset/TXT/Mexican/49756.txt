8PBq-MHyLDrhkaTf72Foww Don't bother with this place. The service was excellent,  but the food was horrid and far out weighted the service. The rice was so bad that I later realized it had chipped a tooth. The experience led to the relegation as to why the restaurant is named "dos gringos," I had a bout of Montezuma's revenge, which would've conquered any Spanish Conquistador.
