A complimentary small dessert of white chocolate-stuffed corn husks was a very nice surprise. I was too full to "unlock" the dessert listed here on Yelp and, so my friendly server, Cheryl, suggested I come back for it later - I think I'll take her up on that offer, because Happy Hour looks great!  :-)
