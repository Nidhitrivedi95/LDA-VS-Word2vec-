MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA These aren't traditional tacos so let's just start by removing the scoop of carne asada, shredded lettuce, pico de gallo idea from your head.  All gone?  Good.  

OK, let's get down to it.  Now we can talk about the creative magnificence that is the Grand Electric taco.  

It's a perfectly balanced dish delivered on a small flour tortilla.  I tried the chips and guac (tasty, fresh), the beef cheek taco (tender), and the fish taco (fried but not greasy). 

Summary: The food is tasty.  The place is noisy.  The wait to get in is really long.
