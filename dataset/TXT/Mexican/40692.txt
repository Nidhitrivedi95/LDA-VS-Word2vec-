6Ve_2kEz18dvhp4q3M5I2Q Today is the 4th time I've been here. Today my food came out really quick, it tasted fresh. Today I got a Carne asada burrito with beans, cheese, onions, cilantro and rice. It was pretty good but I was not absolutely blown away.

The only two concerns I have had here are it sometimes takes them a little while before someone acknowledges that you're there, and my second gripe is they never have any Pico DE Gallo . I've eaten so much Mexican food growing up in Los Angeles and even travelling to Mexico several times and I never see a place without it.
