He brought water, chips and salsa within 5 minutes, he took orders and we got them about 10 minutes later. Thomas was great he was working several tables and the place was full because of the concert. 

The Shrimp Taco Special had a decent amount of shrimp, it wasn't greasy just a nice combo of Mexican spices/sauce, shrimp, cabbage, and cheese.  Other things on the plate: rice, black beans (very small amount) and a small mixed salad. Overall it was a good meal and service.
