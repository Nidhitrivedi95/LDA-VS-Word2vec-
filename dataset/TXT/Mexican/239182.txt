T0dN9-NfwF_YD2fSQRu9AQ I have celiac disease and I am extremely sensitive to cross contamination. Because of that I rarely go out to eat.  My gluten sensitive daughter took me to Gus' Cafe for brunch. While the food took a little while to prepare, once it came out it was obvious that is was made from scratch. The gluten free caramel apple waffles were crispy and moist. The cinnamon caramel apples were fresh and delicious.  It was well worth the wait!  No corners were cut. My daughter's dish was also perfect and delicious. All the food was piping hot and the service was good. I will make the 70 minute drive to return often and I will bring my gluten-loving husband with me. There were many very intriguing non-GF dishes available as well. Ten thumbs up!
