SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA I love this place! So to start off food is amazing, I always get full off of the chips and salsa! I got their street tacos the other day, which were great! Also, tried their fajitas which they are known for and has exceeded my expectations. Secondly, I love how they are a "family style" restaurant. You might have one server but if you need anything else, the others will be sure to help! Will go back again and again.
