Definitely some very cool interior design happening, matches the vibe of the restaurant and the type of food served. The service was excellent. The wait staff would come check up to make sure everything was good, water glasses were filled without being asked.

Tapa style Mexican food, everything is designed for sharing. The guacamole was served fresh table side, with the server pounding on a stone mortar and pestle. The scallops were amazing, a must try ! They were seared perfectly and the flavour of the corn was just right, it was spicy but not too strong to overpower the natural taste of the scallops. The rest of the food ordered were average and not too special. The pastor taco had a charcoal flavour to the meat which overpowered everything else. A bit on the dry side, was expecting some sweet pineapple to balance out the meat but couldn't taste it at all.

Overall, would come here again for the atmosphere. Would like to sit outside near the big fire pit on a warm night. More towards 3.5 stars for El Catrin.
