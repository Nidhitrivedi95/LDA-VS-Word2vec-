Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg Being Mexican, my family and I always desire "homemade" Mexican food, specifically a place with fresh authentic beans. Coming from southern California we have pretty high standards when it comes to Mexican food. Lindo Michoacán did not disappoint! Some of the best Mexican, if not the best Mexican food I have tried in Las Vegas!
I made reservation for Saturday night at 7 pm. And when my family and I arrived the place was packed! As we waited for our table there was a live mariachi band for entertainment. We did not have to wait long to be seated, where our drink order was taken and chips salsa and, bean dip were placed on the table as an appetizer. Yum! Salsa was delicious and had a bit of heat and great chili flavor. The bean dip was my favorite, like I said you know a Mexican place is good if they make good beans! The chips were delicious as well and obviously homemade.
Service was friendly and prompt, even in the midst of a rush hour. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito wet, it was a generous portion and was very delicious. The wet sauce was tomato based which was delicious, however next time I will request the diablo sauce, which is more of an enchilada type sauce. My whole family enjoyed their dinner plates and all of the food looked delicious to me. I can't wait to try more on the menu!
