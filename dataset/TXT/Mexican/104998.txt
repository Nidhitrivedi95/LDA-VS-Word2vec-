FI-8LPGkc8D_hwx0l0zyyg Cool atmosphere but my friends and I were a bit disappointed with the food.  Before I complain though, I will say that the chips and guacamole were excellent.  Their chips are the thick, greasy kind that always tastes so good.  The guacamole "Blanco style" has cojita cheese in it and really was delicious!  

I had the Blanco Chopped Salad (achiote chicken, seasonal fruits, and pepitas) and found it pretty bland and boring.  (The achiote chicken salad at zTejas is much better.)  Others at the table had the cheese crisp with chicken and the green chile pork enchilada with chicken.  The cheese crisp was huge but nothing too exciting -- all the cheese and chicken seemed to be crammed into the middle, so the end pieces were mostly plain tortilla.  The enchilada with chicken was kinda weird -- it had this weird chewy pulled chicken.  We honestly couldn't even figure out if it was chicken or pork.  

The service was okay but it seemed like we constantly needed more water.  The glasses were too small and were filled with ice.  I'd probably come back here just for some chips, guac, and a drink.
