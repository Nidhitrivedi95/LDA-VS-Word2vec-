SUd3IyEN7n5OYEGyt_U5lg I walked in for my first time, about 20 mins before closing and the staff was incredibly friendly. Instead of just getting ready to close shop the owner came over and explained to me what type of meat they used and the history and the future plans of their business, as well as off topic small talk. I appreciated the convo while waiting for my order.I already can't wait to come back and I haven't even tasted the food yet. Great customer service.
