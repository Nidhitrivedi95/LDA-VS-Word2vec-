Q28MO9hEMyG0xrAnOF-dSw I have been to several comedy clubs and this is the best by far.  The headliners are consistently hilarious, they never push drinks on u, service is good and there are no bad seats .  Easy parking, adjacent restaurant is yummy and convenient plus intimate showtoom too.  Howard is very personable.  He personally greets regulars and newbies alike.  Go there and u will go again and again.  A great place to look forward to visiting at the end of a long work week.  Check out these great reviews. No other club rates as well and other places charge more and often provide less satisfying entertainment.  Great value and a superb quality product.  This is the best place.....period.
