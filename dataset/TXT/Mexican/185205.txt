While waiting we were told "The kitchen is backed up. It will be another 30 minutes." Really? I've never heard this before at ANY other restaurant except this one! This was the second time this had happened to us here. Lots of angry customers. The dining room was half empty before they started dating people again. Any kitchen should be able to run a full restaurant on a busy night! Done with this place.
