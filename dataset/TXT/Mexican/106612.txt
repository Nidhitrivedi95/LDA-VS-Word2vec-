fL2vdjn-ApNcsVntxtg4Dg Both Fuego steakhouse and amigos cantina give great service and good food.  Trying out all the station casinos accommodations and for 50 bucks a night it wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad either.   The walls are thin so  be careful not to be too nosy but all in all... Great stay!
