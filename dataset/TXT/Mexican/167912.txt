luOWGdtAfsbrZ5kC_cjuYA We returned to AZ Kitchen Monday afternoon. Only one other table occupied. Service was fast as would be expected. I had the #1 combo which is a cheese enchilada, shredded beef taco and bean tostada. The wife had a green chili burro enchilada style and a shredded beef taco. It was all great. We really love the place. Authentic Sonoran Mexican food that is presented perfectly! Doesn't have the atmosphere, but for a hole in the wall mom and pop place it is perfect! Lots of potential with some wall hangings etc.! A must stop if you are nearby or traveling the loop 101 in Peoria!
