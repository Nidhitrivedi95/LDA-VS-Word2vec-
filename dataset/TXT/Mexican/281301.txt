XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg This is Chef Bobby Flays signature restaurant. The restaurant opened before chef Flay sold his soul to food TV so the food, service and overall quality is still great and a great experience to dine here. Most of my visits are spontaneous so we had to wait a while to be seated but waiting at the bar is very pleasant. The food is great I recommend the blue corn tortilla and duck or blue corn lobster taco for starters and if you like steak it's great. They have extensive collection of wine and I have enjoyed some fine and expensive bottles. Service is great and friendly. I highly recommend this restaurant.
