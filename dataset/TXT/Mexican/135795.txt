INzLc1Y0JNQzIHjPH2Nbeg I odered the 2 taco plate w/ a soft corn tortilla grilled fish taco and a soft corn tortilla grilled shrimp taco. Both tacos were good, but the shrimp was my favorite. My plate also came with 2 sides, borracho beans (pinto beans cooked in beer w/ bacon) and cilantro-lime rice. The beans were pretty good, but I did add salt and hot sauce. The rice, however, tasted like it was straight from a box or a frozen dinner...it had a plastic taste and was just gross. I also had the chips and queso and those were the bomb diggity. They don't have a salsa bar, but their bottled hot sauce isn't bad.
The parking lot was really full, but they were pretty empty. The food came out quick and everyone was nice. The dinning room was pretty clean, but it was uncomfortably warm. 
They have a large selection of beer on tap, and some margaritas that I'll have to try on another occasion because I was on my lunch break.
