0FH5h58Qls1VIuXh5QORlg I always love eating at El Sol. Their guacamole is the best I've ever had, and almost everything else is well worth eating.

Basically, the food is great, the service is slow, and when they're busy, it's very slow. Good food can take time, but you might also find that you'll have trouble getting another drink while you're waiting, which isn't good for their bottom line.

If you're in a rush, you should probably not eat here at all, and if you want to make it as painless as possible, I'd suggest coming early. Still, the food is great, the drinks are pretty solid and the decor is fun. It's worth going, just go when you can afford to take the time.

They close for a month or so during the winter months sometime, so if you don't know when that is, you might be in for a surprise if you go and they're totally closed.
