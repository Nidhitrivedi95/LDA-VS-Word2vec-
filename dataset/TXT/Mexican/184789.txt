NSgSagwajv26iS8zUKs2EQ Came in w/ a large party last night for a business dinner. The staff was friendly & full of willingness to make sure our experience was a great one. Drinks & apps came out quick. The chips & salsa was adequate. We did order some Cadillac wings, which is the mildest of the 3 wing options. They do have a little quick w/ a whole lot of flavor. I myself ordered the combo fajitas platter (chicken, steak & shrimp). I requested hot sauce. None to my liking though. The young lady offered to get another kind from another restaurant within the casino. The food was great & everyone within our group was happy w/ their choices. Sadly they only offer 1 dessert. That dessert is Sopapias. Imagine donut triangles w/ chocolate, ice cream & whip cream. SO GOOD! Being a local I don't pop into a casino much to eat, but glad we did last night.
