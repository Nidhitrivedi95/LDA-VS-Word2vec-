eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg Cool little spot downtown. The parking is in the back of the building. The entire back of the building and walls surrounding are painted by artists and are very cool. You enter thru a little door as though being transported to Chicago at a little speakeasy. The tequila list all though great seems to have some hole as far as what's in stock or not. Being a serious tequila lover I was bummed that my first four picks weren't available. Got the table side gauc which was alright but I recommend getting it without the pomegranate seeds. The fish was just middle of the road alright but the traditional enchilada with the addition of churizo was killer!!!
