I3STZd5iAvUL9MNLF_DUug Extremely mediocre at best.  Prepackaged Guacamole was terrible and couldn't finish it. Had three tacos (green chile pork, chicken and carne asada). The pork was the best but all three were forgettable - tiny too. It's unfortunate that this airport hasn't figured out how to service a captive audience with decent food.
