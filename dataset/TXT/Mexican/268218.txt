WlBvw6R1Qe2yIaZp-2ilZA First off I'll start by saying our waiter was amazing! Johnny ran his butt off to make sure our table and all others surrounding were taken care of.
However.. The food was so-so.
Another issue we had was watching Johnny and his fellow server run around taking care of customers, however as the restaurant started to fill up, it would have been nice to see help from other work employees such as the two bartenders that stood around on the phone and playing with their hair. Team work is key when dinning in somewhere, if your server is busy, it wouldn't hurt to help run food and drinks.

3 stars all for Johnny!
