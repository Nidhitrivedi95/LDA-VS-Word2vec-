-Qkx7W0itbAApcG5lJuMFQ Jaburritos is an interesting concept that I wanted to try. I only eat chicken so I decided to try one of them that had the option. It was filling, but didn't have much taste to it. I only tasted the jalapeños not the sauces. I'm sure individuals who eat sushi and different meats may have a different experience. Definitely want to go back to make my own and see if it is any different.
