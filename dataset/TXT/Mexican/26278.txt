3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ Top places to eat when in Phoenix! More than something to eat, you get an experience because it's an old church building turned into a restaurant! And kudos to them for keeping the beauty of the church with the stain glass, pews and altar. The food is definitely up to par with the looks. They start you off with chips and 4 different salsas and of course-bottomless! We ordered the bacon jalapeño guac, a taco for each of us (al pastor), and their street corn. A must is their corn! My wife and I left stuffed, satisfied and will visit every time in town.
