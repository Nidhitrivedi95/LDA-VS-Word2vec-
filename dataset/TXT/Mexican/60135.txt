ak-f8IV0ZdDeI4oYnjA1Pw Love how late they are open (12 midnight for the dining area) &  I believe the drive-thru may be 24 hours? Minutes from LVAC by Flamingo / 215 so it is the perfect post workout meal. 

Quick, consistently good, and affordable mexican food. Last 2 times I went, I got the same things: #6 combo (chile relleno & cheese enchilada served with rice & beans) and a shrimp burrito. The shrimp is grilled not battered / fried so you don't feel too guilty. Salsa & veggies are always fresh and plentiful. I did share but devoured probably 75% of both (once was after my "beast mode" 2.5 hr upper & lower body workout and the other time was after lifting heavy leg day so the beasting on food post workout is justified IMO--GAINS!!).

I was starving / rushing last 2 times I came (around 10 or 11 PM) so I have yet to try redeeming the check in offer discount but please note there is one and let me know if it still works! Hopefully I remember to try next time...
