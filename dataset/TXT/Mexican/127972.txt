HwV2hQr7fbpiG8wODWJQ1w Ehhh I'm updating my review because I want to give them kudos to how well they handled the HUGE cinco de mayo crowd. My coworkers and I showed up around noon and the place was P - A - C - K - E - D. We were group of five and were able to be seated immediately.

Our waiter came to greet us and let us know there was a margarita special: order a margarita, get a free t-shirt. Unfortunately, the waiter failed to share that there was a price markup during the ordering process, but more on that later.

Two baskets of chips and salsa were brought out for the table and our food orders were placed. We plowed through both baskets of chips and salsa and another waiter kindly brought out two more baskets while we waited. Our food did seem to take a little longer than normal but it ended up being all right in the end. I went with the chicken carnitas lunch special and liked it, nothing great but good enough. 

Once it was time to cash out, my co-workers who'd placed margarita orders were shocked to see that the amount was $11-$12 for their drinks rather than the normal $8 or $9 for margaritas. Just would've been nice if the price increase would've been explained.

I went solo a few weeks later because I had a vicious craving for huevos rancheros. I was disappointed once my food came out because there wasn't much egg (huevo) to be found. I ordered the rancheros with chorizo and it was basically a plate filled of chorizo. The beans and rice were not that great and it was just, overall, not a good meal. I was very disappointed.

Can't say that I'll be going back anytime soon.
