J3YktOV6HCQYIVRU_lVZJA Yesterday was my first visit after November '15 when the Ecoli broke. I assumed that there is no such problem now. I was utterly wrong. I had a chicken bowl and it tasted the usual no problems there. But things got worse that evening and later that night. I was left completely dehydrated and then nausea took over. I am pretty sure it was due to Chipotle as everything else I ate yesterday was the standard home prep food I eat everyday. 

I feel sick even thinking about this place now. I think they still need to fix something or shutdown for good. I am never going back to a Chipotle again.
