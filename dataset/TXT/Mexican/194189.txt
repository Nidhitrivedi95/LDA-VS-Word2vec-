osDf5vkpammUvYca4P5z2g Honestly, the bar is low for Taco Bell; I realize what I'm getting into every time I order that crunch wrap supreme. However, this particular Taco Bell is next level awful. They mess up our order EVERY. Single. Time. (And not forgetting you said no tomatoes but forgetting chicken in your chicken cantina bowl or black beans in your cantina bowl ... or ya know, both plus a taco for kicks). Yet, I've continued go back bc chalupa are delicious and this is in my neighborhood. Well, NEVER AGAIN; they gave us food poisoning and while I shouldn't be surprised, I hope this can serve as a warning for someone else. This Taco Bell is officially the worst.
