h4Q-uSoOIhMoIsOhat6l3A Great location clean facility. Sadly the food here isn't as good as the original one. Tried this place 2 times and I'm done. Rice was oily and under cooked. We ordered stuff that we had to ask multiple times for. The chicken enchiladas there are bland and the red sauce taste salty and likes can off spaghetti O's! The fresh flour tortillas were burnt and  brittle. Ordered my picky kid a basic burger and fries to have the fries be frozen in the middle! Come on really? Two stars for the friendly staff and quick seating but food wise go elsewhere people
