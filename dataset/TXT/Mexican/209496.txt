qHseX2NHeUUedIgs_VasZA We used La Palapa to cater a networking event. Jesús was very great with responding to us in a timely manner. Additionally, they provided great care in setting up for our event. Most importantly, the food was delicious!! We ordered the tacos and quesadillas for 100 people. It did not disappoint. All our guests raved about it, some even asking where we catered from. 
I would really love to come into the restaurant and enjoy the food again!
