tCkd8eAx2mR0oioQcqkxPw This is a good taco place if you're craving some street tacos. Casual, good service and vibe. Got the carne asada and baja taco. They are smaller portions than other places but they are just $3 each so $6 total for lunch or dinner is a great deal for me! The carne was good but the baja was a bit too greasy. The horchata was warm even when ice was added and bland tasting so I probably will pass on that next time. Some ratings stated that there is a good assortment of salsa.  When I went, they had just 3 choices: Hot, med and mild (guacamole?).  When I think of a good assortment, I'm comparing it to La Santisima which has 10+ choices at their salsa bar!
