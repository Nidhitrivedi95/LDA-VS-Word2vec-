bgOgbr7ocyfYafqUAaR0WA Decent burritos but this place needs a hygiene check. Neither of the staff behind the counter were wearing gloves and were moving between touching the food and handling the cash. Funny thing is there was a box of rubber gloves on the counter top. Would really like to see this place succeed in our neighborhood but check yourself before you wreck yourself!!
