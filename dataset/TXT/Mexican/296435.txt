zCmwErM82hdKl4L2UixDJw I absolutely love this place!  I now live in Boston but grew up in Lakewood, and every time I come back to visit family and friends I always make a date at least once to eat at Barrio (if I'm lucky, sometimes twice).  

Their margaritas are the best I've ever had (and that's after living in the southwest for several years!).  I love making my own tacos and trying new combinations every time I go, and nothing beats free chips and salsa!  

Barrio is a Lakewood must, so if you haven't been there yet, you're missing out.
