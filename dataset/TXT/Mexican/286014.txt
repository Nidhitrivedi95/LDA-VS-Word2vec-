YaTlfyPieOXwHH16wzieFg We had lunch at Cafe Rio this afternoon.  Its fast casual mexican food w/ a cafeteria-like set up, kinda like a mexican subway.  My fav is the shredded chicken burrito w/ rice & black beans, enchilada style (verde sauce & melted cheese over the burrito).  I like the meat quality, seasoning & drink selection better at Cafe Rio over Chipotle.  The spice level at Chipotle is a little much for my 3yr old plus the free nino quesadilla is an added bonus.  Our total including drinks today was ~$25.
