fK1oj0dk9Bc6KsBk5mMDxg We ordered two braised beef enchiladas and one chicken enchilada for delivery through Foodora. When the meals came, we were missing one and the other two were incomplete. I have been to the restaurant before and ordered the same thing - there was so much food I couldn't finish it. The food we received on delivery was small enough to eat for a snack. We called to ask about the order and waited on hold for about 5 minutes. They did offer to send another meal, but we were not interested in receiving another cold, small meal. We got our money back.
