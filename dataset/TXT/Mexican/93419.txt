e4NQLZynhSmvwl38hC4m-A Pretty good tacos here! I'd definitely come back. The ambiance is nice and the space isn't huge so it's a nice place to go with a small group. Oh and the price is super super reasonable!

Coming from San Diego, I'm pretty particular about my Mexican food. After trying all the tacos, I'd say I liked the Carne asada then chicken, and birria in that order. The star of the show for me was the Carne asada tostada!!!! I'm excited to come back and try the rest of the menu, but the tostada may be in my order to stay!
