gldPX9ANF5Nic0N7igu2og Solid spot!

Quick thoughts:

-Fair priced food/drinks. Happy hour prices are great. Will be back during HH. 

-Decor is cool. Lots of skullz. RIP tonic (will miss u).

-The music was oddly loud for lunch at noon on a Thursday. I felt like I was in da club.

-Tacos are generously sized compared to the two-bite Bakersfield tacos down the street; I built two brisket tacos which were pretty num.

-Queso + chips were good. A Generous amount of dip and waiter gave us extra chips.

-Margaritas are good. They use real fruit/lime juice.

-The menus are a bit confusing at first!

-All in all: 4 stars for above average food/drinks at super reasonable prices but docked a star bc nothing really stood out as OMGZ
