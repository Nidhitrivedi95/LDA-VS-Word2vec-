lXE09qNzIeqgVLJGsylEXg I am a returning customer.  It is SO GOOD. You must have cilantro on it....  It just brings out the flavors.  You can always expect really beautiful,  fresh,  delicious ingredients here.  Beautiful  food.  Beautiful  people.  I love this place.  Horchata is wonderful to cool your pallette if you are like me. ( I always add a lot of jalapeños.)    if you haven't been there  you are missing out on a really handy place to eat in or even to grab food to bring home.  We really like it.
