LBBp51YHui5gvXNSyUcLKg Very average Mexican food, but cool atmosphere. Tacos come in hard shells, the Verde salsa is average. The do have a great happy hour, lots of TVs in the bar area. If you are trying to stay on a budget, this happy hour is a great deal! If you want good food, perhaps not the best pick. Ambiance is a typical Mexican-American restaurant. Flip Flops, shorts and t shirt. They do have a cool patio area on a urban lake.
