ydt5yifyYhF5s430llv_Hw Daughter & I were seated in the patio area which was nice. Waitress wasn't personable at all to us but was exceptionally friendly with the table of guys seated behind us who ordered beer. The food was decent but nothing outstanding...thought I try something new so I had the Mahi Mahi bites. My daughter liked her meal but cannot recall what she ordered. A beverage refill would have been nice. We'll definitely try another restaurant next time.
