OACjhgf8nnYGzFnOhA7uhg Was there when it first opened and have to say, the place has gone downhill for sure.  Maybe because it was raining out, but the place inside was filled. And loud.  Very loud. But no one was eating.  That should have been a sign.  We ordered the steak fajitas, a large guacamole/chips and a salad.  Portions are now pathetically small.  Drinks are cheap (I guess that's why no one else was eating - $5 house wine on a Friday night and $5/6 other drinks).  My suggestion:  eat somewhere else then come by here if you want a drink. You can't really talk, though, so don't count on being able to carry on a conversation.
