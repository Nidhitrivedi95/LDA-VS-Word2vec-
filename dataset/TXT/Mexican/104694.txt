fGnILhhgE393e-8X9JIB4Q This place was a poor excuse for authentic Mexican food. The burrito was soggy and the fajita was sub par at most. My burrito was served with steamed broccoli....at a Mexican restaurant??!! 
I would never return to this restaurant again. We were genuinely confused with the reviews after eating our meal and leaving most of it on our plate.
