Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ OUTSTANDING !!!  I absolutely love this place.   The food is unbelievable.  So authentic and yummy.  The salsa served upon arrival is the best I have ever had.  I had the lobster enchiladas and they were to die for...I also had the cheese panela....words cannot describe how good this was the chorizo oil just put it over the top.  My friends plate which was a trio of yumminess was pretty delicious as well.   We also tried some margaritas, quite a few actually and they were all GREAT.  We cannot wait to go back to Javier's on our next visit.  Vegas offers so many great dining experiences, but Javier's does stick out to me as one they must be frequented on every visit it is that GOOD!
