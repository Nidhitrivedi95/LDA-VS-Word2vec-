FoKx_RP4kUM-aiGo3wlUUw We have been looking for some good Mexican food since we got here to pheniox. The wait staff was extremely friendly and very helpful with the menu. I really enjoyed the drinks and the meal was fresh and filled the whole plate. My gals was just as good. If you need a spot to get the real deal then this is it
