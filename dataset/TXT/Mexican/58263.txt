aDWOXQVSvRPOpqcJ1ja0_Q The review is primarily based on taste alone. It located close to where I work.  The place may look like a junk outside looking, but it tastes pretty good and that's really all I care about in a wrap/sub place.  It's made to order so it tastes fresh and delicious.  You can also choose the spice level you want and I always opt for extra spicy which I don't find it spicy at all.  The portion is also very big and priced reasonably.  The deco may look old but it tastes much better than many of the so called chained burrito place out there.  It's fusion style and I think they use potato to replace rice/bead used in traditional Mexican burrito.  I'd recommend any of the jumbo burrito.
