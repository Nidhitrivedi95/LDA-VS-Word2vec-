cYhv7XVpqJIpb6BLzZBaFQ Last week while on a business trip I stopped here for dinner after looking at Yelp reviews. I ordered the shrimp fajitas. During ordering I asked if I could substitute out the refried beans for charra bean and was told they only served refried beans so that's what I ordered. I usually don't like refried beans because they usually don't taste good and they are bad for,you.

About 10 minutes later my food arrived and I took a pic of it. Looked really good with a lot of shrimp and veggies. I ate the meal and was very satisfied. I decided to try the refried beans and wound eating all of them. They were some of the best I have ever had. Excellent beans. My service was good and I liked the decor of the restaurant. My only annoyance was a very loud table of 6 that were near me that had drank too much wine and beer. Oh well...

I believe this is a very good restaurant!
