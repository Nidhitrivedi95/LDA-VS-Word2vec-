hisaMvsxMzo08xigPIwXiA The beauty of having random date days with my husband is the fact that lunch dates are a lot quieter than dinner ones.  In fact at 11:45 am we weren't entirely sure if the restaurant was open.  The sign declared "yes" so we went in.

There is ample parking here and you must ignore the drive-in window from when the building was previously a fast food place.  I loved what looks like hand painting over the brown tile for decor and there are also other tropical and beach decor to complete their theme.  It's not awesome, but that's ok.

What stands out in this restaurant is the food.  It was phenomenal.  The menu is full of seafood meals galore and upon seating you are greeted with hot crispy tortilla shells and salsas.  There was a fresh ground shrimp salsa that I could have eaten with a spoon.  

I ordered a garlic shrimp dish.  The shrimp were large, meaty and much to my husband's dismay, very garlicky.  I still taste garlic and there shouldn't be any vampires near me for a few days at least.  The shrimp is served with fries, fresh salad veggies that were lovely and crisp, a piece of garlic bread that managed the perfection of a hot crispy outside and fluffy inside.  The rice was not mediocre, it also had bits of veggies in it, though it wasn't a heavy fried rice.  I couldn't finish my meal even though I wanted to.

The service was spotty, great at some moments and then overlooked at others and I wasn't fond of the tv blaring a soap opera in Spanish, but the food was still worth a 4 star review.
