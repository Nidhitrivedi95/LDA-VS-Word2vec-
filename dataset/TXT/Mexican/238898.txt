T-KniGykrZ46ZC9plOTspw The food here was very average. I was under the impression that chips and salsa were free from prior reviews but they are $4. I got a carne Asada burrito and the meat was very dry and I also ordered beans in my burrito and there were none inside. According to the people I was with the chicken was also not very good. The service was not very good with the exception of one of their youngest employees (a young guy). I would not recommend.
