Qor28v4BlhSwtN8DSvah9g LOVE THIS PLACE!!

Visiting NV for some Vegas thing and never discover this place even thou this was not our first time until we met up with some local NV residents.  Now I'm a fan and from now on this place will be the first place to pig out the minute we set foot in NV.  Their food are fresh and full of flavors with each bite.  We had carnitas, carne asada, lengua, cabeza taco and their deep fried tilapia.  Their portion size for taco are so much more compare to taco place in Dallas.  They were all delicious and now making my mouth water just thinking about it.  My only wish is for someone to open Pepe's Taco in Dallas.
