ROuiI7sWhEMLodSylU2Qpg Good tacos  but the salsa needs work. I really like thier tripas. The desert are pre-made pre-packaged outside of the restaurant. The marinade to use for their meat bottled but it's good it's good yeah it's good. If you like American Mexican food this place is good yeah it's it's good.
