DyOzNIeXUksPNLXYHnB-oQ I've had Sabor Latin Street Grill bookmarked (as a place I wanted to try) for a while and finally got to try it last night before going to Ovens Theatre for Wicked! Sabor is not really a dinner-before-a-show kinda place, but at the same time, why shouldn't it be? You order up at the counter, pick a beer from the cooler and get your sauces from the salsa bar area. The place was buzzing with people on a Wednesday night. 

We ordered the chips, a build-your-own-bowl as well as a quinoa rice + avocado bowl (add Tilapia)... Everything was fresh and good. Chips were outstanding! :) Sabor is a unique little place that has somehow created a slightly different non-chainy twist on Latin food. Yum. This place is right around the corner from me so I imagine that it will become a regular pit stop. 

Oh - check-in on Yelp BEFORE you eat there. I did so as I was leaving and saw the "free chips" offer. Oh well, next time!
