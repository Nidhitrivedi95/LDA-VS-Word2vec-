iOt7ebp4Zy-5YUjHL1rbmQ We stumbled upon this place and it did not disappoint! The quesedillas are AWESOME, authentic and not too much cheese. Crazy potato was delicious too but not a lot of food for the price. We did the drive through on a Saturday night and it was relatively quick considering it's not fast food. Great price overall and yummy drinks too. The patio looks adorable and large. Salsa was good. Skip the Gordita.
