CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q Amazing carne asada fries! These are definitely the best carne asada fries I have ever had. There is a large selection of different tacos to pick from here and the service is super fast. My boyfriend and I found this little treasure when we were visiting Vegas with his family and everyone enjoyed it. 

I remember that it was scorching hot that day so I got a popsicle from the little mini freezer and it was so perfect! Definitely come visit this place on your next Vegas trip!
