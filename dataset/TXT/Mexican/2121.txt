-e_UQJVTzIPweX4TcPUYVw Found this place based on their Yelp reviews. Came here for a date with the hubs and really enjoyed the ambiance, service and food. The classic margarita was strong and served in an actual margarita glass, not some hipster mason jar BS. Delicious tacos and vegan options! Will be back again!
