-Qkx7W0itbAApcG5lJuMFQ Got here at 6pm on Saturday right before the crowd came.  My friend told me later that when he went it was nearly 50min from the time he got in line to the time he got his food.  After much thought I settled on the Rockport since it was a guest favorite.

This is only the 2nd time that I've had a sushi burrito and while its enjoyable to watch them make it or have them serve it to you, thats where the more enjoyment for me laid.  The seaweed was a bit soggier than I would have liked but not bad.  My friend and I thought that the rice could have been slightly longer tho.  There is not much soft shell crab and most of what I got were legs.  The eel sauce to chipotle mayo ratio was good.
