yVBgxJoLTQyspbCNhvUuwA I ordered a chorizo and egg burrito, it was a huge, sloppy, off-putting, pile of mess. The Chorizo was "chewy" for some strange reason, and it didn't have that familiar somewhat spicy chorizo kick to it. The burrito tasted bland and thrown together. Worse than the awful burrito was the horrible customer service of the employee...he basically threw my food out the window at me, and he replied to me with an aggravated sounding "What?" twice when  I asked him questions... I threw the disgusting burrito in the trash where it belonged, and I'll never, ever go back there again!
