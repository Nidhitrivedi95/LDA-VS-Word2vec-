Qor28v4BlhSwtN8DSvah9g This location has the worse customer service ever.   We order 55 dollars worth of food and when  it was come to leave I asked to have a take out box and a stupid want to be cook told Me he could not give me one.  How the heck are you suppose to take 3 tacos home, if you Oder the food for eating in.  He put an argument with me and did not give me a container.   I can tell you this idiot just lost a good customer and screw their tip, because the 10 dollars I was going to leave them am handing it to the homeless outside.

Food is stupid expensive and not all that with the type of service they definably won't see me again ...
