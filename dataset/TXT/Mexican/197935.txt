p-w6g8cuQq5PU_4U1XNCzQ This is a cute little spot.  I love the chips and their margaritas are great!!!!!!! The food was good, but I only got 4 shrimp when I ordered camarones al mojo de ajo, which was a HUGE bummer.  I was actually  taken aback.  The Flan was ok, nothing memorable.  I will probably go back because the employees are very nice and welcoming. I won't go to eat, however.
