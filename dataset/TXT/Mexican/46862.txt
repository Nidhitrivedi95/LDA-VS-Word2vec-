7tdVsSDXRKtLLC-fD1hJ-A First off until last week we had not experienced better. Normally we don't have any issues. We don't mind a brief wait to be seated. The chip guy keeps us stocked up and the drinks are full. The place is generally clean as are the restrooms. People are talking and having fun. The problem we had last week at lunch time was our order Quatro (My wife and I share due to her weight loss surgery) when brought to the table the plate was hot to touch but the burrito, enchilada and the taco were cold. My wife called over the waitress. She offered to have it redone. When the waitress brought the replacement order the plate was extremely hot as was the food to the point the sauce on the enchilada was burnt around the edges. There was no way of eating any of it until it cooled down about a couple hundred degrees. I did not say anything but felt that my dissatisfaction with my order might have been met with some kind of resentment and the fire hot plate not the normal hot to touch plate was a form of retaliation. We like Nandos and have dined at the north Mesa location as well. I just hope our recent experience is not the future of the place.
