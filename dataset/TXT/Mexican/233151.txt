sS__otwzn0INyR_5Dimfdg 1020 pm drive thru hits the spot. I ordered 3 carne asada tacos and my friend ordered a carne asada burrito. The meals came with a box of cabbage, cucumber, lime, and pico. There was also a separate side of grilled onions. Everything was fantastic. But they don't serve guacamole....weird. No bueno. Everything else was amazing. Can't tell from the outside, but definitely at least drive thru
