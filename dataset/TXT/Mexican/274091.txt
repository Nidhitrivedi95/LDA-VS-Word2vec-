X57f6FWZiwI1wOidPPhOrQ My friend and I ordered take out last night; the guy on the phone rushed my order & was talking to someone in the background where he had to ask me to repeat myself at least 6 times. He told me it would be done in about 10 minutes. We show up at the restaurant 20 minutes later to pick it up, and its still not done. We wait ANOTHER 25 minutes for them to finish our food. Whats the point of take out then? Service = Horrible. & the food was just as bad. I ordered the Acupulco, that was "okay". We ordered three steak tacos with corn torillas and all toppings on there; it came with flour tortillas and non of the toppings we asked for. The steak was dry and tasted nasty. The rice, tasted nasty. The salsa, tasted like the salsa taco bell gives you with their taco salads. Just no.....& the food came out to $27.50??? Not to mention the creepy vibe I got from there by the staff. Yeah, never going there again. Just head over to Maize instead.
