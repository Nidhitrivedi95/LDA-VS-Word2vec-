dODimuyIJGIxER5uzX5WuQ 4 star rating is relative to the price.  Cannot beat it. Best food for the money in north Scottsdale.  Highlights include supreme nachos (huge portion -loaded); chile rellenos; machaca; taco salad.  The salsas are good, but I wouldn't call them the best (that distinction goes to Rubios).

Consistently very quick service in store and at  drive thru.

Late night munchies???  Can't do much better than this place.
