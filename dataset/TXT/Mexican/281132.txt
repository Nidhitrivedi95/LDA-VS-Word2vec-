XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg If you like Tex-Mex/southwestern food, come here. It didn't blow me away, but that's because the style of food isn't my favorite.

They have a great selection of wine, which is a plus. You'll be hard pressed to find a bottle under $50 though, so beware.

For appetizers, we tried the tuna nachos, which were REALLY GOOD, and the goat cheese "queso fundido," which was EH. The queso didn't even taste like goat cheese and it was really oily and reminiscent of what happens when I microwave cheese at home with nachos.

For my entree, I went with their only vegetarian option--the chile relleno. It was good, but, at the end of the day, it was cornmeal-encrusted chile stuffed with cheese for $25. I guess what I'm saying is this place is really pricey for what you get.

The ambiance is nice, but the windows look right out into the sports book betting area, so it's not easy to forget you're in Vegas with a bunch of weirdos.
