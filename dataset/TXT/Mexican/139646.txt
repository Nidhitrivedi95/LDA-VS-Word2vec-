j4170xdQJTwSvXFpsQzWtg BEST puerto rican food in Ohio.

I went to PR over the summer and this is the only place that comes CLOSE to real native puerto rican food- you MUST try!

Plantains are my absolute FAV and they were bomb (a must get). The rice & beans were very very good along with the Shrimp Mofongo. The empandada's were so so, i probably wouldn't get them again. My friend got the #1 (i cant rem what it's called) but he loved loved loved it. The portions are HUGE so don't fill up on the yummy app's like I did.

I will def be coming back that's for sure.
