Wc9UpJhOcdSj7olZkz7SJA WOW that burger was good!! I wasn't planning on eating a whole double burger.... but I just couldn't stop :P Fresh hand-cut fries and homemade lemonade. Nothing at all to complain about, delicious :) And the staff was very friendly walking me through the menu for my first time there! Be back soon!
