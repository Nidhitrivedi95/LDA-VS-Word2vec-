pomGBqfbxcqPv14c3XH-ZQ I was here once a long time ago and then again about 6 weeks ago.

Apparently in the interim the management changed?

It was pretty solid the first time, but on the second visit I was waiting for a friend to show up (he did not, dork) so I had two baskets of chips with their amazing salsas, a couple of margaritas, and eventually a small dish that is escaping my memory at the moment (maybe more than a couple margaritas). It was delicious and amazing to the tune of "why have I not wandered into this place?" It's literally up the street, about a 15 minute walk, which comes in handy post-margarita...

Tara and Rudolfo behind the bar Monday and Tuesday, they were very cool, and the whole place appears to be stocked with nice employees from what I could tell.

Good stuff!
