mHb5PqEb2qETQEPQXVVR-Q I come to this location at least once a week. 

I really love their salads, and they are a great size and when I have a $5 coupon they are are great value. The cilantro dressing always taste fresh and delicious. 

The only reason I give this place 4 stars and not 5 would be the chicken... crazy this place is called el pollo loco but the chicken most of the time is super dry and just meh. When it's diced or put in dishes you can't tell as much because the sauces and other components are helping the taste and texture but when I get the family deal with drums and thighs... ouch not good. 

But I do love them salads... mmmm, just had one... I'm gonna nap now. Zzzzzz
