IcSr0gUNSgVvjsgqSEKnbw Alma WxSW (apologies to Alfred Hitchcock who may have preferred NxNW) is one of about two hundred restaurants that sits in the Shops at Gainey Village (OK, a slight exaggeration)!  It is in a standalone building in the northeast corner (OK-I guess the southwest corner was unavailable).  While we have been multiple times for dinner, they also serve breakfast and lunch and the owners also operate Soul Cafe in North Scottsdale.

All that said, the food is fantastic.  The blackened mahi mahi was not overly spiced, but delicious on a bed of dirty rice, black beans, corn and red peppers.  The chicken mole was delicious, as well.  While the mole is of the dark variety with some chocolate flavor, it is lightly applied over the chicken which maintains its juiciness.  The Mexaloaf was tasty but just a bit on the dry side.  It was the only entree item I have had there that was less than stellar (still good though).  Once of the best dishes (on special) was Beef Stroganoff.  The meat used was top notch, not something sitting in the back of a freezer two days from its expiration.  The cuisine is Southwestern, and exceptional.  Service has been A+ on each of our visits, as well.

They also have an extensive wine and cocktail list to go with all the great food.  There is a large patio with heaters as well as two large indoor seating areas and a nice bar area.  They had live music there on two of our visits, although I am not sure if that is still the case.  There are a variety of desserts, but it is usually tough to find any room after getting through appetizers and dinner.  This place deserves a large following, and all the Fridays we have been there, the restaurant has been quite busy.  I am looking to come back on a Wednesday, when they offer their all you can eat fried chicken.  We certainly plan to be regular visitors.  Pricing is reasonable, which makes this spot all the more appealing.
