VH2BjFjc9usDquDgoHhptA I was there on a business trip. And this was the only place that seemed to be open past midnight on a Thursday night. 
The jack and cokes were like 2.50. Amazing price. The tacos were really good as well. I am not sure what taco I ate because I had to many Jack and cokes but I do know they were great. I also really liked their salsa. 

Way to go.
