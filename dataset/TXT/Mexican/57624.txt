a8pmtlVKf7NiSLI-4KejIw Though I ate here back in August, I still remember the food and the experience (which was good). My group arrived after work excited, pumped, and ready to eat and drink.  When I made my reservation I said that it "would be nice" to be seated outside, and to my surprise, considering the long line of people waiting to be seated outside, the resturant had reserved an outdoor table for us. I split guacamole and chips, churros and three dipping sauces with a coworker and I ate my own plate of chicken tacos. Though everything was amazing (including my glass of rose), the portions were rather small but I guess that's how the place rolls. The ambiance was good though,  and everyone was thanking me for picking the place. I would absolutely eat here again. 4.5 stars.
