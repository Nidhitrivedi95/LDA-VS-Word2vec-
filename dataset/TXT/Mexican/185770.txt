nVGPxMooxSiaSH_wHvcRbw After a challenging day of taking a sick baby to the doctor, barely getting my 3-year-old to preschool on time, reiki class, getting him picked up, and now jetting him to occupational therapy, I had not eaten all day. With no time to get out of the car, and just enough to speed through a drive-thru, I was desperate so I went through at this Taco Bell. I only eat meat twice per week and I do not eat red meat at all really. I ordered a grilled stuffed chicken burrito with no cheese and no refried beans (trying to keep it as healthy as possible). You can imagine my disappointment when I bit into it and found steak instead of chicken inside. :"( They had even confirmed with me that my order was correct on the screen. I can't be late to my son's therapy. I have no time to go back. I am still hungry. Bummer. Shame on you Taco Bell. :-( :-( :-(
