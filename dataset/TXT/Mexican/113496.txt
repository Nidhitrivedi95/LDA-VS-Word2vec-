gDOuHjntsN37XEjROoQ2Aw Sitting on the couch I had a craving for fish tacos but being in Arizona this can prove harder to satisfy than normal. The tacos and fries here are legit. I made the mistake of ordering these to go and the crispyness of the fish steamed away a bit but the flavors were still there. 

The salsa bar was a wonderland of flavors and colors. Try the green sauce in the bottles. You will not be disappointed. My only real issue was the cabbage is chopped up fine instead of shredded which is a staple of traditional fish tacos. That being said the fish makes up for it. Staff was super helpful and service was really quick. Get in there for some tasty tacos!
