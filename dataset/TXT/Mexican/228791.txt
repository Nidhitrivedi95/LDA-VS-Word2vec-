sAu9UJ5tvY6sc9Q_gcVV7Q After driving home from. Las Vegas we wanted to grab some Mexican food and sit down and have a Margarita. We checked out a few places on Yelp near our home that we had not tried yet,  and we're still open. This popped up and they were open until 10pm so we stopped in. 

It was a Monday night 90 mins before closing so we weren't sure what to expect but there were a few others eating later as well. The restaurant is sit down and full service with many booths and authentic recorded music playing at a very nice level for conversing. 

This is the cuisine of Mexico City and not your typical americanized version. The chips come with three salas and all were great. Chips thin and crispy just like I like them. We ordered a small pitcher of the house Margarita and we each got 2+ glasses out of it. Not too sweet or tangy...  just right. 

I had the Carne Asada with cheese enchilada, rice and refried beans. Steak cooked medium was tender and juicy and not too much salt. The rice and beans nice and the cheese enchilada was not greasy and tasted very fresh and nice. 

My wife had the Enchiladas Suizas and chose to have one of each (beef, chicken and cheese) and all were very tasty and fresh as well. This plate came with Ranchero beans and she loved those too. 

Our server was very attentive but not overly so. She let us sit and enjoy. 

We will definitely be back and try more items on the menu. This was a great first visit.
