5tl4tyaJEzGeAdbi_L7PzQ Amazing home made taste! This is the best authentic tasting Mexican food I've had in a while. From the outside I was hesitant to go in but I couldn't resist the smell of the meat cooking on the grill out front! Pricing is great and people here are friendly. Don't let the look of the place fool you, this place is a diamond in the rough!
