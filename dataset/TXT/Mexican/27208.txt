3FiTfmHWr1TbDbaepDrC2A The food here gets five stars. The staff get five stars. The cleanliness of the dining area is always one star. The tables are always, and I mean always dirty. Not enough attention is given to the cleanliness or the dining area. It makes me wonder what goes on in the prep area. Too bad too,  because the food here is so good. Owner, please respond.
