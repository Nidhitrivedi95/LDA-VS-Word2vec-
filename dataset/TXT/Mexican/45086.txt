7mU3l5VjH1IxsXcxBxUblg My friends and I tried Emiliano's restaurant last night and we really enjoyed the atmosphere and food. Portions were perfect, the food fresh, tasty, and hot! The only positive criticism, the  service, although polite and courteous, very slow. 
   I would still recommend people to go, just give yourself extra time for the wait. The food is worth it!
