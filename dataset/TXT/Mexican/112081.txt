G6BwYw_0_atLPTzI1uokIA My husband has been wanting to try Nacho Daddy for a very long time but I had been against it. To me, the name just did not sound appealing and I just was not interested in trying this place. However, we were visiting friends and he finally got his way. We were a party of 6 and got seated really quickly on a Saturday night. Our server was ok, she got the job done and was reasonably friendly. I was super convinced that I would hate the food but I actually liked it. I just went the safe route and ordered the chicken quesadilla  and it was really good and filling with lots of chicken and cheese in it. My friends and husband ordered various nacho plates and were all pleased with their meals we also had the enchilada plate and the tortilla soup. Everything was actually really good, definitely not authentic Mexican food but good food and a great place to hang out with friends. I never thought that I would say this- but yes, I would come back to Nacho Daddy.
