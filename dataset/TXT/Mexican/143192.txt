JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg We visited Vegas in December so this review is a little late, and I may have to edit it as I recall more of my visit and my waitresses name, whom I wrote down, but lost what I wrote it on. It was a late lunch, and my wife and kids had already eaten, but I was determined to experience this place and their mole, so what do you do? Leave the wife and kids in the car! As long as you don't go next door. Horrible, I know, but they were tired and sleeping and I figured it would make a good Vegas story. To be clear, I went to the restaurant, not the place next door. I had a margarita, and the mole. Service was great, the manager came by and checked on me, as well as Chef Paco, who personally brought out my dessert flan. The mole was fantastic, 3 kinds, but portion was huge so had to take some home. And the family was safe and sound and still asleep when I got back.
