G4hjhtA_wQ-tSOGpgGlDjw I just INHALED three grilled shrimp tacos from Bajamar. It's right down the street from my house, and it's going to be a problem. 

Decently priced, quick and very friendly service, and the best fish tacos in Vegas. I'm so hooked. See what I did there? 

This is my third visit, and each time I've left super happy and satisfied. I've had both grilled and fried shrimp tacos, and some of their fish tacos which were all equally amazing. Their horchata is a bit too sweet for my liking, but don't let that stop you from ordering it. The sauce they put on the tacos isn't too heavy and overpowering and lets the rest of the flavors come through. I'm so excited to have this gem in Downtown Las Vegas!
