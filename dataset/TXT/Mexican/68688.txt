I was so excited for this place to open because I love tacos! I've been here three times now since they opened and the food is just OK. The tacos are super small, don't have much stuffed in them and are just missing something! Maybe more sauces/ spices would help?! I know this is more fancy, but there's no comparison to my love of barrios super stuffed flavorful tacos! The salsas on the "salsa fight" are very delicious but you don't get enough chips to finish them and they charge $2 for more chips. The guac is very fresh and was a decent portion. The drinks a little pricey, but they are strong

I noticed they changed their ordering slips and added more items the last time I was there. I really want to love this place, but so far the food is just missing something. Service is lacking too, as it takes a long time for anything and everything.  I hope they keep improving their menu and hope the service will get better too as the summer goes on. The patio alone will keep me coming back again!
