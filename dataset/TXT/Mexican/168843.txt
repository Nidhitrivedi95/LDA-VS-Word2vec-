lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw This review is in regards to the AYCE tacos/tequila/margaritas. Vegas itself doesn't compare to Taco Tuesday's in California, but glad to see this place is starting the trend here! I came here for my first time on Taco Tuesday & boy was my assumption right. This place is dangerous! This included chicken, beef, and/or pork options. Since it's ayce, the soft tacos were basic. Nothing crazy We had to request for sour cream, limes, & tomatillo sauce on the side so our tacos weren't so flavorless or dry. Don't forget to request those in order to enhance your meal. The margaritas were chilled & neither on the rocks or frozen. They were strong though. The tequila shots at least came with lime, but no salt. It didn't taste like Jose Cuervo or anything cheap. The tequila earns 4 stars itself in my opinion. I'd say Libres' atmosphere & AYCE special is definitely worth the value. I'd come back for it because I'm a fan of both. I have friends who don't care for tequila so I don't think the $27 tacos would be worth it to them. The tacos start getting more satisfying after a few rounds (haha). One reason why I couldn't give 5 stars is for the super super slow service that night. I felt as if for every one request we had, we had to ask for it twice in order for our female server to remember. She would check on us, but man I don't think she listened well. Make sure you have a DD if you plan on coming here.
