57aBx6Mo_VRk_kMA8J5Efg This place falls into a wonderful category: The hole-in-the-wall excellence. On the edge of a shopping mall in Indian Trail, this place looks unobtrusive but friendly. The menu puts the next smile on your face with its cheap prices. When it came out, a lot of the food looked a lot like that at other decent Mexican places like this, but when I tasted it, it was so much better! Beware of hot sauces/dishes though, they really mean it there. The staff is very friendly.

This is a place for a simple, middle-of-the-week meal out that will make your wallet and your tastebuds happy.
