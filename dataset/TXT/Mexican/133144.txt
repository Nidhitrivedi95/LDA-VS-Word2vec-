iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg Very overrated.  I had the blackened mahi mahi taco which was very fishy tasting and not tasty at all really . The carnitas pork taco was bland and lacked flavor. The gobernator taco was okay but nothing to right home about. The daily fresh juices are nice tho. All in all, highly overrated,  overhyped, underwhelming taco place. Definitely not deserving of the high acclaim it is receiving.  La carnitas tacos are leaps and bounds better in my opinion. Not one of the tacos I had the stood out as particularly good and the blackened mahi mahi stood out as particularly bad. The juice is the highlight. Would I go back? No, not when I have had way better elsewhere. In short; okay, overrated, very hipster-y, not as good as nearby taco places.
