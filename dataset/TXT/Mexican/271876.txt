wrVKiNlNI3xE302fDbrVBw Unless for some reason you can't  go to chipotles, burrito boyz or burrito bandidos, and you really need to satisfy your burrito fix, then I guess you can come here.. I got a steak and spicy chicken burrito.. No real flavour in the meat.. The fillings were kind of watery.. When they toasted the burrito, it was still kind of soggy.. I don't see why people would go here so often.. And if you're used to getting a large burrito, this place's small is about the same size as a burrito boyz small
