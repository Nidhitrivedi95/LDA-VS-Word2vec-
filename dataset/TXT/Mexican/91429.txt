DyOzNIeXUksPNLXYHnB-oQ Right next to Hawthorne Pizza, this place deserves a review, seeing as I have visited this place three times in one week. 

I ordered the grilled chicken Aunthenticos. It has great flavor, and most importantly, they are always more than generous with the protein. The tacos are double wrapped in a warm corn tortilla and the salsa bar gives life the zest that it so desperately needs sometimes. I recommend the pineapple habanero. 

Don't forget to get your free order of chips when you check in! The portion is big enough for two people to share. Did I mention the free salsa bar? 

Lastly, the prices are fantastic. Coupled with the prompt and polite service, it's no wonder I had no problem eating here three times in one week.
