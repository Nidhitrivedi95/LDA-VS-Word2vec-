HWl2EbZhkhAkFgqt44yUkA My friends and I came here for Happy Hour. We sat at one of the bars. We sat at our table for a little while thinking a waitress would come, but she didn't. No big deal, so we went to the bar. My friend waited literally 10 minutes at the bar (we know this because our other friend was on the phone while it happened and she saw the call timer) waiting for one of the 2 or 3 bartenders to hand us a menu. Before handing us menus, she demanded to see our ID's. We brought them back right away (we had a table like 3 feet from the bar), and then we had to wait even longer for her to check them. After looking through the menu (and getting such horrible service before we even ordered anything), we decided to go back to our room and drink in there instead.
