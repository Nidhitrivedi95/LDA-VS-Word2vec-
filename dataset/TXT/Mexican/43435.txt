7GGJlp1aWfcXGQz6q7SkXQ I've stopped at the Rock House to grab a quick drink (in the front by the casino hallway) and had nothing but good service.  Friendly waitresses and bartenders.

HOWEVER, once we ventured inside to eat, it was a disaster.  The service was terrible throughout the meal.  Our waitress just disappeared.  After finishing our food and waiting 20 minutes I went to hunt her down so we could pay and get back to normal Vegas activities.  Waited another 20 minutes and still no check!  We literally had to hunt her down again and threaten to walk out on the bill before we got our check.

Never again.  You've been warned.
