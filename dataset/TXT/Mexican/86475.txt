dF47LvoipaCACkZ4LAnBMQ Just don't. I'm not even done eating my food and I have to review this badly because I can't even. The table is dirty, the free chips that came came in a previously used basket (we realized this after when at the bottom we saw leftover sauce from the person before), the lady who served us carried one of the water glasses in her armpit, the guacamole was subpar, and the enchilada and tacos were worse than chipotle (and to me chipotle is considered edible and would go back.) I have no idea why it's given a 3 stars.
