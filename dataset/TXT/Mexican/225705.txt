I grew up eating Mexican food (I was the token Asian in my neighborhood), so I spent many days eating all the good stuff from my friends' abuelitas.  Menudo, pozole, chilequilas - I might as well consider myself half Mexican!

I had to yelp a Mexican food place in Vegas, and this one was the first to pop up.  It's just past the main strip in between Caesar's Palace and Circus Circus, and the place reeks of Taqueria (in a good way).  It's not dirty, and the employees are incredibly friendly and helpful.  Btw, no burritos here.  Tacos are mostly two dollars each and you can try the standard meats like carne asada and chicken or you could get down to the nitty gritty and go for the lengua (tongue), suadero (fatty pork shoulder), and cabeza (brain).  What's also beautifully prepared is their spicy pork on a spit.  The process ensures a tasty crisp meat contrasting the tenderness of the pork.

Everything (with the exception of the tortillas) is prepared fresh.  Tons of cilantro, diced onions, and salsa verde (or salsa roja) top off the tacos, and, man are they delicious.  My brothers were looking forward to the buffets of Las Vegas, but when I took them here on our first night, the kept suggesting we come back here.

Great food.
