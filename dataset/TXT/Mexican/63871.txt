B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA It's a pretty trendy fast food restaurant in Vegas now. We came here for some brunch, we tried most of the sushi burrito on the menu. 
-taro chip is a must, but I don't like how they coated it with sugar, if they can provide other flavors on top will be good, like Cajun 
-3amigos was good combination of some sashimi 
-angry tuna was a bit fishy to me, plus the seaweed 
-triple S was good combination, highly recommend 
For me it's like a poke style with Japan hand rolls concept, it's not bad to try it out.
