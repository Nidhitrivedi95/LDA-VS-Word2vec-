15LVDu1_v97JEx-g97wnfA Best Pizza I've had in Madison so far in 10 years living here. Eating here for the first time makes me realize I spend way too much time eating at Ian's, Glass Nickel, etc. and need to try out more places like Sal's and Grampa's in the future! A+ service and food (#1 and #2 specialty pizzas were to die for!) Be back soon!
