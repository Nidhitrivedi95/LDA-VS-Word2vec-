ibf4xvHWD4t1DOOZhidHBg Went to Modern Margarita with some friends on a Saturday night. I made a reservation but could have been seated without one as it was not overly crowded at 830pm. 
Fun vibe, the decor was casual, I will say they could and should rethink their chairs, hard metal and not comfortable at all. Maybe ask for a booth. Music was not too loud so it was easy to talk and visit with each other. Good service, our server was attentive and didn't hover. Great margaritas!  (one should hope so). If you like spicy try the Jalapeño margarita, just enough spice and not overwhelming. 
Fresh guacamole appetizer was tasty and was very fresh, decent salsa (I'm partial to Jalapeño Infernos salsa) but still fresh and not very spicy, although I do prefer a little kick it was still good with the fresh corn chips. I ordered 3 different tacos off the ala cart menu, carne asada, shrimp, and chicken. The carne asada and shrimp were very good, nice flavors,not spicy all topped topped fresh cabbage. The shrimp was my favorite. The chicken however was disappointing, it did not have any type of Mexican food qualities to it other than it was a " taco"  it tasted like barbecue chicken, not at all what I was expecting and it just didn't pair well with the other foods. If I could give  Modern Margarita 4.5 stars I would because really just the chicken taco was the only part I didn't care for, well the chair too but I'll just ask for a booth next time. Definitely will return!
