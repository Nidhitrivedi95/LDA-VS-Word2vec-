FMo1PJTUV5OpyiZlnTM1Rg Came to Sharky's after seeing they had some vegan options and it did not disappoint! I got the fajitas with tofu and no sour cream and it was delicious! The sangria was not bad either! The service was quick and the food was hot and freshly made! My friend got the tostada with chicken and said it was great! I will be coming back!
