7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA Great little place on the east side to get brunch! I had to wait about 20mins outside for a table, but one of the servers came out to greet us and tell us how long it would be. Service was prompt, and our food came on time. I got the smoked in house salmon Benedict. It came with a side of potatoes and tomatoes. The Benedict itself was good! Eggs cooked easy to how I like them, runny. I would have liked more salmon in the Benny, felt like I couldn't taste much of it and the potatoes were a bit too fried for me. No complaints other than that! Would go back to try what other items the menu has to offer.
