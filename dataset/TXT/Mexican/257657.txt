vILvd6b0jMFkKkrkpKMbbw Went through the drive thru on July 1st. 
First time at Del Taco..
Ordered the Mex. Chopped Chicken Salad & the Macho Nacho along with a small tea.
Miguel was our assistant through the drive thru and was very friendly.
The salad was really good for a fast food joint! It had sliced avocado and all, the traditional fixings atop the salad. It also came with a side a salsa. Presentation was surprisingly nice for a fast food place! Macho Nacho's were tasty and a good portion for the price. We had a coupon towards our meal too! So-for the Salad, Nacho's & a small drink it was $9.71!!
