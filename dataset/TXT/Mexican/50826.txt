I had the regular season pork tacos that came with cilantro and onion then the next day I came back for the special steak+sausage taco combo that came with lettuce, tomatoes, avocado and cheese, plus 2 regular chicken taco on top. Best authentic tacos thus far!!! I am still craving for more! And their less than $2 per taco!!! Also try the maracuya drink, it's so refreshing.
