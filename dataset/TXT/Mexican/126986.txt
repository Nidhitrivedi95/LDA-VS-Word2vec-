hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg Was there on a Friday night.
We got in without a reservation, which was good.
Food was great but the waitress was really pushing hard for us to get an appetizer, going as far as saying that the main would come quicker if we ordered something before (??). Didn't really understand the logic there, but was very annoyed at being bullied into ordering something I didn't want (we didn't get the appetizers in the end).
The music was a bit loud, but the place is nice.
Would I go back? Although the food was good the overall experience wasn't great, so NO, i won't go back any time soon.
