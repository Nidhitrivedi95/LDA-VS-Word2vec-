jWpTckAGWMWEffl2D7NhCA I've been to two other Los Favoritos locations and have always had a breakfast burrito, which is excellent.  Today I went with the carne asada fries and they were delicious.  It's a ton of food, I was only able to eat about half of it.  There's a ton of cheese and sour cream on top, which I loved.  The fries were crispy and I like that they put pico de gallo on the fries as well.  I think I found a new favorite here.
