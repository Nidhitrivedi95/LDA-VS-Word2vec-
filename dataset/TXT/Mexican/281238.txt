XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Excellent! I was a bit apprehensive eating here because it is a celebrity chef restaurant and a chain, but being a fan of Bobby Flay and having heard good things I had to try it. I was very pleasantly surprised, the staff were great, very knowledgeable and very welcoming. 

The food was delicious, we had the Ahi Tuna and the green pepper cioppino as well as the brussels sprouts as a side dish. Being a big lover of good cioppino the green pepper base really intrigued me, venturing out of the traditional tomato base, and it was brilliant! I do not know how to describe it without not doing it justice so I will just say go eat it, it is the best cioppino I have ever had, the fish, scallops, and lobster that were in it were cooked perfectly and the green pepper broth was so delicious, so so delicious! Aside from the cioppino the Tuna was also very good, and the brussels sprouts were cooked with pomegrante seeds which was seriously tasty. 

All in all, when in vegas there are a ton of options to eat at, but you should eat here!
