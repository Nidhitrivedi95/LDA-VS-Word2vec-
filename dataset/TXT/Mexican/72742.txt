Cd2ERofxOeCbCi-0yDs0aw I love frybread, so if I see a sign that says FryBread then I have to try it and I'm glad I did. This place has such great customer service from the moment you walk in and the frybread taco itself was amazing! Good portion, good seasoning and spice and a perfect crispy, fluffy frybread. This is a must try at a  good price too! Go check them out people!! They even have a drive thru..oh and free yummy tortilla chips!
