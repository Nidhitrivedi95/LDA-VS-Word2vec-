OPcGFLP_mRt9yvgP3ALXOQ This place has delicious food!!! Great Mexican food with dishes you usually dont see in other spots. The Skinny Tacos were delicious. Chicken was savory and tender. It came as a surprise bc we asked for a dish that was more vegetarian (chicken the protein of choice), with no dairy. We had a salad with chicken and asparagus. It was fantastic! 
The margaritas were delicious. And the staff were super friendly and accommodating. I had so much salsa, I am surprised they had any left! 
Loved the space too. Very nice energy. Any place that has live plants is a huge plus!
