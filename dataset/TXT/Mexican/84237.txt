D5XFDNEuLQoLbokLeznaOQ Ordered the house burrito and quesadillas for lunch.   Prices were reasonable, service was friendly but a bit on the slow side for a food cart.   Product got the job done.   Burrito didn't feel like street food because it was very messy to eat and required a fork and knife.   Overall, not a bad option in the area if you are specifically looking for Tex Mex, but I suspect some of the other food carts with longer lines probably offer a better experience.
