JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg Went here for my birthday.  It was crowded.  The high top table my party was seated at was not too conducive to chatting with anyone seated at the end.

I had the veggie tacos at an event at violettes vegan, and they were great, at the restaurant, they were just ok.  Everyone else enjoyed their food. A great group of people, a good time was had by all.
