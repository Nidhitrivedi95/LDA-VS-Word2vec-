7Q2cYSl5NBYytJzgjX0oKw First time here. Food was good, service (Michelle) was awesome.  The concierge thing in the bathrooms was somewhat weird.  However, the resaon I will not go back is because they allow smoking.  I hate the smell of smoke and expecially despise it while trying to eat.  We were there for lunch, but I get the feeling it turns into a meat market at night...just saying.  And the music can be loud, even at lunchtime.  Please get rid of the smoke!
