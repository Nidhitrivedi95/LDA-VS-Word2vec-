UtZgmOHDW_fbXasbTuZhWA So far so good. Friendly service, speed of food delivery ok, cold drinks and clean bathrooms. Our visit was on Saturday noontime, no wait to order and plenty of seating. They staff a lot of employees, order takers, food runners and general dinning room oversight/managers to re-fill drinks and dispose of dirty dishes. FYI- all the items are customizable, as in you can remove highly caloric ingredients from a dish if you eating low carb or watching calories. To get our science right checkout the website or app. Both my hubby's bowl and my salad came out exactly as ordered- so two thumbs up on that attention to detail. Sign up for the VIP app, got $5 off the first order and then after I logged my points, I get a free drink for the next visit.
