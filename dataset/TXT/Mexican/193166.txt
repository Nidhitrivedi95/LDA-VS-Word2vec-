oOGLDf2rzeCPS7UQ8hhPlQ I got to check off one of the things on my "Must Try" list while visiting TO, which was a sushi burrito - yayyyyy! 

Although I should have gone fully authentic and gotten one within a nori wrap and rice, I wanted a light pre-dinner (aka 1st dinner for myself) snack so I went with their summer salmon roll which was salmon and veggies wrapped in rice paper. So essentially a giant salad roll.

Everything in it was super fresh, the fish, veggies, mango and masago. I wasn't expecting the ginger and it was a sinus clearer for sure lol

My only suggestion is to wrap the ingredients a bit tighter in the rice paper. That way, everything isn't falling out and you don't look like a hot mess eating it.
