DO5mQxiBOgHEznosjxvJXw I know what you're thinking.  Mexican food at the Boulevard Mall... The Boulevard Mall???  But really, I don't give out four-star for nothing, so it may be worthwhile to go and here's why. 

First thing first, it has its own entrance from the outside to the restaurant.  That's always been one of my major concerns - what if the mall closes before I leave the restaurant...  I don't want to spend the night at any malls, let alone the Boulevard's.  

They also have an "outside" patio that's actually al fresco to the inside of the mall.  So, yes, you can people watch or be watched by the mall-goers.  Either way, it's awkward fun. 

And then there's the food.  It's a modern take on Mexican food that's not offensive.  I personally think most fusion or modern food is unnecessary and culturally offensive.  However, Olivia's straddles the fine line between creativity and preserving each dish's element of essential flavors.  

This is what I remember what we had that was good: steak tartare pizza, calamari and scallops.  Our server asked if we wanted any dessert and we declined.  A couple minutes later, he returned with a mango mousse - compliment of the house.  It was good and refreshing.  

We tried other dishes too but I cannot recall what they were anymore.  Old age may be to blame or the delicious margarita I had at Olivia's that's currently on my mind.  Either way, I intend to refresh my memory by going to Olivia's again.
