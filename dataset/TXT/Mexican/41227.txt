We went for happy hour in a Friday and it wasn't too busy. We had fish and carne asada street tacos with a side of rice and beans. The tacos and guacamole were AMAZING, the margaritas were strong but not over powering and the Spanish rice was good. The only thing to comment was the refried beans were very bland but a little salt made them up just right. The waitstaff was pleasant and so cute with the red flowers in their hair this is defiantly our new go-to place for a quick Mexican food and drinks. Great place to take out of town guests and there is plenty of parking. I can't wait to sit outside in the patio as soon as the summer heat is gone! The rest of the menu looked good and we can't wait to go back.
