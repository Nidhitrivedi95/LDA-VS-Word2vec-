R6cWq0FkVfV_Ee-YttlPyA Staff are pretty rude, they are rushing through orders not reading the tickets properly-I was charged extra for avocado and cheese, but they were so buck rushing through orders that I didn't get either avocado or cheese. They also put fries and corn into the burrito bowl even though neither are called out on the menu-what's with adding items you don't have listed as ingredients? I don't recommend this place.
