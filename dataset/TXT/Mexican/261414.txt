VtKYA6Fu1jTDrEhDHRlUvg So I ordered a burrito from there via Postmates and when I got it, it was so spicy that I got sick off two bites and my mouth was a blaze. So I drove to them and had to wait in line forever and when I finally got to the front And explained the situation and the older lady just walked away from me talking Spanish with hella attitude to the other girl (younger) and carried on doing something else.. leaving me standing there. So very politely I asked what was going on and she snapped at me and said "can you wait a minute please??" So I closed my eyes trying not to lose my temper and when she finally came back I asked for a refund. She said no, so I asked if I could at least have something else worth the same amount, she said "no I can't do that, sorry." And I flat out said "so i just wasted my money then right?" And she said "the best I can do is two free tacos" and handed me a coupon for them. So I was like "okay fine I'll take the tacos" and they were hella bomb but this old lady was so rude. The younger one was sweet. So if you go here, sample what you're getting before you buy because once your money hits their hands, you're not getting it back and they won't do you any favors by remaking your order.
