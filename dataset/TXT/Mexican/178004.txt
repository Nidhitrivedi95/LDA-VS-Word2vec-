muefnimyq_3KIdEouJFvrA Perhaps my expectations were too high; regardless, they were not met.  The girl working the bar had no business working the bar, but I suppose we all had to start somewhere.  Ordered one beer, got something totally different, and she never caught on despite several comments about it not being what was expected.  Food was okay (at the time*), but nothing to write home about.  Late-night happy hour specials (appetizers) were reasonable; normal prices compared to the food we got would be a bit high.  And if you wonder why the "at the time" comment, it's because I spent a significant amount of time on the toilet the next morning.  Pretty sure the food was the culprit, and the leftovers I brought home went straight from the fridge to the trash.
