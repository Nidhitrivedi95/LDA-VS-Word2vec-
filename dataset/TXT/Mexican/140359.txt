j7Rgozl24WrmDeqFCCKwQg Ordered delivery a few times here. The porker burrito, usually with cheese fries too. The burrito is massive and delicious, good for 2 meals or 1 very fulfilling one haha. Staff seem friendly, if you've made a weird burrito on your online order, they'll call to confirm with you to ensure a good burrito that isn't soggy. The cheese fries are my guilty pleasure. Highly recommended for a lazy afternoon feast at home, noms.
