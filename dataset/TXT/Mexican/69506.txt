I got the guac and thr fajitas. There was nothing slecial about either of them. But the guac was decent....or maybe i was hungry. The fajita rice was hard and the beans lacked flavor. Very underwhelming experience.

The margaritas were essentially juice. Womp. I came here with a group of 5 people and we all shared similar sentiment.

Its a pretty big space and because of the loacation i'm sure its always busy. But if I were you go elsewhere.
