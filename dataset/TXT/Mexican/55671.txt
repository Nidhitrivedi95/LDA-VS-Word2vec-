If you have any experience with taco/burrito stands in SoCal, you're likely to be disappointed. I've been here several times since it's opened, always going back to see whether they've figured things out yet, and sadly they have not.

The burritos are certainly very fresh, but they somehow lack in the flavor department. Perhaps there's just no love being put into them, which would make sense, as the staff is consistently slow, unattentive, and generally more interested in bros'ing it out than dealing with line-up.

The tacos, however, are usually pretty solid, and I'd recommend those if you're going to eat there. Above average tacos, though, aren't enough to justify a visit -- especially at the price point and given the customer service.
