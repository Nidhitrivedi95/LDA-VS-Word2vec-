JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg It was a good little restaurant, right next to a gentlemens club if that's what you're looking for. The restaurant was ok, nothing super amazing. I was with family, we had a couple of tacos as well as some rice. It was good, not necessarily super authentic Mexican food, and not really a modern take on it either. The flan was amazing - must try.
