MQEpDvkdL39hh1N0We3Vaw Went on a $2 Taco Tuesday. So at least I didn't spend too much on the meal because it was not good. 

I got one asada taco and one blackened fish. All I can say about the asada taco is TASTE.LESS. It takes a certain level of skill to somehow suck the flavor out of otherwise flavorful things. As for the blackened fish taco...this one had more taste, unfortunately is was of a metallic variety. Not sure if that taste was coming from the fish or the cabbage but it was mighty strong. On a positive note the tacos are of a generous size and the waitress, while not very attentive, was really very friendly.

Not sure I will give it another shot, perhaps on another Tuesday. Also the name of this place is pretty dang gross. If you ever want to find this place even remotely appetizing do yourself a favor and DON'T look up 'Hot Taco' on Urban Dictionary....
