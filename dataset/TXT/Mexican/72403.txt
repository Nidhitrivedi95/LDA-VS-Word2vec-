cChJhpiljARaINk-dyXGiQ I ate here last night with my family. I had a salad which was small for the cost. Tasted okay. Everyone else ordered huge dinners which consisted of carnitas, fajitas, enchiladas, etc... They mostly complained about the tortillas being extremely gummy in texture and the salsa was very acidic, like it had gone bad. Today they are all sick. I am not sure how they are getting all these great reviews. The food was mediocre at best and prices were about average. The layout inside was weird and seemed shady. There was a disgusting mess under one of our booths. I won't be going back here again.
