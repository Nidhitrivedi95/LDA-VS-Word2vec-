OOHlm2lbVgPHhSe98YW3yA What's not good about this place?
I can't think of a damn thing. 

I had the California burrito with carne asada and it was the best carne I've tasted, EVER.
Not to mention those stacked tots, that's something to cry for. (Happy tears of course)

What compelled me to write this post was not the food (even though it deserves its own post) it was the quality of service. My burrito came out slightly later than the rest of the food that was served at my table so, a few minutes after getting my food, I was approached with an apology and an offer for a complimentary drink. SAY WHAT? That's right, this place is set with such high standards waiting even 5 more minutes is unacceptable. I really had no intention to complain, in my opinion, it wasn't even that long of a wait. But, the fact that I was approached was a breath of fresh air. 

EVERYTHING about this place is awesome. Your tastebuds will thank you twice over for putting this restaurant at the top of your list!
