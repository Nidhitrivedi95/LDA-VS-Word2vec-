IS-jwE9elsIZ0o1l3a1ILw This place is disgusting, placed and order online. Went to pick it up and it wasn't prepared. Then when I got it home to eat it I found a hair in my food. Took a picture and contacted the location who wanted the food back to issue a refund. I laughed because the remaining food was in the trash. The picture I took should have been enough proof. They will no longer have my business or that of my family and friends.
