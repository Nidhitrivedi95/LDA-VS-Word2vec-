RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg What's not to like about legit Mexican tacos?  We've been to the Tacos El Gordo locations in Tijuana, MX and San Diego, CA, and this location is no different in quality and taste.

Ordered the asada, pastor, and cabeza tacos.  You can't go wrong with any of these.

Only negative part was the price.  It's more than double compared to TJ, but hey, you're in Vegas, right?
