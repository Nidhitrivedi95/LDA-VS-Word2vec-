MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA I think I'm in love! It is only my second time here (not my fault - I tried coming during the renos!) 

This is seriously my gluten free heaven! So many delicious gf options - I'm not stuck with a blah salad!

Newly renovated, we went to the now winterized patio...I did have some drops of rain fall through the tarp that shielded us from being drenched but that's a small price to pay for this place!

My only issue with the patio is that there's NO MUSIC (caps so that they see this and hopefully add some music to the patio!) The music they play inside is awesome and as always, creates a great atmosphere so hopefully they get some speakers going in the patio soon!

First off: The Tuna Ceviche is by far my favourite thing on the menu! It's light, zesty, filling and delicious! It has so much flavourand they do it so well!

Secondly: Don't go there without having their homemade corn tortilla chips and best guac I've ever had in my life (and yes, I have been to Mexico!)

Thirdly: Always ask for their appetizers, because it's not on the menu! I was told to have their Miami Ribs but when she told me the app menu they had pork ribs with peanut sauce.  She recommended the Miami Ribs but said they don't always have the pork ribs, so naturally I went for them! The ribs came in a set of 4 - definitely share those because I had 2 and a beef cheek taco (and quac and chips) and I was done!

Always happy with the service, everyone is so friendly, and you feel like you're just at a friend's place :)
