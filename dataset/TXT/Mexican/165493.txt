lnJlOuHGNRoN2zW_a6Vb7g In town for work from Denver (where the OG restaurants are) and had to come by to check out the new location. It did not disappoint. Kayla, who was the manager on staff, came and greeted me. She took the time to point of some of the new tacos to the Phoenix location. As always, the queso was delicious, the tacos divine, and the service prompt (Derek took excellent care of me). To all you Phoenix natives looking for a funky, tasty, and down-to-earth place to relax, stop by for a Marg and some truly unique tacos. Salud!
