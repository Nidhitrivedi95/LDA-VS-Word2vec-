SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA This is my first visit here. It's a Sunday night at 6 o'clock and it's very busy. Theres a 30 minute wait and we were seated in 15 minutes.  we didn't have to wait for our server to take our drink order and our food was served in 15 minutes. Guss, our server, was on top of things.

I went back last week and had the Fajitas and Margaritas. As expected, it was great
