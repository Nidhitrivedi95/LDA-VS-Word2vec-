bQ2uuNkOxgUQRM7Y7RJDXQ I have to say this was a Great Dining experience, we went with 2 other couples so we were able to sample many items Starters were Mexican street corn this is a delicious unique item, we also had a Shrimp cocktail that was out of this world we spent 20 minutes trying to figure out all the favors, last was a bean and cheese appetizer on a cast iron skillet. All our meals were above average. The Carne Asada, & Carnitas were the favorite and we also tried enchilada's. Last the Margaritas are to die for. Pricing of $ 5-8  for appetizer's and 12-15 for full meals with enough for leftovers is completely acceptable.
