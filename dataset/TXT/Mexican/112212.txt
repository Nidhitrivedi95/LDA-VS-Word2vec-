G6BwYw_0_atLPTzI1uokIA Last night I along with 7 of my friends and family had the pleasure of having a "special tasting event" here at Nacho Daddy.  I had won the this event through a auction that "Goodie 2 Shoes" foundation held in May. We had no idea what to expect, all of us thought we were gonna get some tequilas that we never heard of and a bunch of different kinda NACHOS.  Boy were we wrong... What we got was a 4 course meals paired with a tequila cocktail. Most of us who have been to ND in the past just go for nachos-n-drinks.  I'm not sure if they have the items that we had on their regular menu but just knowing they are capable of preparing this menu and executing it to perfection just say a lot of the restaurant. They even made accommodations for 1 of the party members who is vegan and had a special menu. Her food was identical to the rest but made of vegan ingredients. Compliments to the Chef de Cusine.  I'm not gonna explain each dish but i will say it was ALL delicious (will post pics).  Now, i dunno how one would experience what we did last night but if its something that you wanna try all you have to do is ASK!!!  Special shout out to our host that night "Sky and Austin" you guys did a awesome job with presentation and explanation of each course and pairing. Thanks for an amazing experience.
