This is now the second time we've been to this location and both times they didn't have the tortilla soup we wanted. Her response was "we stopped serving it tonight" so when we got up to the window we asked what time they stop serving it and rudely she replies "when we run out" and shut the window. This location needs to hire some friendlier people. Until then we won't be back. I rather drive farther for better service.
