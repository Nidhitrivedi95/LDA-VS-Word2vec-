LtO6vTBfYzlgWArn3kRe_A This is my go to place if I want delicious, flavorful, and decently priced tacos!  I used to frequent the Tacos El Gordo at their Charleston location, but lately I've been going to the Craig/Losee location because the Craig/Losee location is now closer to my work.  This location compared to the Charleston one is a lot bigger with two large dining areas with tables to enjoy your tacos at.  To get your tacos, you line up at the counter at three separate lines and tell the worker what tacos you want and how many.  Be sure to pay attention to the signs above each line because the separate lines serve different/certain tacos.  After you have obtained your tacos, you take it to the cashier to pay and then you can finally enjoy these delicious tacos!  
 
Usually 4 tacos is enough to fill me up, if I'm feeling particularly hungry I get 4 tacos for myself and the spicy adobada fries to share with my friends too.  For taco choices I highly recommend the spicy adobada tacos (spicy pork) and the carne asada (steak) tacos.  These are always solid and every person I've gone with here has enjoyed them as well.  If you are feeling a little bit more adventurous, I recommend the cabeza (beef head) tacos or the lengua (beef tongue) tacos, both flavorful as well.  4 tacos plus a drink is about $11.  You should definitely come here and enjoy some amazing tacos; I couldn't recommend this place enough!
