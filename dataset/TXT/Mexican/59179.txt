AhPmh0NaRDbEYyhd9egzLA This has been my girlfriend and I choice for date night for a few weeks now. We've always had great service and the food has always been exceptional. It's just all around a great place to be. It's a very chill environment with awesome food and great people, Clint the manager there has always made sure we're taken care of. The Carne asada is amazing and has been our cravings ever since we first tried it. The drinks are a bit pricey but very much worth it. We have yet had a negative experience and we've been on busy and slow nights and never got anything less than great service and great food. I'm glad to have found this place you guys are great and I plan on being there for years to come!
