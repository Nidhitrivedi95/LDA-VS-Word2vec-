K-uQkfSUTwu5LIwPB4b_vg Second time here while traveling for work. I love everything about this restaurant: the ambiance, the staff, the menu, the cocktails, and of course the chips and table side guac! It is truly an experience dining here. Definitely more of a celebration or fancy date night price point, or a great place to take a client! Get the guac, don't fill up on chips. Order the blood orange margarita. And yet anything on the menu. Just go!
