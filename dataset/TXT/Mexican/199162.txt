P8rCpSJ4uWNE__pypJsgGA I love nachos so I am set out to find the cities best nachos. So of course, why not try this place? It has the word "nacho" in the name, it HAS to have great nachos! WRONG this place by far had the worst nachos I have had yet in the city. Not only does this place have a small menu, which is fine, we ordered the veggie nachos, which are really hard to mess up. So when we get our nachos it is fried onions and peppers with a little bit of cheese. They were awful.

Aside from the nachos, I really like this place. Great place to have drinks with friends. It looks like a super fun. They also have chairs that are swings!! But I just think they really need to put some effort into their menu.
