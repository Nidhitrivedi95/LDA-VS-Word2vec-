BWsCjBVMR289vtojIz-gWw I love cafe rio it is so delicious! Unfortunately this one is always a mess! The servers are careless when scooping food so all the food is mixed in the different compartments. The trash is overflowing every time I've eaten here. I have never seen a worker cleaning off the filthy tables. With all of the complaints about cleanliness you would think that it would've improved by now.
