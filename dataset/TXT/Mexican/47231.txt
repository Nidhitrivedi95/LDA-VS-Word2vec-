7wP8ESOchbpzET2Li4H6UQ Taqueria cholula has the most authentic street tacos in the valley! I lived in Mexico for a couple of years and one thing that I miss more than anything is the food. Taqueria cholula was the one place that was able to fill this void in my life. I highly recommend the pastor tacos and the pastor quesadilla.
