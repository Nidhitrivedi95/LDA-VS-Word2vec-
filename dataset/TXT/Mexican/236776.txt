sW3oXGgDbbOC3YkiFKZNMQ Me and my husband dined in on 8-11-16 and it was a awful visit. First thing was they were out of the grilled veggies so I had to wait 10 plus minutes after they prepared my burrito,the second thing is that the steak was mostly fat and and was very tough, the third thing is that after Shayna rung up the order she asked if we had the rewards card my husband said no but, i would like one since we dine here often. Her respone was ok but, todays purchase wont be on there since i already rang up the order. This was very poor customer service all the way around. My burrito should have been comped since it wasn't ready till 15 minutes after my husbands order and she should have been able to give us credit for our order. Very disatisified customer. Hope to hear from someone soon
