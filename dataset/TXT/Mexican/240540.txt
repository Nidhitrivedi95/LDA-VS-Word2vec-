T6pBz7Je2Bxz-Du_31LOwQ Having lunch today with my fiance anf my service dog. They allowed us to sit outside, even brought water for my dog. The service was fast and friendly. Food came out quickly. I have been here a few other times and it is always amazing. If you want some high quality Mexican  food, this sure is worth it.
