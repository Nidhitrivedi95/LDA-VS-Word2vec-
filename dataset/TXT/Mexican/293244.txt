yydyoWCY3LJYlPwVLKbJ3Q We came in for lunch, and the restaurant was pretty empty which should have been a sign that something was up when all the other Westgate restaurants were pretty packed. Upon our entrance the host which also turned out to be the manager was pretty rude to us as she sat us down. As we looked at the menu, and we asked about the specific drinks the host / manager / server told us "just look at the menu". At that point I decided to find the manager, and when the server told us it was her I asked if we could get a different server. The new server came up and it was the same overall poor attitude, we are heading out from we decided to get out of there. On the menu however, the prices of the drinks were absolutely exorbitant and there was not that much choice in regards to different food items available. For that reason we will never go back and will let everyone else know that there are other choices that would be much better than this restaurant
