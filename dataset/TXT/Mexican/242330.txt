Te-BqwJZt8S0fu9ltlq3Eg Good serving sizes, good service, food is run of the mill texmex. The carnitas was flavorful, chicken was cooked in a tomato sauce with onions. Service was good. Gummy worm margarita was fun, but bottled flavor mix it wasn't a great tasting drink. 
I gave them a 4 star for what it is, a local place with well priced food.
