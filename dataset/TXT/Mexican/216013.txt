R1k-z3Mauqk4v-7ZeEVsHQ Drove right past the parking entrance my first time past. Actually, many firsts tied to this visit to Guanaquito; first mid-week lunch date, first time having Salvadorian food, first ensalda and my first pupusa. Our drink order was taken and I tried the ensalada this was a sweet and refreshing citrus drink with small pieces of pineapple and papaya this was a perfect drink on a hot day. For an appetizer we tried the pupusa which are fabulous handmade tortillas that are stuffed with a variety of fillings, sampled the pork, cheese and bean - outstanding. For my entrée I had the Chile relleno. Hands down the best relleno I have ever tried. This version was stuffed with carrots, potato, pork and cheese simply scrumptious. 

Over-ordered for lunch and I'm enjoying the leftovers as I type this review - just as good reheated.
