YaTlfyPieOXwHH16wzieFg I am a fan of Cafe Rio's food. I love their sweet pork burritos enchilada style. Anyway this review isn't going to focus on the food because Cafe Rio is a chain. Instead this review is gonna cover this location itself. 

Why 3 stars? Inconsistent food quality. I come here quite often given how convenient the location is and Cafe Rio is admittedly quick easy food, especially when I want a burrito. Sometimes the rice is undercooked and weirdly hard. Sometimes the meat seems overcooked and difficult to chew. Sometimes the person puts a boat load of cheese and other times it's barely enough.

Other than that, not much to note. Overall pretty big storefront with lots of seating space. I've been here during prime lunch and dinner times and it can get pretty busy but the staff is usually friendly and they move the line quickly so the wait is never long. 

So yeah, basically I haven't had an issue with this Cafe Rio otherwise inconsistent food quality.
