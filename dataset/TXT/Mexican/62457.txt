aWYWNfHuQJyRwDHaHq8X1w This has to be the worst tasting salad I've ever had. The blackened chicken Cobb was just bad. The spices were awful and overwhelming. It had way too much tarragon. The chicken was so bad (overcooked and terrible taste) that the rest of the salad tasted awful; it infected the rest of it. The egg had ugly grey rings and tasted old.  The torta was OK.
