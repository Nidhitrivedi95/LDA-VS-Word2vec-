GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog Walking into China Poblano keeps your intrigue high as to this eclectic combination!  The red lanterns, bicycle wheels and long wooden tables take you into someone's childhood memory.  The small plate style and open atmosphere is unique and vibrant.  Almost every dish caused my mouth to water.  The dim sum/potstickers were incredible, barring the fact that the steamer was broken and the Har Gow and Xialonghao were unavailable (hence 4 instead of 5 stars).  The drinks were mixed perfectly and the service was beyond expectations.   Having only tried the Taco de Cameron, i can only imagine how amazing the others must be!  This was a great experience and one any foodie should so indulge!
