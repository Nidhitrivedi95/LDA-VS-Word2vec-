VXlK-DWw4ADR4TE7Eou5Dg I've been here twice and that's 2x too many. The first time was for dinner and the experience was like that Woody Allen line from Annie Hall: "The food in this place is really terrible. Yes, and such small portions."

Seriously, everyone complained about the mediocrity of their dishes then further moaned that there wasn't enough. This was across the board: burrito, quesadillas, and flautas.

My second visit was for the Yelp sangria crawl. Blech. My 9 year old niece could make better sangria--with Kool-Aid. Theirs was watery and insipid. No flavor at all. It was almost like they pre-mixed a big batch and let all the ice melt in the hot afternoon sun.

Even after two big gobletfuls, I wasn't the slightest bit tipsy. And I can usually get drunk just by looking at a glass of wine. Big FAIL.
