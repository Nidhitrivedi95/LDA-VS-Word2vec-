fDiyDg1pUetf9dMLFJ6oXw This Taco Bell is awesome. They just went over and beyond service when I stated 1 taco was missing from my order. Manager quickly got it taken car of no questions asked, got me another taco and then another in for free and topped it off with cinnamon twists as well as two free taco coupons!!! Not only that but food tasted fresh and better than any Taco Bell Ive been too. Whatever your doing, keep it up.
