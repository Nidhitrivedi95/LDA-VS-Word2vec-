TCoBE_BkDRrK0bWrh5VueQ My first few times here I loved the tacos. This last time was a let down. Nothing stood out and the ordering system is really annoying. Stand in one line get your taco, hold your tacos on a tray and they get cold while you wait in the next line, etc. There are a total of 4 lines plus a 5th to pay. That is a bit much if you want different things. 

The cashier was popping her pimples and then taking money and handing over cups. I don't know what other food items she touches, utensils? napkins? but I really wish people had a little more work ethic when it comes to working with food.
