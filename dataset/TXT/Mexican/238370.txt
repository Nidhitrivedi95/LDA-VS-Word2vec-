SZpzMUdhh1xu2qlegzSyLg Tortilla flats is a total dive but it has a decent patio. Super cheap drink specials- 9$ 3oz drink specials and 3$ tequila. Beergaritas are always a good time. The foods a bit of a miss, it's all deep fried and not authentic but the Texas fries are really good. Service is generally a bit slow.
