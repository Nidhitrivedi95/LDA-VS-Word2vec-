Wnq5to0-jXyh0-_jRZ6VOQ This location of Z'Tejas gets four stars for happy hour and a convenient place to sit before a Sun Devils game (Go Devils).  

Typically, we visit the Chandler location of Z'Tejas.  In comparison, the Tempe location is not quite up to par.  

The check in process is laughable, with hostesses requesting your phone number to text you when your table is ready.  When you do give them your number, they either don't text you and just come find you or they forget about you altogether until you finally go check to see what the extended wait is about.  

The food on our last visit was hastily prepared.  The seared ahi tuna appetizer, for example, was not consistent in appearance to the many other times we have ordered it.  The chips served with the trio were stale.

On another recent visit, the ahi chipotle citrus bites were nearly inedible and the street tacos were served at room temperature.  Yikes.

What was on point?  The drinks!  The bartender here deserves props for consistently getting the drinks right and strong.

Also, the servers have always been very sweet and attentive here.

Will I come here again?  Of course.  During football season it is one of my favorite places to go.  Would I drive to Mill Ave to come here?  No.  The Chandler location is much closer and the kitchen is much more consistent.
