woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ One of my favorite places for food and drinks in the city. Spicy marg has the perfect level of heat. The atmosphere is fantastic as well as the service all the way around. I always have to get the tuna belly guac-a collision of my two obsessions. Octopus taco is also always a must for me. The only negative is how hard it is to get a table on a weekend!
