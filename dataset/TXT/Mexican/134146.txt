iIjVO7cLD1UEmIO7G05Ujw Cute cozy restaurant with a good atmosphere. They had a cute little pond with fish that gave it that unique touch. I came here for the menudo because I've heard it has the best. It was really tasty not as spicy which is perfect. I had a corona michelada because they were out of xx :/ , but let me tell you it was the best michelada I've had in months even better than the ones I make! I also ordered a cheese enchilada just to try, but I wanted a green one and got a red one :/. It was still good, but I've never been a fan of red so it's hard for me to judge it. My friend ordered a lemonade and I had a taste and it was delicious she thought it was a bit sour though. They also offered us salsa and chips and we of course said yes. The chips were warm so I can tell they made them there they were delish! The salsas were a little bland and lacked some seasoning. 

On a side note we were seated on a booth and it was super tight I did not have much room so maybe they should spread out their seating or next time I will not sit at a booth.
