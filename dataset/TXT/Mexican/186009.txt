nwHd2MbIGz0SNG8GpFjekw I had this for Taco Tuesday - where all their tacos are $1, except their Asada. The Pollo was kind of dry, but I normally don't get pollo tacos, so there's no comparison. The Carnitas was amazing and the Pastor was even better. Overall I had 5 tacos and I still wanted more. In addition, we made in time for Happy Hour and got a $4 House Margarita. That was also perfect - sour, strong, and barely taste the tequila. The service was also welcoming, helpful, and sweet. I'll definitely be coming back! Hopefully this will be my new go-to Mexican place.
