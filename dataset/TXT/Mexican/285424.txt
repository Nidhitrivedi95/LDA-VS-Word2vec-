y3RlbCN0UrDdLnjSF9NkXA So we went here for dinner . Not impressed with the service- drink order was wrong- margarita on the rocks was watered down and no lime . Maybe they were having an off night - but chips were cold and stale- chili relano was barely edible.  Salad was not brought  food was not cooked properly. No one checked on us- we ran out of beverage- check was plopped down - no dessert was offered.  For a $30 meal - was not impressed . Again - maybe it was an off night but will not come back .
