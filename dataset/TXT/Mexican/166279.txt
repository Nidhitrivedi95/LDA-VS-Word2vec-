lOQPeguczAueJnLmDUTfGg Bomb!!! However this rude waiter brought the check to my party and said outlays that both mine and my boyfriend was declined. That was upsetting and embarrassing. I'm from LA so our bank put out account on hold. He should've not done that infront of my family. He should've pulled us a side or in low voice. But he rather screamed out on purpose. We didn't like him btw. 

Other than that it was amazing! My bday surprise my bf got me was fantastic! Maybe mariachi every night would be nice.
