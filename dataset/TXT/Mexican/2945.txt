-lVLYkjJwCihTj4dlqZcNQ Went here while visiting friends.  Saw some good reviews so we thought we would give it a shot.  Ordered a round of Margarita's and they were ok... nothing to brag about.  Ordered our food and my friend ordered the chicken burrito and made them aware that she was allergic to onions.  Well, all the burrito had was chicken.  No cheese sauce, nothing!  So he asked for sour cream, which they eventually brought out.

My other friend and I ordered a variety of tacos, shrimp, fish and chicken and they too were just ok.  Had initially ordered them on corn tortillas, but they came out on flour.  No biggie because they eventually brought out a side of the corn, and they were very greasy!
