of4V8nfW7GwJ03tLDdrOlA Kevin, the bartender should probably find work that does not involve contact with other humans. What a joke...seriously can not understand how he would be hired...I blame Managment for that one. Food was pretty good. The Suizas was delicious and my waitress was very attentive for how packed it was for the 4th travel Rush. Sit away from the bar and you should be fine. Would have been 4 stars if he wasn't involved. Best bet may be for you to pack a lunch.
