b207RNqIAhTd4JsRsnXB1Q This place doesn't have the same feel as it did before it became Los Dos Molinos. Before, it was our go to place with friends for happy hour and dinner. With that said....

We wanted to like this place and visited a few times, however, in our opinion the quality of the food, drinks, and service went down. We ordered a cheese dip appetizer, it taste like it was from a can and microwaved. We weren't impressed with our dishes, the server wasn't good or attentive. We are all for supporting our local businesses, but unfortunately this place isn't for us.
