y6Fmhz2CceimbgvxNVgE-w Let's start by saying the food was not stellar.  They had a $7.99 lunch buffet with a decent selection.  I would say that the overall quality of the food is about what you would expect from somewhere that offers a $7.99 lunch buffet.  They had taco fixings, a few different fajita options, dips, chicken wings, fried shrimp... and some fried taquito things that resembled the frozen options from Trader Joe's.  

I ordered off the vegetarian menu (the buffet wasn't labeled very well-- no mystery meats for me!), and the cheese enchilada was meh.  The bean tostada was actually surprisingly good.  Their guacamole was not freshly made, and it appeared that someone may have simply mixed pico in with a mix. 

As far as drinks are concerned--I started out with a margarita, which tasted nothing like tequila.  It was very sweet, and I'm guessing it was about 99% mixer.  I opted for a draft Miller lite after this.  I like Miller lite, it's a good day drinking option... and what was served in that glass tasted nothing like Miller lite.  It had the distinct taste of a Yuengling, but not the correct color.  It smelled a bit like a Michelin Ultra... but had a small hint of a pilsner smell.  This leads me to believe that Los Arcos does not do a good job cleaning out their lines.  Needless to say I could not finish my 16oz beer.  

I give this 3 stars, because the actual amount of food you're able to consume with the lunch buffet makes it a good value... but if you're looking for some quality Mexican cuisine I suggest looking elsewhere.
