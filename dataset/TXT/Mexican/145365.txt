jhfyL3O-h2tcL8ZuyCU6WA After a Jays game we were looking for a late night taco shop that was walking distant within the financial district. We were recommended to go to  El Caballito as the closest one at King and Wellington right across the Roy Thompson Hall. Apparently it has a "sick patio"

So we walk into this gigantic well lit restaurant playing some groovy tunes and low lighting and asked for the patio. After a winding path that takes you upstairs we end up in "El Patio"

The concept is pretty cool. A bar, a food-truck and a few wooden booths in one end and a bunch of tables in between. You have to order your food at the bar and are given a number. The food is prepared in the food truck and brought to you by a server- so I guess I understand why they have their own name, social media page and all. As it is sort of its own entity that is attached to the larger restaurant. When I went on a Tuesday. Taco's were $3.50 each. I got the extra hot sauce. It had a serious kick to it. Some of the taco's like brisket had a little southern styled bbq taste to it. Which was somewhat interesting for a taco joint. I liked that they heated the taco shells so over time there would be some crunch to them.

I did enjoy myself and might return. However the food did not have the same WOW factor as grand electric. Not disappointed- but maybe i just have high standards. 

P.S- Checked in with Yelp and there was an offer for a free Margarita if I order over $25 worth of food. EASY!
