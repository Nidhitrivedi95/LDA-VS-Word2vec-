8a4ScB2OYz8uVtp1PWP5jg Seriously. I ordered one thing today around 2 with no line in the drive through. We were spoke to rudely to start. I ordered a bean burrito no cheese. It barely had beans in it so first two bites were only tortilla, middle bites yay (only) beans and the last disgusting bite literally was only onions. The lazy and/or low iq possessing person who made the burrito needs to get fired or given further special needs education.
