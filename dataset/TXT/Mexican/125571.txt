HtctU6CwYrKN3r2SL259EA Very disappointed! 

Got take out from here only to get home and find that they missed the tortillas, so all I got was the meat and veg. Called the location and the manager didn't even get on the phone to discuss the matter. All they said was "sorry". Needless to say that I will not be going back! 

By the way, I like onions, but man, the food that I had was overloaded with them!
