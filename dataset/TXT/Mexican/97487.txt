EjzMHfwqAmj7BgdzQjquRQ Lucky charm strikes again.  Lauren C. made the suggestion of Bandito for dinner.  She has great suggestions!

It was later in the evening on a weekday so it was easy to get seated immediately.  Our waiter, Carlos, was absolutely a gem all night.  He made us feel like VIP's with his service and charm.  His attentiveness was definitely noticed and appreciated.  

As per usual Mexican fare, complimentary chips and salsa were brought to the table.   Carlos asked us if we liked spicy salsa and offered to bring out their habanero salsa.   Holy spicy!  But it had a good flavor spicy which we all enjoyed.  My husband and I decided to split the Chicken Quesadilla as well as the Carnitas Enchiladas. The quesadilla was filled to capacity with chicken, charred heirloom tomatoes, caramelized onions and cheese.  The sweet caramelized onions lifted the flavors to greatness.  The dollop of guac and crema sauce gave a nice compliment to the appetizer.  

The enchiladas were no slouch.  The tender carnitas rested gently on top of the enchilada that is filled with cheese and your choice of sauce.  It is accompanied with the traditional pico de gallo, guac and crema sauce.  For our enchilada sauce option, we went with the habanero pepper sauce.  This wasn't nearly quite as hot as their habanero salsa but it still had a great kick and flavor.  The normal rice and beans came with it but the dish also comes with an additional choice.  Let's try the Off the Cob Mexican Street Corn!  Yes it was a great choice and would order again and again.

The kitchen was accommodating since my husband has a cilantro aversion.  All of our dishes were cilantro free and he deeply appreciated their awareness.  I'm excited for this unique kitchen and cantina.  Im already looking forward to my next visit!
