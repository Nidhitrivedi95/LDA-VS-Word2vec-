-kTHAUKuzh7cFZjVAW55Ug This is the worst Chipotle I've ever been to. I've traveled far and wide across this nation and even made it to the Steelyard one--their rude customers at least keep me entertained during the interminable wait!

Whether I come during lunch or after work or Sunday evening, the line is always absurdly long. Typically there is no chicken. Not really sure how this can be such a perpetual issue. If it happens literally every time I'm in here, maybe someone who works there should, um, tell the back to just make more chicken when they see a line of 20 people (which there always is)... Though I guess to their credit they yell nice and loud in my ear "WE NEED MORE CHICKEN" as soon as they scoop up the last chunk. 

The staff, while friendly and busy-appearing enough, are not the most efficient bunch. Your burrito/bowl chugs along slowly, its innards beginning to shiver between the inefficient handoffs. Usually at least one team member needs to leave to go tell the back they need more of something, and your poor burrito just sits there, naked. Ten minutes later your cold entree is served.

I am considering going back to the more expensive and less tasty option at work: hospital cafeteria food. It's at least faster, and more convenient, which makes me sad.
