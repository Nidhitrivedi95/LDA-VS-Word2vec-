xLy3aWEbtpoUSVdjuHBS0A To start off: I love Mexican food. My family loves it, and we all enjoy cooking it. The first time that I went here I had a coupon and enjoyed it immensely. The decor is beautiful. The original margaritas are delicious. The food is delightfully plated and tasty. Since my first visit, I try to go fairly often. It is usually busy and the staff is rushed. But like most places, you need to have some patience and enjoy dining out. It is a treat and I usually try to get something new every time we go there. I highly recommend the jumbo original frozen margarita with salt on the rim. It is huge and a little pricey but totally worth it. For meals, the Burritos are always a good choice. They are always delightfully cooked.
