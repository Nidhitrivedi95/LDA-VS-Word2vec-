2XaCV8VwXuJAmyqif0_RVA I have been to this restaurant several times in the past and this is the first time I'm reviewing it. 

La Familia is a Mexican restaurant that serves a variety of Mexican food like burritos, tacos, Menudo and many other items.

The food taste really good and the portions that you receive are more than fair. I bought a wet burrito this time $8.60 it has a lot of meat in it and is a pretty big size,enough to fill one adult. I recommend taking cash because if you use your debit card or credit card you will be charged a $.50 fee


The restaurant itself is not a big place it's a small place with enough seating room for roughly 20 to 30 people, I have never seen the restaurant filled to where there is no seating as the majority of customers order the food and go home especially if there is  a large group they might be able to accommodate you but then again they might not.


Overall La Familia it's a nice little restaurant with really good food, I give this place a 3.5 star rating because of the quality of food and the portions you get.
