o2nt0ZJP0WmdDL-4HV-p4w Amazing food, and incredible service! We've come several times since they've opened and everyone always greets us like we're returning family members. The food is just as awesome! Tried many parts of the menu and it's always been consistently the best food in Vegas. Could not give a higher recommendation and I look forward to coming back with my family over and over again.
