yz66FIUPDKGhILDWzRLeKg Was in the neighborhood and stopped for lunch. Sat at the bar and Brenna was our bartender/server.  She was absolutely fantastic! Personable and a pleasure to get to know. We had enchiladas, an adovada burrito and the habenero margs. Great meal and an awesome experience! We will definitely be back!!
