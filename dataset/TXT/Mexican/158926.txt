ksuxxeP_V73Y4iKPeLq77A Food was alright.  A little pricey but then again your in vegas. Appetizers were about $15 bucks and a catilac margarita was $12. When we got the bill we were a little upset to see a 17% gratuity added to our check of 7 ppl for bland, unenthusiast and dull service.  It was definitely not worth it!!!!!
