T2tEMLpTeSMxLKpxwFdS3g I was so excited to try this place! But I was a little underwhelmed. The wait was longer than we were quoted so that wasn't a great start. Our waitress was nice and pretty attentive. Unfortunately the chips were rather stale but the salsa was tasty. The food came out quickly but wasn't very warm which was a big bummer. In general the side dishes all needed salt except for the avocado pasta salad which was good. Overall it just didn't live up to the expectations I had been given.
