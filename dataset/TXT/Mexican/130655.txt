ibf4xvHWD4t1DOOZhidHBg Modern Margarita is a super fun urban spot in the middle of High Street near desert ridge. The atmosphere is super fun and bright!

Since there was a pretty large group of us, we ordered the tray of 15 tacos. It included everything from fish tacos to veggie tacos to chicken tacos and carnitas. It was suuuper good, and great for the group because there's a little of something for everyone. We also ordered a side of fries with chipotle lime aioli. 

I didn't order any beer or margaritas, but other people at my table ordered some of the local beer and they said it was great! The service was ehh, but I'll cut them some slack because it was a busy Saturday night. 

I went here with a group of 6 people, including 3 small children. While the atmosphere is super fun and loud, I don't think this is the place to bring kids - there's not many options for them and little to keep them entertained unless you brought something from home.
