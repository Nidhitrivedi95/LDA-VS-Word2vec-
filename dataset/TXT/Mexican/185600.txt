nveeiYhDhj0WJu1JUmx9fw I ordered "take out" from here and was impressed with the staff that took my order over the phone and how attentive they were when we got there.  At least 3 employees asked us if we had been helped.  We ordered the cheese enchiladas, rice and beans and the green chili pork burrito, rice and beans.  The green chili pork burrito was awesome!! The red cheese enchiladas were not spicy enough so none of us would order that again,  but we would order it again with the green Chile Verde sauce.  The chips and salsa were also fantastic.  I liked the beans but not so crazy about the rice.  The kids did like the beans and rice but mostly because when they sent it to go, the container actually separated the beans and rice from the enchilada and burrito.  Their complaint was that there wasn't enough beans and rice.  I will go back and try anything with green Verde Chile on it. Great food for a casual place with a nice atmosphere.  The outdoor patio would also be nice around this time of year.
