Sv1XtPN-utoenqdIn9ZMyQ I was in town for a week, staying at the holiday inn around the corner and was looking for a good Mexican place close by. The reviews looked great on Yelp, so I managed to stop by on Thursday around 4pm for a late lunch. I was the only customer at that time, but the server was super friendly and service was very fast. I got the chiles rellenos, which were amazing, with corn tortillas and horchata (got a free refill too!). Super authentic, quick and delicious! I ate it all and was completely stuffed. Will definitely try to make it back next time I'm in town.
