T-m667xSiQysC_mokXM0yA This location is one of many Roberto's in the area, but is the one I visit the most
-the food is good, not great
- the staff is nice and service is prompt
- location is clean, never disgusting like some other Roberto's
- they take care to always handle special orders well 
-their drinks are actually really good. I love the Jamaica and the piña here more than some other places
- they take phone orders, which amazingly, some Roberto's do not
- their shrimp burritos are spicier than most other Roberto's in town

Not the best Mexican food you'll have, but you won't be disappointed if you're eating here.
