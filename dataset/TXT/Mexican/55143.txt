After waiting for a little more than expected, he popped his head out and said sorry it is taking so long what would you like to drink on the house, so he gave me a large Pepsi and all this time he was pretty nice about everything. 

I finally get the Chorizo Burrito and it is pretty good, a little on the spicy side but not overly hot.

First time I went ti this location and it is not to far from home
