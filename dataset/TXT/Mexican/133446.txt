iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg I've been on a search for a good taco al pastor since having my first taste in Mexico in 2002. I have searched up and down the coast of California (where I am from) and all over Toronto. I can say with confidence that these are the best tacos al pastor I have had outside of Mexico. I've been back over and over again since discovering they've added these to the menu. Besides the tacos al pastor, everything else on the menu is as good or better than my favourite taco stops in Cali.
