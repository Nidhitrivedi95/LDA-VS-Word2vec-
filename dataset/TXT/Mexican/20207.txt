1ZJz840L496LAmQdeDv0WA At least this place lives up to it's name...in the derogative sense. Pinches Tacos was a huge disappointment. The carne asada had a funny taste to it. I'm guessing it was over seasoned. And what is up with the extra .50 cent charge for carne asada? This is the first place. Shrimp, I  get it. Fish, of course. But for carne asada that isn't asada? No...it's not grilled, pinche tacos were disgusting. And by the way, this is a real mexican writing this review.
