Details: El Dorado Benedict is delicious, and the waffles too, especially with fruit. Service is uniformly slow. Wait staff might see you once at most in the 40-60 minutes between placing your order and receiving your food. Look forward to another ten minutes just waiting for someone to run your card. Nary an apology or word of concern for the wait. Wait staff aren't overtly rude; they just don't seem to give a rat's ass about you or notice that you're there. This is not a one-time opinion -- I've been there 4 times for brunch (the food is worth the trip); each time the service has been the same, across multiple servers and times. A shame, since their menu is wonderful. Their management would do well to add some cooks, change their waiters, or both. 

In summary, go for a leisurely and tasty brunch, but make sure you enjoy your company, because you'll be chatting with them for a long long time.
