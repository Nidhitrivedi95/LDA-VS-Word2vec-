_IsmLuyEvcKzcBmbMHCCfg If by some bizarre circumstance, you ever find yourself unsure of what city you're currently in, the surefire way to identify if you're in Phoenix Arizona (besides the infamous dry heat) is that about every third major intersection, you'll find a drive-through Mexican restaurant of questionable quality with outdoor seating all with a single-word name ending with "Berto's".  You might see a Filiberto's, a Rigoberto's, a Humberto's...I'm sure if you looked long enough, you'd probably even come across a Bertoberto's somewhere!

Julioberto's, on the Northeast corner of 19th Avenue and Thunderbird, is one such eatery.  There are a couple notable things that set it apart.  Not only do they have indoor seating, but the indoor portion is the bulk of the space - there's just a few of the requisite outdoor tables available along the side of the restaurant.  Another major thing in its favor is that they're open 24 hours - both the indoor seating and the drive-through.

The food is generally better than those of its contemporaries.  I especially enjoy their rolled tacos with guacamole. their super nachos, and taco salads.  They have several combo plates all with the ubiquitous sides of rice and beans between six and nine dollars with a daily special each weekday at $4.99.

Still, there's no hiding that this is still essentially a "dive".  If you use the door facing Thunderbird, you'll notice a prominent crack across the bottom pane - that's been that way for years!  As long as I can remember, actually.  You definitely want to avoid using their restroom.  While the food is usually okay when you're in the mood for cheap Mex, you should nonetheless be advised to "eat at your own risk" since one time after eating here, I ended up with an extremely nasty case of food poisoning - the main reason I've ranked them only two stars.
