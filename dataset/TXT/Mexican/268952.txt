wOk2b8zUHWylJOd6FtNsRw Worst Mexican burrito I have ever had. Julian, the waiter, couldn't get my husband's order right. Tacky dining areas with bookshelf in front without any meaning. Looks like they tried to create vintage vibe but were too cheap, so bought old furniture from yard sales. 

So the burrito - it was ground beef burrito with supposedly cheese and onions. Not much cheese or onions, but tortilla was two-fold. Ground beef was overly ground with watered down spices. Chipotle seems amazing in comparison.
