EjzMHfwqAmj7BgdzQjquRQ Food was very lackluster. The guacamole was under-seasoned and over-limed. The street corn was okay. I have zero clue to how a place can charge $17 for carnitas & al pastor tacos (only two tacos). I despise the restaurant chain Chile's, but they actually have better food than Bandito. The Chips and salsa suck too. Overall: stay away. Better off going to any other place or starving yourself than eating at Bandito.
