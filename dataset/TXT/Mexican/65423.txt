b8ublvizuqIw3Ib8pK4fDw I'm a big fan.  Of both their brunch and dinner.  Verde's super modern and funky design is just a fun place to dine, and their wall of tequila is super instagrammable.  I have yet to have anything on the menu that I didn't really enjoy.  I'm salivating thinking of their verde salsa and the huevos benedictos in their special hollandaise. 

If I had to pick a least favorite it would be the bbq pulled pork tamales. And that was mainly because they were a bit too expensive for what they were, which was delicious but since they were a special and the price was not listed I felt sort of duped when we got the check.   

I actually always feel a little surprised at the check, it's a bit more than I'd really like spend, but I'd rather pay a little more and have it be awesome than get stuck eating something like that steel cactus debacle.

Tips: try the classic verde marg before you go exploring on the rest of their variations, but it is seriously perfect.
