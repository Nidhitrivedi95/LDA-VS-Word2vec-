VuIIfIAEtGFXcAcXCvK-1g It was about 12:30pm and this semi-new burrito place had only been open 2 hours. They claimed that had run-out of pork and chicken already. Let's be honest, whoever ships their pork and chicken never showed up. Why bother lying to customers when you screwed up. Only real BBQ places run out of food early. Whoever owns this place should be embarrassed about that situation.
    Luckily, the food they did have turned out average. One person had the steak burrito and it was a bit spicy, but the steak was lean and the burro had good flavors. My carne asada quesadilla at $8.79 might have been a touch overpriced and was really nothing special. The carne asada was lean and they gave you the sour cream and salsa on the side, but it was still a rather mundane quesadilla. These folks opened up another restaurant next door, but I would call ahead to make sure they didn't run out of any items that you might want.
