Pros: immensely cheap prices, regular specials, friendly service, plenty of seating, more "authentic" taste and feel

My first experience with El Charro was a good one. They were having a month-long '$1 taco' special and so I ordered 5 tacos (credit/debit card minimum is $5): 2 chicken, 1 steak, 1 lengua, and 1 chorizo. All tacos come with onion and cilantro as well as complimentary chips and salsa. The tacos are small but that's fine given the price. The tortillas used for the tacos are fantastic.

Lengua - I was pleasantly surprised with the lengua, as I am aware that lengua quality varies largely across restaurants. Although the meat was sparse and it wasn't as good as you'd find in a larger city like Chicago, it was more than acceptable.

Steak - This had to have been my least favorite. The whole time I was eating this taco I thought it was my chorizo taco. The meat is so finely cut it starts to resemble ground beef. The meat lacked flavor and was sparse, same with the lengua.

Chicken - I have mixed feelings about chicken. It was not typical chicken you'd get at a Mexican restaurant, but instead comes in small cubes. It does the job and tastes fine, but it leaves a bit more to be desired.

Chorizo - A bit greasy but you get the chorizo taste. Acceptable.

All in all El Charro was a good experience. Although I warn that I would not be surprised if the quality/experience was not as consistent as say Maize or Burrito King. Recommend.
