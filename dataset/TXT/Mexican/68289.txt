Bk_5n1l2_Rn_qvRRHFk1pg Loved the Burrito ! I came with some friends to the next door pub, which doesnt serve food so we went to grab a bite and well this was next door. The food is not cheap 9-11$ per dish but it is worth it. I had the Vege burrito and it was seasoned and spiced perfectly. If you like spicy food ask in advance mine was mild and altough it was huge it was so good I could have eaten another. If I am ever in the area again I will surely stop there.
