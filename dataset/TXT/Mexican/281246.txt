XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg We had reservations and were seated quite promptly.  They brought out a bread basket filled with cornbread adn sourdough bread that had some kick to it - that was pretty tasty.

Appetizers --
Raw Tuna Nachos -- yum, small portion tho
Tiger Shrimp and Roasted garlic Corn Tamale - I usually don't like tamales, but i surprisingly really liked this one.  Very tasty.

Entree --- 
New York Strip Steak medium rare --- I got it because it was their 2nd signature dish (the first beign the pork tenderloin, but our server said teh pork tenderloin was really spicy and i have a low tolerance for spicy foods).  Ugh.  It was dry and not very flavorful -- and i HATED the sauce it came with.  Had a strange taste to it.  I swiped my meat with the cranberry compote that came with my friend's lamb dish ( OMG SO GOOD... i only had a bite, but i wish i had ordered it - it was juicy, tender and cooked perfectly and i liked the cranberry sauce that came with it) 

Dessert -- dessert sampler --- i liked teh empanadas teh best because it came with yummy ice cream.  the chocolate cake was ok at best, i've had more decadent ones... and i didn't care for the burnt orange cheesecake -- just tasted like burnt sourness.

I would've given t his place 5 stars if i had the lamb instead of the strip steak.....
GET THE LAMB - AVOID THE STEAK

i wasn't that full when i left, but then again, i eat a lot.
