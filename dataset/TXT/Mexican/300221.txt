zMfZLd5_h5W8ZVxTNoeJyQ Went there for lunch yesterday. There were very few tables when we arrived yet it still took a while to be greeted by our waiter. We ordered the queso con chorizo appetizer which I've gotten before and loved. It was actually the reason that I selected Steel Cactus for lunch--I was craving the queso. The appetizer came out and the cheese was bright yellow--looked like velveeta and tasted awful. When the waiter came over I asked if the recipe had changed. He stated that the recipe had not changed but was sometimes inconsistent?? Not sure exactly what that meant.  I told him we didn't want the queso because it just wasn't good. He apologized and took it back to the kitchen. Within 5 minutes he brought back a new bowl of the queso which was white in color and tasted the way it was supposed to. I'm still so confused as to what and why we were served the first mess. Then as I was about to take a drink from my iced tea, my boyfriend asked what was in the glass. It was a piece of sticky paper stuck to the inside of my glass--which I had drank out of several times already. Gross. 
I've been to Steel Cactus about 6 times prior to yesterday and always had a good experience. In fact, yesterday was my birthday and this is where I opted to dine. Needless to say, it was a disappointment.
