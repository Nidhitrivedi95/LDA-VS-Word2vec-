_vTXSMispis4Q5wCJykJkQ So, I have been coming here on and off throughout the last 2 Years. The food hasn't changed but this is not my reasoning for leaving this Yelp with only 1 Star. 

They have the atmosphere of a great Mexican style restaurant, however the cleanliness of their utensils and drink-ware are always a problem. I gave this place a rest for a couple months HOPING that things would change. 

However, to my dismay I came back with my buddy for lunch ordered a cheese quesadilla with rice and beans. My buddy had to ask the waitress for a whole new utensil placement cause there was caked on food, she sarcastically said "oh someone already ate on it" 

Thinking that was the end of the dirty dishes I started eating my food when it arrived I took a couple of sips of my soda and as it got a little lower I noticed something on the cup, taking a quick glance thinking it was from the salsa on the outside. But as I picked up the cup the caked on food was on the inside. How do I know this was not mine was clear as I have been using a straw the whole time. 

That was it I didn't eat anything anymore or drink anything. So this is why the 1 Star.

So to the owner/manager, please advise your dishwashing crew to first rinse off all food before placing it in the dishwasher. And second to whomever your waitstaff is, please have them observe the utensils that they are wrapping to ensure that the dishwashing crew are doing their job. 

It's a team thing not just one person. I did my part by informing our waitstaff however this should never be an ongoing issue.

I will not be returning to this establishment sadly, however to whom ever goes there please be observant in the overall experience of your dining.

Thank you
