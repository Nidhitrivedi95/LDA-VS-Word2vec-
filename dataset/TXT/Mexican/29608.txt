42TGx8KatGNPCi7rwOzazg I was hoping this place would be my new fav but I was disappointed. Food was not to my liking, over priced and the service was not very good. Busy place so I'm assuming that is why our waiter left us parched for drink refills. The chips were not very good as far as chips go in a Mexican restaurant, and we only got them after the waiter asked if we wanted some cheese dip or guacamole and was charged $9! 
If I return I will be ordering only cocktails (on the specials menu) and maybe a kids meal as those seemed pretty well priced and ok.
