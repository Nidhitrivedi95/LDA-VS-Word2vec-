4j0WfdS_lHG9uSH7cd1PFg Ate here for lunch. Menu is self explanatory. It actually says step 1 and step 2. Basically, it's a build your own whatever kind of place. You have a choice of a taco, burrito, small burrito, quesadilla, burrito bowl, tostada bowl or a torta. Chicken, pork or steak are the meat options. Let me tell you, the meat flavor is what sets this place apart from the others. I ordered the spicy pork tostada  for me and a chicken taco for my friend. The meat is not dry and it really is tasty. Also comes with rice, beans, salsa, cheese. They had shredded Oaxaca cheese!! 
They play cool music and have day of the dead art on the walls. There's a reward program so sign up to accrue points.
