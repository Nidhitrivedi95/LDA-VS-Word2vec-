HTlsBAd9j1wlWDHxnYczBw La Fonda is located next to Oregano's on Shea.  It's a small little Mexican restaurant, but the food is really good.  The salsa is delish and the margaritas can always bring a smile to my face.  They're really strong, like a good margarita should be, and purchasing a pitcher of them mid-day when I should be working, makes them taste even better.

The waiters are friendly and fast, and I've never had a bad experience there.  It's a casual place, so you can come dressed however you want, and it's the perfect spot for a quick meal.  I've never had to wait for a table either- which is good for me, but probably not so great for the restaurant. 

A couple of times, I've come here instead of going to Oregano's when they have their two hour wait going on, and I'm always glad I did.  Give it a try next time you're in the area!
