M8S7poDhCIzqQx1--GB-ww I came for brunch on Saturday with some friends. The decor style is kind of retro diner, but with lots of pastel colors. The staff were very courteous and professional.

We started with the donuts, which were piping hot and perfectly covered with the right amount of cinnamon and sugar. I ordered the pork belly with pineapple glaze and eggs. The pork belly was roasted so tender that the layers of meat fell off one another, yet the skin was still crispy. It was heavenly. The sides didn't let the pork belly steal the spotlight though. The portions were generous and the varied textures between the rice & beans, slaw (kind of spicy), and tostones made for a powerful brunch combination. 

I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu!
