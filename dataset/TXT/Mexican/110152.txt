Fvd8qeJCXFbMYQk45S7iBQ My husband and I enjoyed this place very much. The food was very tasty and satisfying. We ordered the sampler and everything on that plate was delicious. Our server was also very pleasant, he was attentive and quick with the drinks (which is a must for my husband). It wasn't crowded so we had a nice intimate meal but even when busy, the booths provide adequate privacy. Loved the decor and ambiance. We will be back!
