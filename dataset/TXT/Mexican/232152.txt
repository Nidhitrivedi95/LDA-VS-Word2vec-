Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas! My first time eating here was in 1991! Yes!  Back than it was a small little place with just a few tables, and now it is a Yelp Favorite!

The ambiance is so beautiful with a good energy. The staff is welcoming and respectful.

I ordered a Chile releno and a chorizo soft taco. My sister had the chicken fajita burrito. Both entrees were amazing as usual! Chips, salsa and bean dip, THE BEST!

Our waiter was very attentive and we were extremely happy with our dining experience.

Thank you Lindo for always providing excellent food and customer service! There is a reason why you are such a Las Vegas Favorite for all these years..
