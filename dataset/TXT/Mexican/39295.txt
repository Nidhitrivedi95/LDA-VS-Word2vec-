6C_8Mh4lmLc_QEs3hHleBg Ate here after a few days hiking in the Grand Canyon. We were staying in a fleabag motel near enough to the airport, and decided the Denney's in the parking lot wasn't worth the sceptic risk or the moral ambiguity.

As for El Pollo Supremo---the pollo was indeed supremo. The frijoles were also top notch. Never had this kind of salsa---looked more like applesauce. But it tasted good too as did the scorching hot corn tortillas. We cleaned our plates. 

The only complaint, aside from the boxed horchata, was the definition of 1/4 chicken. One of the "two" pieces was like the wing of some poor songbird. But it was toothsome all the same. And I really don't need to eat a 1/4 chicken to meet my basic nutritional needs now do I?
