aP2Ma-Wx2lydppntCGhNSg We really enjoyed dinner here the other night. I got the Pollo Fundido which is a fried chimi stuffed with chicken and covered in cream cheese and cheedar. Seriously....how could that not be good?

My only complaint is the salsa is a little thin. I  like a chunkier salsa, but that is hardly anything that would stop me from going back.

We had no waiting and a quiet dining experience. Two thumbs up!
