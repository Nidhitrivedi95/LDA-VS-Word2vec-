CZhc8YXdFLhAI4ViC2ERTg Put in an order for pickup this evening.  Have to say I'm not impressed.  When the best thing is the fideo soup you get for free with everything it's not a good sign.  Firstly when we got home we discovered part of the order was wrong.  We did not return it because we were hungry and didn't want to drive back down there.
The salsa they give you with the chips is sweet,  I saw one person on here describe it as tasting like spaghetti sauce and I would have to agree.  No flavor of onions, cilantro or Chile only sweet tomatoes kinda sad.
The green Chile pork burrito I had was very light on the meat and was nothing but a few pieces of fairly bland pork with on ok green tomatillo sauce.
Overall, very underwhelming.  Not sure I'd go back based on this.
