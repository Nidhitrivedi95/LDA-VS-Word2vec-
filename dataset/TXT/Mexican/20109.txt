1ZJz840L496LAmQdeDv0WA My first visit over a year ago was great. Tacos & corn were tasty. Just went there this last Sunday & I was disappointed. The pico de gallo salsa I got with my meal tasted old & sour, only took 1 bite. My $10 carne asada burrito had mostly beans & rice. The avocado slices in it were brown & stringy. The prices are higher than a regular taco shop - understandable given the location. However, they need to step it up & make it worth it if they want locals to keep going. I was not happy when I saw the way the fridge was organized: marinating meat in bags on a shelf above salsa containers. About 3 tables inside only so it's a small place with mostly outdoor seating. Service was so so. No smiling or happiness. Just there.
