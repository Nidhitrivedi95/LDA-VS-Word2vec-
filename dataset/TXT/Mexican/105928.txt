fjvu3PkvrTOoIjNqL1vrJQ After a week in Arizona and thinking it was just a way of life to have slow greeters at the door, and even slower service, Spotted Donkey changed my way of thinking.

We went in the late afternoon on a Saturday.  The place was pretty quiet.  We were seated quickly, and our drink order was promptly taken.  They have happy hour specials even on Saturday.  We had the salsa appetizer.  The pineapple habenero will knock you over, but is very good.  All salsas were very fresh, and they will refill the basket if you ask.  I had fish tostados.  For the amount of flavor and number you get, it can't be beaten.  My fiancee had the chimichunga.  It was presented cut in half, with some sauce on the plate.  Very appealing, and very tasty.  

The bathrooms were nice, and there is ample parking.  The few other tables in the restaurant all seemed happy.  Nice to finally get good service, great food, and a great atmosphere.  

Highly recommend this place, and make sure you put it in your GPS, as there is another Hayden Rd, and you could end up on that one first.
