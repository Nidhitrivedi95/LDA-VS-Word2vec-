BToSTEiaK94G3h5_XROEcA I love this authentic Mexican restaurant. I'm giving it four stars because they're quite picky when it comes to giving you certain things I usually get my mean with chips and  salsa but you have to pay for it separately. Most restaurants give it to you on the house. But they're different here. But other than that it's a very clean family environment. I love the music that's played in the restaurant as well. Makes you feel like your in Mexico!
