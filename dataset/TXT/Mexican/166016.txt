lOQPeguczAueJnLmDUTfGg Excellent service, excellent service, excellent food.  The prices are a little high, but they don't nickel and dime you for more chips and salsa.  They also have fresh refried beans with those homemade chips..  Staff was very attentive and in point, this is the kind of place that will bag your to-go portions for you.. awesome. Overall this place was very nice and I highly recommend stopping by.
