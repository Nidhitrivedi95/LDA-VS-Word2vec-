_2Wbpm821bdNsh-gyqufrg The food is good the service not so good.. I've been here couple times and the service is always the same, to me is like people that work there don't want to work there.. we passed drive thru and ordered a family meal 8 piece to be exact. I asked for corn tortillas got flour tortillas, asked to only have leg and thigh, they put all kinds of chicken, i asked for the mando chili salad and she put the avocado salad.. after all we were so hungry and on a hurry that I just decided to call and let them know about my order.. the lady just said sorry and never even offered to come back and change what they had done wrong..
