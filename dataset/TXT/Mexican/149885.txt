jsuUmIEefPjV__ads62Z5w The closest authentic New Mexican chile in the Phoenix area. Instead of the standard green chili pork and red and green "sauce" that many Mexican restaurants serve here, Dick's has actually chile straight from NM. As others have said, this place is not the most visible establishment. It is on the side of strip mall facing 16th Street. The place does fill up quickly and is not very large. However, it is worth whatever small wait there might be. The portions are huge and service is fast.
