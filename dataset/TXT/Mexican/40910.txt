6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA I have nothing bad but nothing spectacular to say about Canyon Cafe. 

My meal started with chips and salsa, but not normal chips Tortola chips, sopapilla chips and tiny sweet potato chips... all covered with Chile spice. Seemed like a good idea but the portions aren't right and the chili space conflicts with the salsa (which was good) but did not create a synergy.

I had two tacos and made it a meal with beans and rice. The Bison taco was slightly over spiced and being that the ground bison was very light in texture it took in too much other characters and was hard to differentiate from other beef. my chili Relleno  taco had mushrooms and an overabundance of tomato paste making it almost like lasagna.

Overall I have to say it's like they are trying too hard and creating these fusion recipes that miss the mark. Although things were palatable, the concepts employed were okay, and the service was good I have to give it a 3. I did see many good dishes I wish I had tried instead so I'm not completely averse to trying those items, but the tacos were certainly lackluster.
