a5IOLO2APwxDAyNepO-WWQ Laurita's.... This place is GROSS!! Not even 5 min after I wanted to throw up. I do not believe for a second things are made fresh. Maybe days old food their serving. I don't know about anyone else but I would rather wait 10 minutes for three tacos if that meant great savory and fresh cooked meat. My boyfriend had a California Burrito and he literally threw up. Yup we don't have the stomach for this kind of food. I live Mexican, hey Im Mexican but this food is a no go.
