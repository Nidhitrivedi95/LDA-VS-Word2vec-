nYIBVvjArSutlz2rkL8m-w Qdoba what happened!!!! You guys came to Cleveland After success in Mentor and did a great job. The food and customer service was fantastic when you first opened. Now you get sub par meat that has been held in a hot unit for who knows how long. Not that clean anymore. No more foot traffic and you have closed locations in the area. Please rethink your community presence because you have a great product going for you or shall I say had. I know I know I may be harsh but someone needs to wake up the owner and get this place thriving, yeah Chipotle has a strong following in EVERY community it touches but think about the other half they are not touching. People with tolerance to spices, Families, elderly that want to sit and watch that hanging tv of yours. Get it right or move along....
