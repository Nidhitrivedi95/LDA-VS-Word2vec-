aDWOXQVSvRPOpqcJ1ja0_Q Walked into this placed based completely on the other Yelp reviews and it's confirmed, this place is a gem! I tried out the butter chicken roll and was quite satisfied...cheap and tasty!

As a word of caution though, the butter chicken roll does not contain any solid pieces of chicken...its some kind of paste and sauce together...I know this doesn't sound appetizing, but it's quite good!
