lOQPeguczAueJnLmDUTfGg Proud to make this my first ever Yelp review. This place is one of the few restaurants I've ever been to that give you a full on "experience" from beginning to end. A group of friends and I in our travels dropped in due to a free margarita promotion and the party started with our awesome waiter, Richard. Then I - a black guy - took on the Gringo challenge (not spoiling it, go and take it on yourself) and got another free drink! The food was top notch and pardon the misogyny but the ladies are gorgeous too, please respect them as they want to make sure your time there is optimal with pictures and drinks as well. I'd type more but the tequila is working  go here!!!
