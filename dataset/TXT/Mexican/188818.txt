OA5Li3ySzhrbG_WvD_QGYA I'm a fan of this place!  We came in around 8pm on a wednesday night, and the place was busy, but not overly crowded.  There wasn't a seat outside on the patio (bummer), but we were able to sit right away in the dining room.  The food was all fantastic.  I loved that I could make any taco I could dream up, but that there was also a list of excellent pre-made combinations to choose from.

I thought the Margarita's were a touch sweet, but that's probably just personal preference!  An excellent choice for solid Taco's and Margaritas.
