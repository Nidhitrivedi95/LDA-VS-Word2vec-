4aFAN5aS0Y873KNhBlkAvQ Who would have ever thought to try Mexican food in Scotland? Me, that's who!
Very nice place and location with plenty of parking. The menu seemed endless and yet some of the things were odd to us. Not sure where they derived their version of Mexican food from but whatever, might as well try it. Popcorn as a starter instead of chips and salsa? Um, ok. Never seen that before. I tried the fajitas and they were served and tasted like every other Mexican place I've eaten. Family had the loaded nachos and complained about the soggy chips within. Someone needs to remember to NOT pour runny salsa over tortilla chips if serving as "nachos". Other than that, the pricing was fair and comparable to other places. Not my favorite but I'd probably go back.
Our server, Eden, was awesome and had a thick Scottish accent. Very nice and affable but I literally had to ask her to slow down when speaking because of the loud atmosphere in the restaurant. She took my joking about her accent in stride and we had a good laugh about the stupid American who gave her a blank stare when she spoke.
I recommend this place, if you can't find better elsewhere.
