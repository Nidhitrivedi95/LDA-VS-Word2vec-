-_O0VCqTfHWwweJsj7khNg Worst chipotle EVER! They are either stingy or barely on the money. The line is constantly out the door because they are SLOW!! If you ask for something extra or if they mess up, they give you an attitude. 
And calling the order in is WORSE!! It takes less time to just show up then place the order and go there and wait for it some more. Terrible! Never again.
