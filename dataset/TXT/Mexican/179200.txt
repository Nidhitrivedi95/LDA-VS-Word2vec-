MZRqxvBkJLjKcoOjNz7yLA I read the reviews and because I was craving Mexican food I decided to give it a try anyways. Mistake number one. The outdoor seating has a fun atmosphere, Music playing & misters we're on to keep cool. So that was nice but the food service and quality failed miserably. Guacomole was okay but not for the price. I ordered the chicken flautas. They basically throw them in a fryer (for way to long) so the ends are fried to a crisp and when I finally got past the over crispy  part.... I hit the dried out rough chicken part. They serve you three but I only ate one and half before I realized it wasn't gonna taste any better. The rice wasn't so bad. It was tasteful and fluffy but the canned beans have got to go. Gross!! It was obvious our server didn't want to be there anymore than I did after tasting the food. I figure we tried it and now we know better. We won't be returning to this place again.
