pEH8XwiyGOe1t7GlboAgGw Came here for dinner on a Tuesday in June. I ordered the chicken empanadas to start and the Chipotle Arrachera con Frijoles.  Both were pretty tasty and I would recommend them.  The steak dish is a little heavy for a warm summer evening and I found myself wishing it came with a fresh tomato salsa.  My companion ordered the fish of the day, it was okay, but neither or us were wild about the flavour profile.  For desert I ordered the selection of 3 ice creams, choosing soursop, dulce de leche, and spicy chocolate.  My companion ordered the selection of selection of biscuits which were incredible lovely to look at but she had no room for and ended up taking most to go.  We both thought that the ice creams had nice flavours but were overly sweet.  The few cookies we tried were also a little too sweet.

The thing that I was most put off by during our experience was a how the smoky the seating area was from things being burned in the kitchen.  The open kitchen is supposed to be a design feature that creates interest but I found it meant a less pleasant dining experience.  

 The was service good and friendly.  The food was pretty good but not so outstanding that I would feel the need to come back.
