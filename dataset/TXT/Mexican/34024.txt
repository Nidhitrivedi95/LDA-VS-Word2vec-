We know this place from its original location in Albuquerque, NM, so we were quite excited to see they have a location in Vegas as well. The service was average, but the food was exceptional. They also have a salsa bar with a large variety of salsas to try. The restaurant is located in the Fiesta casino, which is more of a locals hang out, we saw few tourists there. It is well off the strip, so not convenient to get to, but it only cost us $15 to take an Uber there from the strip. It was well worth the trip!
