T-KniGykrZ46ZC9plOTspw First try here I had the shrimp burrito. Was full of cabbage, a bit dry and not too flavorful. 

2nd attempt was the Carne Asada Burrito. Much better! I had mine with pinto beans, guac and sour cream. It was a bit too 'soupy' in texture for me. Next time I'll try without the beans..

Tortillas are delish. Service is friendly.
