eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw After flying down Fremont St. on Slotzilla zipline we needed to eat! Nacho Daddy was a short walk back from the end of Fremont and could seat 8 of us right away. We started with the Mexican street corn, which I've had in Mexico, and it was pretty good but not the same as in Mexico. I had the pork tamale and seafood enchilada combo. I was really happy with both of my dishes. Our friends split the filet fajitas and they really liked them too. They have scorpion shots for those who are brave enough lol. Our waiter was great too, fast service and checked on us appropriately. All in all a great dining experience here.
