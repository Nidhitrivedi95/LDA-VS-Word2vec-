vnKHXrw585IOH4F3m29yFQ Having been to Milagro multiple times, I have noticed the increase in prices and decrease in portion size. I work in the restaurant industry, and when I see an establishment getting greedy, it really bugs me. Flavour-wise though, the food is delicious.

Otherwise, the experience is ok, and the service is GREAT! The music, I was blown away by a couple times- turns out it was an employee's playlist. Really great music.
