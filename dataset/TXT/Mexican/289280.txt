YkOCo5ipV2he2WXIAlZb-A I've been seeing these sushi burritos all over my Yelp feed from various people in California, Las Vegas, and Hawaii.  What's the hype?  It's just a giant sushi roll, right?  Oh. Mah. Gawd. Can we open a Jaburritos in Arizona because wow cow!

We ordered a Rockport ($10.95 - Soft shell crab, spicy tuna, imitation crab, jalapeño, masago, cucumbers, red onions, tempura crunch, with chipotle mayo and eel sauce on soy paper) and a Mission ($8.95 - Salmon, ebi shrimp, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tortilla strips, romaine lettuce, with yuzu avocado cilantro on soy paper) to share. Both were made as combos, one with seaweed salad and one with taro chips that also comes with a side of queso cheese. It could be because we had just got off the plane but everything we had was quite tasty. I ended up swapping half my Mission for half a Rockport and by the time I finished my half of the Mission, I was too full to eat the Rockport. After a few bites of the Rockport, I gave it back and later regretted it because it was damn good. I like how both burritos had a crunchy element for texture. Yum! Those taro chips are also amazing and sweet. They didn't even need the queso.

Service here is great, the place was clean, and parking was plentiful. I want to go back like right now!
