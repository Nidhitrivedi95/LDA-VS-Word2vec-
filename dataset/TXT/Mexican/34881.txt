5-fpVbhoZcuSWatzof5YIg I consistently eat at Rubios on lake mead and tenaya and the service is outstanding as well as the food . This Rubios was extremely slow . It took twenty minutes to get our food and there were only two other customers . The manager was handling food with no gloves and I saw her eating food that was left over after she made it . I will never go to this Rubios again . Very disappointed !
