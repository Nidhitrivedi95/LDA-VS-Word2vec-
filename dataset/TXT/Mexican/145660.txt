jIzygnVmajEXYmfsBNY_Gw I hope there is a good business reason to close at DINNER TIME everyday (7pm). 5 stars for the food , 1 Star for convenience. Great food and great choices. But my advice is "availability is the best ability". I would go 3 times per week if they stayed open later so I could eat dinner there after work.
