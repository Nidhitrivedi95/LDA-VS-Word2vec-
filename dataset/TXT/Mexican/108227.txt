frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A Horrible service.  We walked in to place a to-go order and were not even acknowledged.  Then we stood there for at least 5 minutes and waited. No menu to even look at so we asked someone if we could see a menu and the man rudely told us to give him a second.  Clearly they don't need our business, so we walked out and will be taking our business elsewhere.  Also, it's pretty disgusting how you can look straight into the bathroom and see the toilet from the bar and tables.  Gross.
