KMxOoHyRKP74PgosuRkkdg Great place for Street Tacos! You definitely will be full once you leave this place. The workers are very kind when you have questions to ask. The only problem I have is the seat placing. There isn't enough seats in the restaurant so sometimes you're forced to eat outside or take it home. The tacos are worth it though! Great place to eat! Will come again!
