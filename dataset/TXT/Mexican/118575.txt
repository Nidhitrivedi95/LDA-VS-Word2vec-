Gr-2oBg4XyduSKbvnE-i9g Great location to go catch a quick game. They have great screens. Seating area is small.  They have a small patio. It can be a bit chili to seat outside right now. Sometimes the bar area is completely full. Parking can be a bit of an issue at this location. Arrive early or park in the back or to the side. I like the grilled chicken and carne asada tacos. They have the right combination of ingredients and taste. They have quite a variety of tacos. They do have a happy hour menu with the tacos. I like to order the regular size tacos as the HH ones tend to be small. Great chips and salsa. Enjoy.
