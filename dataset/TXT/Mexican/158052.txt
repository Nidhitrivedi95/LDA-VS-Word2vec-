knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw For a downtown Mexican restaurant you expect nothing but the best especially when you are across from Lola's. Okay food, great atmosphere and service is so so..but So much more potential for Zocalo if the owner cared a bit more for the quality of the food and service...I mean if your neighborhood Mexican restaurant has better quality food then why bother driving 30 minutes downtown to eat here.?!
