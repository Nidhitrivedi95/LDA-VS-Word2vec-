GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog I hate giving negative reviews but this place is just so bad.... with all the great places to eat in LV, you should skip this one. The food is not good at all, we had about 4 or 5 small things on the menu- some sort of dumplings, fries covered in toppings etc. The fries were the worst thing I eat in our 10 day trip. Also, the service was horrendous. 

I did however, get an excellent margarita
