Ia_4DtMhp92IcFt0bzZhIg Absolutely terrible for a burrito place. Nor up to par with competitors. Burrito was very small, little toppings, and minute made rice. The side chips were very bland and no flavour. The salsa was watered down, and then drink was too small. Overall a complete waste of $11. I do not recommend this place.
