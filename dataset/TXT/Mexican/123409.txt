hk7BUC8zi7xXPo2GGU4v7w Looks like it's back to the drawing boards with Submission. We had been asked last minute by Hookah Palace to run our weekly promotion giving us two days to prepare for the first week. Needless to say it was a flop. Then week two was a little better, yet we did not bring down the house. Any good promoter will tell you that it is almost impossible to pack a place the size of a football field, that does not already have clientele in the first week and a half of promotion. We need to be cleaver and run several promotions and develop a crowd. Yet Hookah Palace was disappointed that we did not create a miracle. Hookah Palace decided to let us know when we accidentally called them that we would no longer be welcome there. This was on Tuesday, two days prior to the event, flyers were printed, invites were sent out, extra promoters were hires. We were also getting ready to set up our DJ battle which we discussed with Hookah Palace would run for five weeks. I guess we were lucky in that we did not start that up as soon as we would hope. In the end we are disappointed with Hookah Palace and the way they operate. Don't cancel on someone two days prior to an event. Last time House of DON Productions will operate under a gentleman's agreement, that is for sure. Thank you for listening.
