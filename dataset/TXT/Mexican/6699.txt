_H4GXECi4nHfJTz4dsQV_w These were the best burritos I have had in a very long time. The meat was amazing. I had one that was a braised pork and one that was a red chile meat of some type. I am sorry I don't remember but my mind went numb after eating this little piece of heaven. I almost rated a 4 star because the burritos are a little small but then remembered that they are only about $4 and at that price I got two. You won't be disappointed.
