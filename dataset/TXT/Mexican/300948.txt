I've been there numerous times as I work close-by so I've gotten to play around with the combinations to know what works best because piling it all on doesn't necessarily taste best. If you choose ALL possible toppings, it ends up being too acidic and gives me heartburn. Also, their burritos are so large that I usually either eat 1/2 for lunch, 1/2 for dinner or I order a salad bowl. It's basically a bed of lettuce topped with everything that would go into a burrito and it keeps better than a burrito which ends up a little soggy. All in all, my fave go-to order is the ancho beef burrito or salad bowl - I prefer it to the smoked chicken. You'll definitely be seeing me again soon!
