ERM603jbIbNqX2c7Ww1Qiw Food is great, however this location is newly opened and seems to have some kinks to work out in the line.  My family and I come here each Tuesday after swim and it doesn't seem to matter how many customers are in line, it takes a while to get through.  What's frustrating is seeing your hot food just sit there.  Hopefully this gets figured out.
