d_L-rfS1vT3JMzgCUGtiow It was a Saturday night but still....

Found the food flavorful and creative in the favors and combinations but the plating gave us the impression we were at a budget banquet event. 

Our " Special guacamole with bacon" was plopped on the plate in which it was served like it came out of a serving spoon from a vat....$11.00 please!  My roasted pork was served on a banana leaf for decoration but again...plopped on the leaf with little care or accompaniments. Tortillas were good but cost extra with the pork I ordered. 

You may like the taste of what's served here but the price and lack of care in plating for the prices charged didn't add up to good value to me.

Our server's section on the patio was over-seated and for a $150 dinner for two we expected a better commitment to service staffing. We saw no management cruise the patio for oversight. A swamped server that got little support. You know the picture. 

Flavorful food but the overall dining experience left us feeling like tourist who got what they deserved for going here on a Saturday night. 

Plop!
