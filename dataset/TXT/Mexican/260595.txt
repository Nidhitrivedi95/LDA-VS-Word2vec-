VRTrhsYKSJo1kGX5RqBlFA Went here around Labor Day for dinner.  It's definitely not a pleasant atmosphere for dinner.  It's incredibly bright and the tables are packed together and full of college students in badgers gear.   The chips and salsa were good, the queso was really boring-wouldn't order it again. The server described it as "like Qdoba, but better."  As for the food, the prices were good since it was taco Tuesday, but the tacos were very mediocre. Worst of all, I ordered a portobello mushroom taco and it came out with korean beef (and queso, so clearly someone in the kitchen thought it was the mushroom and prepared it that way) instead of mushroom.  The server didn't notice, and I didn't notice until I looked closely. I'm glad I am not a vegetarian, because this is a huge kitchen mistake. The server said she would bring me a new one, and comp the taco. She did bring me a new one, but ended up charging me for the wrong taco as well as the replacement. It took several discussions with her for her to understand how the bill should have been. Overall, the tacos were disappointing and the ambiance was definitely not a place for adults/families.  Definitely more of a hot spot for college kids.
