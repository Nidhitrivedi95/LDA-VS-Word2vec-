AhQu7mLtmGlp8U2I-SV_jA El Guero gets a "C-".  


What I ordered:  Burrito Bowl, brown rice, black beans, corn, hot salsa, lettuce, guacamole, fresh sliced peppers 

Lets talk about  the bad--

Black Beans-- unseasoned, tasted like they opened a can and microwaved them

Corn- blech! again can opener working over time, they could have at least rinsed it off or squeezed a lemon or lime to give it some zest!

If you like hot salsa, I repeat if you like HOT SALSA... run, run  far away from this place.  It was the worst excuse for salsa I have ever tasted!  It was like a can of tomato paste was aborted in to a spice rack.  Not everything needs to be gourmet, but at least  try!  (it was like "kissin' yer sister" ) I ended up scraping it off, or like they do in that Lonely Island song "I throw it on the ground!"

Also I got take out and wasn't even offered a plastic fork.  

The Good- and this is what gives me hope for their future

the brown rice was cooked perfectly, great texture, not mushy or undercooked.  

The peppers were fresh & crisp same for the lettuce, it was refreshing   

the Guacamole was good, I won't say it's best I've ever had, it is definitely a shining point that will have me coming back.  (plus i need to try their corn chips) 

The place had a good vibe everyone was friendly, it sure beat going to the Steelyard Chipotle, that place is maddening!  

I am sure in the coming months El Guero will see it's fare share of improvements as it matures, but until then I'll trek the extra mile to Ohio City Burrito for my lunch time taco fix.
