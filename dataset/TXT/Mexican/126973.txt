hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg i was here last year. it was fanastic.

this year was a little bit of a disappointment. i finally got around to order the lobster poutine. that was such a let down. there was only specks of lobster (so small i couldn't even tell it was lobster). the gravy was a bit fishy and there was hardly and curds. what topped it all off was that the poutine portion was very very small. i don't mind small portions but i would of been nice if i got a chunk of lobster. it wasn't worth $17.

i got the braised short rib for my main. that was great.

dessert i got the banana concauction. delish!

i would give this place a 3 1/2 stars.

service is wonderful!!
