rfmXVYoFnxRUPvOqPMkiLg I was in town from Colorado visiting family. I make it a point to try a different Mexican restaurant every time I'm here. This place is one of the best! I got the shrimp burrito and it was incredible! My son got the California burrito and loved it. This thing was gigantic and he ate almost all of it, keep in mind we're talking about a seven-year-old. The staff were very nice and the price is very reasonable.
