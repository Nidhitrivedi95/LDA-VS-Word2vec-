OzcvQqt_copeLRCT2OHrfA Now, let me start by saying that Felipito's only seems to cross my mind after having had a few cold ones, but whenever it does, it seems like the greatest idea anyone has ever had. Felipito's is about as simple as it gets, from the concrete picnic tables to the menu comprised mostly of blown-up pictures and numbers. But make no mistake: Felipito's is a hidden gem. From the carne asada plate to the chile rellenos, your drunk ass will actually take a moment from scarfing down the ridiculously large servings to slur, "This is realllllllyy gooood!" Which, despite your lowered inhibitions and altered judgment, is true. They've got fantastic homemade pico de gallo (which I recommend ordering an extra side of), as well as handmade (and freshly fried) flour tortillas. I'm kind of disappointed by the guacamole, which is clearly not made in-house, errr... in-shack, and it's safe to say the carnitas plate will blow your calorie intake goals for an entire week. But after a few cold beers, who cares, right? 

Ladies, I would recommend ordering from the drive-thru late at night. Dealing with sketchy characters or drunk dude-bros when you're trying to get your grub on can definitely detract from these greasy delicacies.

P.S. I can personally vouch that the Super Fries will prevent any trace of a hangover. For about six bucks you get a foam container with fries smothered in cheese, guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream, and steak. There is some kind of genius working in this broken down taco stand, I am quite certain.
