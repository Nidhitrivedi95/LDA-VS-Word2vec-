eqRYda9F_4ziinRW-N6ixw Had to get down and have my order corrected after sitting a decade in the drive thru. Shrimp cocktail was in a small cup. All other locations use the large cup. I told them this. I go home to find the tiniest shrimp on the planet in my cup. No bigger then a freakin dime. What a rip off!!! 10 dollars for bullshit!
