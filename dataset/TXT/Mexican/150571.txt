Came here twice this last year.  Location is nice.  

1st time: Food/Service for the food.....Not really that great.  I tried to eat here and left because the service was lacking.  Waters were not filled.  Food came cold and without condiments we needed like salsa and when we asked for it, the server forgot about us. 

2nd Time: They earned an extra star because of Groupon. They had a special for $15 for $30 worth of food or drinks. The best part was that for some reason Groupon only charged $1! I was like What??? I don't care how bad, the place was before...Dollar for drinks? I'm in. I purchased 2!  

Apparently it was some mistake, but Groupon honored it and I came armed with $30 to spend.  Went straight to the bar and got two $14 shots of tequila that came in a Worm shaped  bottle.

Smooooooooth. So if you come armed with the Groupon or not get the Tequila in the Worm Bottle. You will not regret it. Skip the food.  Hagar earned the extra star for the Worm Bottle Tequila Basically and the nice bartender.  Didn't have time to use the other Groupon on that trip...but Worm Tequila...I'm coming back for you!!!
