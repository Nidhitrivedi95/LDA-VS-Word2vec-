pYqP8GnTG8oxj4G2cxx7xQ Unlike other reviews I had a rather pleasant experience at Qdoba's.  It was my first time there and I loved the food.  I am not a fan of spicy food and that has to be the reason I prefer this place over chipotle.  

The steak tacos were fairly high quality as far as taste goes for $6 tacos.  There 3 cheese sauce was a little spicy but a new taste for me that I thoroughly enjoyed.
