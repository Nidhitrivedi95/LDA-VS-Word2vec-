ydqbNz2sHENV9XOElwyAYA So delicious! Our server, Austin was top notch. We were able to be seated right away at 7pm on a Saturday night. The salsa is so flavorful. We ordered the stacked enchiladas and the beef chimichanga. Both were delicious. Very fresh and flavorful. The chimichanga might be the best I have ever had! I loved that each dish had layers of flavor that all worked well together. If I am in the area visiting again this will be on the list of places to come again!
