2Wl4o7l54I-EtxtaDpOTzA A new brewpub at Tuscany sounds like an ingenious marketing move!
I attended a grand opening event 10 days after they opened to sample and sip the offerings at this new Pub! The decor is nice, it's typical brewpub atmosphere with a rustic touch, and they also have gaming at the bar. The main bar area is pretty big and there's a second room that could be used for private events. 

Though beer is the star of the show, I enjoyed their take on a Manhattan tremendously! It was prepared spot on and they even use fancy dark cherries for garnish. I also sampled a Joseph James brew, and this was very refreshing during the 110 evening. We had the chance to try different menu items such as nachos, sliders and mini doughnuts. The sliders were awesome and I would go back for more. The doughnuts could be topped with different sauces- a nice touch! Parking here is easy breezy- I was able to park right near the front of the casino in surface parking and walk right in.
