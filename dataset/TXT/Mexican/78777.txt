cr84hpeFeas6N6VGV7Iu3A Yay I'm a fan! I just moved here and it's definitely been a little tough to find some good mexican food. This place is the best I've had so far, but there is room for improvement- mainly just the authenticity factor. 

The food itself is good quality, fresh, and well portioned. I was in a party of 3, and we each had a drink (mojito, sangria, and marg- gotta taste the whole menu right?)- the sangria was my fave-- great flavor, robust taste. My second fave was my mojito- but there may have been a tad too much sugar in it and it could have been mulled a bit more. Still, good drinks.

Had the 3-A nachos. They were a good portion with shredded chicken, but honestly, they lacked flavor and salsa. The top was a bunch of iceberg lettuce with sour cream. I asked for black beans instead of refried beans which are supposed to come in the nachos. They were fine, but the table next to us got the guac in a LARGE dish...so I would opt for that next time!!

I had three tacos for the $2 taco Tuesday special...and eh, they were fine, but they didnt come with any spice and there was none at the table. I asked the waitress for some medium salsa and she brought out a creamy green sauce that was honestly not that great.

My two dining partners were SUPER satisfied with their dishes though, and I would definitely opt for those next time.  Chicken fajitas was one of them, and the other was carne asada. Carne asada came sliced with tortillas (choice of corn or flour) so really, it was almost like fajijtas.

We finished with an order of churros. I think there were 5-6 churros in the order, and they were churros rellenos (with the cream inside)..SO GOOD! I wish they came with chocolate sauce, but they actually came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream that we dipped them in- very good!! 

Next time, I'll stick with fajitas and a sangria or beer ($2 beers on Tuesdays!) and ask for extra salsa for my meal- and all will be great!!
