s4Q0Med8QVVXSrhoAYq-kw I wanted to try Taco Bar because of the good reviews on yelp and also because it's close to my place but it was honestly disappointing. I ordered delivery and got de pescado taco , de cochinita pibil taco, and the de arrachera taco with guacamole. The guacamole comes with tortilla chips so I ordered and extra side of chips for nothing. Some of the chips were very salty. The de pescado taco is marinated fish with coleslaw. There was way too much coleslaw in the taco and it was overpowering the fish. De coconuts and pibil was my favorite  out of the three tacos I ordered. It's marinated pork with red onion and habanero peppers. It tasted like a pulled pork taco very flavorful and not spicy as indicate son the menu. De arrachera is bavette marinated with spices and grilled which made the meat kind of chewy. I would not recommend this place. Check out Escondite in downtown Montreal instead!
