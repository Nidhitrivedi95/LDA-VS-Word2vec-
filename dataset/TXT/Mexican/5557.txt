_5wi2C7x68Bt14qhdCqi1Q This Roberto's has the Same Menu Items as the Rest of them in the Las Vegas Valley! Same Furnishings as The Others as well! I had No Problems with My Order...They were Pretty Quick with My Order. 

They do have a lot of Parking, as they are sharing with other Businesses in that little Strip Mall! They are Open 24 Hours, and I think this location is a Fairly New One!

Just be Wary of some of the Drivers in the area, at times they don't look when they are Backing out of the Parking Stall, or Keep on Driving when they were Suppose to Stop at the Stop Sign!
