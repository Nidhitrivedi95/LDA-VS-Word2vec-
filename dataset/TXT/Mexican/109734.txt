fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg I can't help but see all these bad reviews and realize that most of them are irritated people, and everyone has bad days, but you can't take it out on the restaraunt. I came here on August 21st, and even tho it was busy, the food was honestly amazing. Maybe not 100% authentic, but 100% tasty. Definitely worth a shot. I ordered the pork burrito and the trash can nachos along with an awesome Cadillac margarita. Don't trust all the reviews. This place was off the chain in the taste scale. Whoo!!
