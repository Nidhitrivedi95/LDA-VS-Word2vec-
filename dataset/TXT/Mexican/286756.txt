You see, this particular spot previously housed a little place known as Gallo Blanco. The flavor of their tacos, particularly their carne asada, is forever burned in my memory. As a result, I have to remind myself to not compare these people to a place that no longer exists, at least not for the time being. It's simply just not fair.

With that out of the way, Café Tranquilo is a neat little hotel-based establishment that focuses on Latin-American cuisine. We stopped by one late afternoon to try some of their offerings. The place was empty for some odd reason - which was in stark contrast to the last time I was in this same dining room three years prior.

Their chips and salsa were excellent quality, with three variations being provided. Additionally, we ordered some tacos, including pollo, asada, pork, and fish. All were fine for what they were, although still not eh . . . never mind. Beans and rice were also all right.

Honestly, I don't know. Taco standards have significantly gone up in recent years to the point where I feel like I might have to return here and dive a little deeper into their menu to find out what they're all about. 

It won't "wow" you - but it won't really make you wince either.

Give them a try at least - as I do feel they at least deserve a fair chance.
