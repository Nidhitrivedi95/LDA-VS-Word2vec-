NuExoRpRNRsVgRyF_E5Zhw This Chandler and Alma School location never fails to surprise. I like Filiberto's but this place seems a bit pricier than some of the others and they ALWAYS skimp on portions. You never know what you're gonna get as far as freshness and flavor goes. I have gone to the Elliot and Dobson one, many a times, just to avoid this Filiberto's and I live in walking distance! I always tell myself never to come back but I must say I am guilty But only after a late night of working and don't feel like driving far and getting out of my car. I really shouldn't be surprised...

***Da Bafroom: I have only been inside this location once, a long time ago, and did not visit the bathroom. Shame on me, yes I know! But being that it's one of the newest Fili-B's, I would imagine it being a fairly clean and ordinary bathroom. May need to make one more stop someday to update this portion of my review. To be continued...
