1Vvxx-9AoINg8TJXOZgEHg Honestly, I can't even complain. We came here twice while staying at Planet Hollywood and it was great both times. We started the trip off with one of the best cocktails I have ever had, "The Patron Sidecar." So good. I ordered the Chicken Torta to get some food in me before our night out, and it was so tasty. I saved the rest for later to eat after we got back from a night of dancing, and still good. We then came back to have lunch on Sunday before our flight. We needed something to bring us back to life if you know what I mean. We ordered the nachos, and taquitos. They got the job DONE. Perfect little spot to have in Vegas. I will be back!!!
