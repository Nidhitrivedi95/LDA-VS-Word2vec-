DMwU0igEs9K7XuI3utsr6g Upon walking in here I could smell old alcohol that seemed that it hasn't been cleaned up from the floor for weeks. This was a real turn off.  I mean the place kinda stank. I was in a rush to catch a plane, so I decided to stick it out and give it a chance. I ordered the Mexican Skirt steak. The flavor of the steak was surprisingly pretty tasty and it was tender. The rice and beans with which it came with was just OK. 

The tortillas however were pretty awful, and resembled something more like cardboard.  

Given that this place is in an airport, I would say that it wasn't that bad.
