JDhptB4mdm8ktmyB74NnXw I love this little "hole in the wall" west valley gem.  Never had a bad meal and try to pay a weekly visit.  Staff are always pleasant and quick to make your order hot and fresh.  Can't go wrong with the selection of cheese steaks, my favorite is the Boardwalk.  If you're lucky they will have a rack of ribs on the grill out front to fill your nostrils with a heavenly aroma and get your mouth salivating as you say to yourself...I've got to comeback and try those.
