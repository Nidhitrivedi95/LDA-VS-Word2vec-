9w18Hgg_UmI18YyVTP_E3Q I've heard mixed reviews of Fuzzy's, so I was hesitant to try it at first, but I eventually gave it a shot. The reviews were wrong. Fuzzy's does a solid taco. They might not be haute cuisine, but they're made with fresh ingredients, on the spot. At first I thought it was a little strange that they put feta cheese on the tacos, but it turned out to be an awesome addition. The sauce that comes with the tacos is decent, somewhat garlicy, and flavorful. The chips and queso are pretty decent, though the queso is somewhat on the mild side. 


Fuzzy's isn't fancy, but it doesn't need to be. The food is good, and that's what matters. I recommend giving it a shot.
