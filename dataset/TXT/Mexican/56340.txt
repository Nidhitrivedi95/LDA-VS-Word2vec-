a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg I believe I've came here about 5 times now, and I really never had a disappointing experience. My most recent experience I came here during lunch and surprisingly it wasn't too busy. They always start you off with fresh tortilla chips and the bean and salsa dip. We didn't have the guacamole this time, but I have tried it and boy is it delicious. I've never tried Huevos Rancheros before so I decided to give it a go. I was overall pleased with how it tasted. Eggs made over medium correctly and the rice and beans were super tasty. I've also tried their fajitas which were awesome, the meat was cooked perfectly and I loved the 'grilled' veggies that come on the hot platter.

They do make their tortillas fresh there, usually when I come in I see the lady making them. The place usually gets really warm and I can slightly feel the cool breeze blowing, but not enough to bother me. The service was 'OK' she came by a few times and checked on us, but took a while to grab our check. I do enjoy the food and the atmosphere. Location is very close to my house so I don't see myself not coming here.
