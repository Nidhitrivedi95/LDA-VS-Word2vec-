826djy6K_9Fp0ptqJ2_Yag Chipotle never disappoints me. I am never left feeling hungry after eating here. Today I got a steak burrito bowl. Actually I'm still polishing it off right now (I'm a super slow eater). Anyways, when I got there around 1:30 PM, there was no line-up and my food was ready in 2 mins. The portions aren't massive but they give enough to satisfy me. The food always taste great and fresh, which is more important to me than portion size.  I learned this after eating dog food at Burrito Boyz... well it tasted like dog food, but I'll save that when I write that review.

I thought my bowl was a good size but then, a lady sat beside me and hers was bigger and looked a million times better. I looked back and they changed staff so I guess my guy just sucked or thought I needed to lose weight or thought I couldn't take a big bowl or whatever. It's fine, but I just wish they were more consistent. I'm still really enjoying my bowl even though my dentist froze half of my mouth. I probably would've enjoyed it more with a full mouth though. Next time!
