r8hF3kwnZzxTo1IYNcI6rg We were actually on our way to another restaurant, when we passed El Sombrero & my boyfriend said "oh we still need to try that place." So I made a u-turn & we checked it out. I LOVE the decor inside...very cute. The ambiance is great. I really appreciate when music matches the food in a restaurant. 
We started off with drinks. I got the margarita & he got the michelada. He enjoyed his michelada although he personally likes them spicier. I really liked my margarita. Too many Mexican restaurants try to get away with using syrup & generic margarita mix...not here! My margarita definitely did not have the thickness of the syrup I've had to endure at other Mexican restaurants nearby. I could taste the fresh lime juice. So on to the food...
The salsa was a little on the watery side, but had a great flavor. The guacamole was simple & refreshing. I was looking forward to the mangoes on the Fresca Mexicana salad; so I was a little disappointed when it came out with watermelon instead of mangoes. When I asked the server, he told me that the salad is with watermelon right now because mangoes aren't in season. Makes complete sense, I just would have liked to be informed of that when I ordered. Nonetheless, the cilantro lime dressing was amazing! It ended up being a great light & refreshing salad. My boyfriend loved the carne asada taco. The veggie tacos lacked flavor so I would not recommend those. On the other hand, the vegetarian chile relleno had a great flavor! My boyfriend and I both agreed that the veggie chile relleno was our favorite dish today. For dessert, we had the chocolate dulce de leche cake...yummy yummy!!! Overall, everything was great except for the veggie tacos. I will definitely be back to try more!
