ak-f8IV0ZdDeI4oYnjA1Pw This place is amazing. I drove past it many times and never got to stop in. I was told to check out Chili Addiction I walked in, looked at the menu and walked out and went right over to your restaurant. I wanted authentic Mexican food and I got it when I went to Habaneros Taco Grill. Amazing food, fast service, awesome prices. I'll be back again
