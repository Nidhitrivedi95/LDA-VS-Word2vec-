Za7NNCyOPnwem4xATpKSbg I like this location generally.  The staff is friendly.  Food is good.  Although the last time I had a coworker pickup my order of Chile roast beef salad,  and there was no salad in it wth. It was kinda like a  burrito bowl instead and I was charged for the salad bowl. My Co worker even ask if this was a salad since it did not look right. They confirmed that it was a salad.  So I don't know who made my salad last time. But salads have green leaves in it lol.
