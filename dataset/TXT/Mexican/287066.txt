ybFJUdRaN4eCff-W3HHiEw I heard so much about this place and when my friends informed me about the reservation they made on Saturday, i was excited. 

When you enter the place, you see that the concept is a garage, where the windows are actually the entrance. 
The tables are made of wood, and you feel like sitting in a wooden cabano.

I asked the waiter to tell me about their drinks speciality. He suggested the margarita. I did have a lot of margarita in my life, and this one was such a desapointment. 
It comes in a tiny glass with tones of icecubes. The taste was diluted.

For the food, we had the salmon dynamite, that I recommend.
We also had tasteless carnitas and steak tacos. The first one is shredded porc with avocado and the second is diced steak with mushroom and chimichurri. 

Finally for the desert we got a cake since it was the birthday of our friend. 
They charged each guest 2.5$ for the service !

I definitly dont recommend this place for mexican food, but if you are in the area you can try their salmon dynamite.
