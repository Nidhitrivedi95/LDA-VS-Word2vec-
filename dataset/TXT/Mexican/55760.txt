A_vo-3ZKB2hFmoARMxBoxw Decent food, good service, but prices are kind of high.  Four kinds of salsa:  Pico de Gallo (very mild), green tomatillo (tasty), and two types of red sauce.  I think their salsas taste too much like pre-made, and not fresh, although the Pico de Gallo looked like it was made fresh - but it didn't have too much flavor, and was not "hot" at all.  I would rate their guacamole as being one of their best items, along with their shredded chicken, shredded beef, and shredded pork.
