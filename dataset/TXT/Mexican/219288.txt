rD32POdIhGN9eR8aUxl-3A This has to be the shittest Chipotle I've ever been to!!!! I'm so irritated with their friggin' cashier. I'm in line ordering my food and the poor lady is standing there while the cashier is having a conversation with an another employee who is not on shift (uniform on/personal belongings on her) that was so unprofessional. At one point I turned because I swear I heard her say b**** to the other employee while the lady is still standing there! 

We're up to pay and she says, what did you guys order? My BF replies, that bowl and burrito(mind you, this is  my BF's like 3rd time eating here and I normally order) In her snarky a$$ attitude says, I see that. What is it? Excuse me? OMG. I literally had to breath.

Needless to say, I will never go back to that location. Chipotle, that girl needs to gooo!!
