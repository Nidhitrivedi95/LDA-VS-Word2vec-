1SL4o9YkOxfJMXIx2jic7w I went to rubies' 1st time and my order was made wrong customer in front of me was complaining they had been waiting 20 minutes to get there order finally asked for there money back . I never got a receipt or number and after get my food and having them have to remake it because it was wrong. I found out i was charged wrong 16 bucks for 3 taco's. she told me shrimp tocos are 4.99 each but that didn't seem right the menu said 8.49 for two al carte tacos no rice not beans no chips it was charged wrong and just wanted my 5 bucks back instead I was given back a dollar. It wasn't right i did the math on my phone and showed the cashier. I was over charged and instead of giving me my money back she gave me a card to eat free one time next time. I just wanted my 5 bucks but didn't get that bad 1st experience.
