Or7FgbgY8ML30zgYj_DCwA The food tasted ok, it just didn't taste "Mexican". We had the Enchiladas and QUesadillas....sorry but they didn't taste like Mexican food, not sure what it tasted like. I've had "real" Mexican food before and this is not it unless they'er cooking recipes from some obscure part of Mexico.
It's also VERY noisy. You can hardly have a conversation at dinner. A friend just told me she went and her comments about the food were the same. No, I wouldn't go back.
