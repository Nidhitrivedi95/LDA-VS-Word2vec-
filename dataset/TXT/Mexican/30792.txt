We ordered the nachos and three dips, and the scorpion wings for apps alongside some drinks. I also tried the Pollo Frito Taco & the Crispy Cotija which were exploding with flavour and very filling. Something else, which was not great, was that they served all the tacos in communal plates, which made it difficult for our group of 11 to distinguish who ordered what when the food came. 

The most frustrating thing we experienced other than the the extremely slow service, was the cake cutting fee they wanted to charge us for bringing a birthday cake. I can understand if we brought a bottle of wine from outside or another food item in competition with their menu items, but a birthday cake should not be subject to an "extra cake cutting fee"

Overall, this restaurant is more hype than anything. it's highly unlikely I will come back or recommend this restaurant to anyone else. 

Side note, they also do not split bills
