xLy3aWEbtpoUSVdjuHBS0A I have been here a couple times, some good, some bad. The guacamole is pretty good, and prepared to your liking, however it comes at a hefty price- 8 bucks plus a tip.

Other meals that my family/ friends have eaten looked pretty good, however I ordered the Fried Fish tacos both times I have went. The first time, they were So good... I basically devoured them in a minute. Unfortunately, the second time I went and placed the same order, I got over-breaded, over-fried tacos. The kind where the batter has turned very dark brown, with a burnt taste. Upon biting into the taco I realized 50% of each taco was burnt batter with little to no fish. I ended up eating half of them and throwing away the rest.  Its a shame because they were so great the first time, that I am tempted to reorder once more, but so bad the second time, i think I'm shooting myself in the foot. 

Only other mention- sides here are pretty small.
