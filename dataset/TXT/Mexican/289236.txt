YkOCo5ipV2he2WXIAlZb-A My first time coming here and the staff was very friendly and explained the menu and options to me. I chose the Rockport and you can choose to have it in a flour burrito, seaweed burrito, bowl, or nachos. I had mine in a seaweed burrito. It was really good. Good portion size as well. I also had the taro chips and cheese. The cheese is standard issue but the chips were very good. They have a unique, almost sweet taste to them. Highly recommend them as well. The restaurant itself was clean and well maintained. We came in the late afternoon (3pm) so there was no line or no wait to order. I will be back again and again.
