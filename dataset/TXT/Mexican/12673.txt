0FH5h58Qls1VIuXh5QORlg Showed up on a Saturday night, 7pm with a friend. The place wasn't busy at all. Maybe 3 other tables had people. 

The menu is kind of small, and the prices are above average.

We both ordered the beef tacos with rice and beans. This entree was about 16$ before tax.

An hour later our food finally arrive.  We were surprised it took at long considering how the place wasn't busy at all, and the simplicity of a taco, rice and bean dish should be to make.

The quality wasn't very good. It was alright, but not restaurant good.  I've made better tacos at home many a time.

The interior is kind of interesting, it is covered with thousands of clay sun masks and has a very mexican feel to it, however I felt it might have been a "tourist" mexican look.
