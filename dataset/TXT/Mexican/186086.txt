nwHd2MbIGz0SNG8GpFjekw My husband and I decided to eat here on a recommendation from a friend who visits Phoenix often.  Bottom line - we loved this place!!!! Great food, great prices! Staff was very friendly. We both also loved the decor.  We both ordered street tacos which had tremendous flavor and good portion size with sides of rice and beans.  Would highly recommend this restaurant!
