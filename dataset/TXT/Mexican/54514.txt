9t8PEynZGVCG1EjOQr1xBA My fiancé is from CA and he's barely going on 2 years of living in Las Vegas. The biggest disappointment was not having a good taco place like the ones in CA. We've tried a few places and Chicago Style Taco Shop was stumbled upon by his boss. He took my dad step mom and me there tonight.. we tried the Tacos de asada, pastor, and pollo. And we had the nachos de asada. Everything was hot, fresh, and so good. The red salsa was spicy and it was the best. We definitely found our spot, took us almost 2 years but it's okay. My step mom is a hard food critic and even she liked it. What made our visit even more special was Joe came out of the back and asked us about our visit. We got to conversation with him for a little bit and it was a pleasure. We definitely will be bringing family and friends and spreading the word about this spot. Good job Chicago Style.
