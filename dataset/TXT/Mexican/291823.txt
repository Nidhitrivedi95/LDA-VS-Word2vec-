I am a "skinny" margarita myself but they have a huge assortment of margaritas and tequilas that there is something for everyone.  aside from the goodstuff is the other good stuff- their food!  Their salsa which I believe is made on site, is delicious!  I didnt quite caremuch for the black bean dip but thats just my preference.  The staff is quite attentive and will refil your chips beforeyou realize you even need a refill.  The menu has a good selection but not overwhleming; I like the fried fish tacos, personally.  At night time, I did find the lighting to be a little too dark and actually had to get my iphone out to read the menu.  But overall it was a great experience and I look forward to going back.
