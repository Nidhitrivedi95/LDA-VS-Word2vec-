MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA We came to Grand Electric on a recommendation. The place is tucked away on Queen street, in a small but cool space. The decor is pretty simple, and the menu is straight forward and well rounded. We started with guac, which was well seasoned, and I loved the fact that the chips are cooked fresh to order and were hot. I tried 4 tacos, but the beef was by far the best followed by the fish. My only complaint was the music, it was WAY to loud even for a music buff like me.
