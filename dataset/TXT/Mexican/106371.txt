fkXwJHETFfJUc-gu-pyeLw One of my least favorite locations of Chipotle. I waited at least 5 minutes, maybe more, before someone finally asked for my order and the guy was standing right in front of me, staring at his coworker. They're serving line is so unorganized, at least one or two of them kept walking away randomly and left other customers and myself waiting to finish our orders. I've had my fair share of Chipotle so I feel that I'm pretty accustomed to how they serve the food just like everyone and anyone who's been to Chipotle. There was such a disconnect with the employees from beginning to end of the ordering process. It extremely slows down the overall service. When I finally reached the register to pay, there was no one there. 5 minutes later, an employee was rushing to the register from behind me... where was she in the first place? There's already a long line forming.

The food, I love, no questions ask. I switch it up between chicken and steak every now and then, and the rest is my usual add ons. The portions they give at this location, on the other hand, is debatable. When I received my burrito bowl, I wondered if there was even anything in it because it was so light, I almost though it was empty. I ate half of my order and saved the rest for my boyfriend. Even he was wondering why I bothered saving the rest, I probably could've polished it off myself because there was so little.

It's a little disappointing since the location is great to hit up after going to the gym. I'll probably order ahead next time, if I'm not feeling the drive to the Parmatown location. Chipotle is great and all, but it wouldn't hurt to be a little more organized and give a little more. It could increase the speed of service and make customers a little happier. I'm obviously not the only one who's experienced this since I'm reading about similar situations in other reviews.
