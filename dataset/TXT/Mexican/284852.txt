Y1lzSa9u-XqzC7RrQO2nig This is actually a 4.5 star review.  I really love this restaurant.  There are a few things that I think could be improved upon but mostly every time I've eaten here its been great.  We also order take-out for the office from here quite a bit.  The staff is always very nice and the service is good.  When they say spicy on their menu, they really mean it, too.  My favorites are the Fajita Burrito and the Enchillada Verdes (spicy).
