J7B-hSSYDYSIQx5xiqOJTw Wanted to love it because I like the decor and the location is great. They need to improve the food. I had chicken burritos and there was little chicken and dry crunchy rice. The wait staff was great. My companion had tacos and said there were dry also. With a few culinary improvements they would be great. It appeared they trying for a fancy taco experience and it wasn't a good fit.

New review a year later....much better food. Had the happy hour and the chicken taco Tinga. Much improved!
