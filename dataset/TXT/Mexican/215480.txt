QYuojrlW94mpEwnp0uUIWA As a customer, I never leave reviews...But for this restaurant I just had to. I came to Vegas for the first time on a business trip. After being here every other week, I thought I'd never find a good restaurant. I have had such bad experiences in every aspect at EVERY restaurant and drive thru I have visited here. When I stepped into La Parilla, it was empty so I was a bit skeptical but it turned out to be the best experience I've had here! Thank you so much to Pamela for providing such amazing customer service experience! Food was delicious but I have to say Pamela's attentive customer service is what made me give this place five stars. And by the way don't forget to try the pupusas, they are bomb!
