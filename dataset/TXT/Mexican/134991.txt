iLxG2Oo8HNSZFvJvba4W6g I order food for mostly delivery from El Toro, so my experience is strictly to do with the food and not so much so the dining experience. For your regular customer wanting  americanized mexican food, this place would suffice as an average joint. But for someone who enjoys freshly made food from Maize every time, this place can't compare on any level. The food is greasy, cheesy, mushy and not fresh at all. The guacamole is sub standard, as is the salsa. There is no fresh zing to the food at all, so I have to severely question the freshness of the ingredients used and the store practices of making food.

I would avoid eating at the place and would advise anyone the same. Moreover the delivery takes around 45 minutes, so that makes me all the more less likely to order when I can choose from a whole host of other places on campus. Two of my recommendations of places with good mexican food would be El Charro and Maize Mexican Grill. Unfortunately the seating options at Maize are lacking, and El Charro looks extremely run down. So if you are looking for decent dining atmosphere, I wouldn't go to the aforementioned places. But hey, if it is the food you care about, definitely go to one of those places and enjoy far better and might I say even cheaper food.
