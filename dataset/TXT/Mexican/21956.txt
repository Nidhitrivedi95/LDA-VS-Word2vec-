2HxaDXZmAOH6LiuzGgNdPA I had tried the location on Decatur and wasn't impressed so seeing this open just down the street I decided to give them another try.  They were slightly busy the day we went and seating was at a premium.  We got a table after about 5 minutes.  The ordering was a little crazy as the team seemed confused as this was shortly after the grand opening.  After about 10 minutes our food was brought to our table.  We got the Avocado Bacon Cheeseburger meals.  The fries were cold and rubbery.  We ate a couple and discarded them.  The burger was to say politely - boring.  The avocado had no flavor and didn't add anything to the burger.  The burger patty was also nothing special and reminded me of the patties from Carl's Jr - another place I won't eat at.  
    On a previous visit we tried the zucchini strips and onion rings which reminded me of the Flintstones - they were huge which at first seemed like a bonus.  They use cornmeal batter for the onion rings and zucchini strips which is crumbly and falls off.  It also has a grainy texture which makes things even worse.  
   I am not sure what the draw is to this place - bad food at high prices. As we sat choking down the Boring Burger we were at the window facing McDonalds.  I realized a Quarter Pounder with cheese would have been so much better than the overpriced cardboard I was currently eating.  So if in the area and need a good burger spend half the cost and go to McD's.  But there is hope for Burger lovers in the SW as Habit Burger is opening on Blue Diamond.  They will be down the street from In n Out.   Going to make things tough on what Burger to choose from - both sounds good!
