z4EIzLJlGd7gyje1Q_hKtw I went here for lunch today and thoroughly enjoyed it. I had the packard pepperoni pizza and fries from Michigan & Trumbull and it was fantastic. Cooked perfectly and the hot honey was amazing! Very clean and well maintained. It should be since it opened just a few days ago lol. I will stop and make a couple more visits in the future to try out the other 3 places. Off to a good start though!
