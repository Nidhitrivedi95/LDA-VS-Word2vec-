nsEO3MRzYLKfgtID7gvArw At one time I was lucky enough to live only 3 miles from La Parriila Suiza.
This has to be THE best Mexican joint I've ever been to and I make it a point to eat there when I get back to Phoenix.
"QUESO ESPECIAL" started it all.
VERY friendly staff and authentic Mexican atmosphere make this place great for lunch and dinner.  If I still lived 3 miles away, I'd be tipping the scales @ 300+....
