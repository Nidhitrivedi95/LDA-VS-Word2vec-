v0FdDAXvEYieRWcngbCe1Q Rude, unwelcoming staff! One lady threw an enormous handful of lettuce on my daughter's kids meal without asking what we would like or even saying so much as a word to me actuallu; then proceeded to have major attitude when I kindly asked her to prepare a different one after my daughter was upset she ruined her dish. We ordered tacos which were disturbingly blan, even with tons of hot sauce! Then I find out my total is $30.99 (insanely overpriced!) Paid it because I was starving. Over course they overcharged me for an extra drink I did not request or get. Chipotle is WAY tastier and literally 1/2 the price!!!
