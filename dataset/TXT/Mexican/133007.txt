This shop is tucked away on Kensington Avenue. It's a small space, with limited seating. Best visited in pairs.

My friend and I had the following items:

1) Mango and Strawberry Agua Fresca

I've had Agua Fresca in Mexico, and I'm sure it's not fair to compare, but this one was very light on the fruit profile. For $2, it was at a great price point, but the freshness of the fruit in question didn't sing out to me.

2) Daily Ceviche

I enjoyed this dish. Tonight it was prepared with Shrimp and Tilapia, and the lime used to marinate the seafood added that zippy zing that is so necessary in ceviche. I also liked the mashed avocado smeared on the Tostada. Nice play on textures!

3) The Gobernador (Smoked Marlin, Shrimp, and Cheese)

This is the #1 ordered item on the menu here. However, I personally found the smoke on the fish to be quite overwhelming. Marlin is an inherently oily fish, and perhaps the smoke was used to mask that, but it just didn't work for me. Combined with the shrimp and cheese, it was a hodgepodge of flavours that didn't complement each other.

4) Blackened Mahi Mahi

I love the rub on the fish! I think there was cinnamon in the mix, which lent a sweet flavour to the fish. I've never seen that before in blackening spice. Very unique! 

The portion sizes are substantial as many reviewers have pointed out before me. 2 Tacos a person is plenty. 

There's a salsa station where you are encouraged to top your tacos. I tried the Habanero and Pasilla salsas. Truth is, I think they overwhelmed the fish. I would skip them the next time around.

Grand Electric still has my favourite Tacos in the city. I think their flavour profiles are a little more well thought out, and complex.
