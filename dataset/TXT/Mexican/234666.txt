svdEhLmNmpVaIv1WLtoOvQ Updated review: My wife and I returned for another try and although I initially wanted to give this place a 4star, I feel confident now in giving it a solid 5. We started with the TNB salad, and had a variety of 6 different tacos. We had the BBQ beef, shrimp, grilled fish, pibil, crunchy chicken, and the pastor. The pastor tacos are out of this world good, for sure favorite. I strongly suggest trying a few different ones, and sharing if need be. Looking forward to coming back to try the hurache, which is always a favorite dish of mine when I come across it on a menu.  

I would have totally given this place a 4 star, but the service was really, really sub par. We had the dozen mini taco plate, and two full size pastor tacos, and the bacon wrapped jalapeño peppers. The jalapeños were really tasty, and the pastor tacos were fantastic. The dozen mini taco plate on the other hand, was a bit of a let down. Our server did not indicate to us that the minis are not served as they are described on the front of the menu. They are served with just the meat, cilantro and onions. Not as they are described with specialty toppings that I feel make the tacos unique. So do yourself a favor and order the specific tacos in full size form, they are totally worth it.
