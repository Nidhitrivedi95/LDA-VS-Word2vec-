OPcGFLP_mRt9yvgP3ALXOQ I went for lunch @ Totopo which means tortilla chip in Spanish (I had to ask) and was really impressed. I was greeted by very friendly young lady who cheerfully said Hola :) The restaurant is comfortable, with a very authentic Mexican vibe. My waitress was very attentive and helpful. I felt the menu was very diverse and the prices are super reasonable. They delivered free tortilla chips to the table with salsa and I ordered a drowned chicken burrito - that had rice cheese, green peppers, onions, red peppers it was delicious! I will definitely be back!
