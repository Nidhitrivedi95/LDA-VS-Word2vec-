TCoBE_BkDRrK0bWrh5VueQ If you live or used to live in California, you wouldn't give this place a 4 or 5 stars.. King taco baby!! Hehe.. 
This is probably the nicest and modern taco place I've eaten.. It's a very hip and good place to hang out place.. 
This restaurant is very spacious and wide selection of salsa bar.  But the taco is NOT good .. I have high expectation for this place since reading so many good reviews but disappointed in every way.
I love when taco places marinate their pastor(pork) on the rotating stand but this one have a weird flavor and was wayyy too salty..
Carne Asada taco was bland and cold.. The guy took the already cook beef out of the contianer and just chop it up.. I don't like that, I want my meat to be hot the it suppose to be.
I think the tortillas are housemade, good but too thick.. I won't be coming back here again.. Try it once and never again!!
