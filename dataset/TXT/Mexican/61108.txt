as_fyujgsdwtV56n31z-Sw Opening weekend in Fairlawn. Went with my husband and friend. We started with: Queso fundido ( melted cheese ) and tortillas. This was tasty.  
Black bean soup - texture was on point but it didn't have much flavor.
Empanadas- deep fried, five per order but they don't let you mix & max flavors. I'd skip them. 
We all ordered tacos, 3 each per their recommendation. If you have a side, keep it in mind you can order less. I left stuffed. 
My 3: crispy shrimp(spicy & ok), Rio style Chicken( good but dry), blackened fish (ok but could have been better),
Husband's 3: pastor (loved it), lamb (not really the right taste for him), braised beef (loved it)
Friend's 3: cauliflower (really liked it) fried avocado (ok and hard to eat as a taco), spicy shrimp (least favorite)
No dessert this time since we left pretty full. 
Staff was very pleasant. 

Recommendation: do the tacos. Start with the smaller amount and order more if you need more.
