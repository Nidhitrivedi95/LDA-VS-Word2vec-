JEQaPs7jNT1M2os9lJDlUA I was excited to get a group of 5 great friends together for a light brunch and several rounds of bloody Mary's. My excitement did not last long. The bloody Mary was so bland, it tasted like plain tomato juice with black pepper... However, this was not the worst part, that was they way my crepe tasted. I'm a lover of crepes. I learned how to make them as a child and they're my Go-To brunch indulgence. Now when you eat something that you love and you're confidant that you have healthy taste buds, you get very disappointed when your food tastes bad. Where I was hoping to find a delicious nutella and banana flavor, I was taken aback by the overwhelming taste of oil. Not delicious. 

Chefs can have an off day and food can turn, I get it. I don't get how a Server can then attempt to make a customer feel guilty or stupid if they send the plate back. I've worked in the service industry for many years and sending food back, gives the restaurant a chance to turn your experience around. If you messed up once, it's totally forgivable, however if you then give a crappy response to the customer, you're officially a sucky server. 

Bummed that I had such a poor experience at this cute little neighborhood eatery and even more bummed that I didn't get to enjoy a tasty crepe. 

Crepe-lessly yours,

Joan
