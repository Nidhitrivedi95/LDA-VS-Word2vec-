Ok9vikKusbG_Ue9pJf6s3Q We was in MONTREAL for few days with my family and my wife found this place.
First this place is in CHINATOWN, Montreal center,
The MEXICAN FOOD  is the Best 
I live in MIAMI  and we have good Mexican food here but THE CAPITAL TACOS mis respetos,
Super recomendados.
Amazing 
Si vas a MONTREAL, QUEBEC y quieres comer rico ve a este restaurante.
