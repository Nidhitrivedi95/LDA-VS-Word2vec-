Lhaj-hGoMgw70_vbFW9a9Q I won't be back.  First time I went was good.   Shrimp burrito and carne asada tacos were very good.  Husband had the combo with 2 scene asada burritos.   First time we loved it.  Went back, and will not be returning.  New ordered the exact same thing.  Got home, mind you we only live a few mins away.  My tacos were cold.  Meet was not warm at all.  Husband said his was just okay.   Took one bite of my shrimp taco
Burrito and spit it out.   It was shredded beef burrito not shrimp.  I hate shredded beef, not to mention it was dried up and burnt beef.   I contacted them thru their Facebook page the following day.   They responded 3 days later and wanted my contact info to relay to the store.   Haven't heard hide nor hair from them since.  To me, that is horrible customer service.  I will take my business elsewhere.   thank you very much
