db12Hn9hdoE-Ne4_NsVKSw Beer battered fish taco everyday at least once. This is one of my favorite parts of the day, this taco is absolutely delicious in every way and not to much or two little of food. The fish is freshly cooked, hot and crispy and actually juicy as well. Smothered in an excellent hot sauce (which they have a plethora of a selection compared to anywhere else in town) makes my day every time. Thank you Taco shack for openning a nice lil mom n pop food spot in downtown tempe!
