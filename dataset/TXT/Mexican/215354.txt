QYuojrlW94mpEwnp0uUIWA Burgers are my fav and yours are bomb. I had the guacamole burger. A huge fatty party with delish house made guac. (Sorry if I insulted asking if it was one of those squeeze tube guacs). Seriously-- good burger. 
Fries are large and shareable so make sure to do so. My husband got their bulgogi burger and he said it was very good. We will be back!
