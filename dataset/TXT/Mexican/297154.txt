zdE82PiD6wquvjYLyhOJNA We drove all the way here from Southwest Las Vegas because we expected good food with almost 5 stars in Yelp. We were disappointed. 

We ordered the Bulgogi Burrito and the Pork Belly Musubi. 

The bulgogi in the burrito doesn't taste like the regular stand alone bulgogi we get from restos. It's lacking in taste. My boyfriend compared it to regular carne asada.

As for the musubi, there's more rice than the pork belly, and the pork belly is not tasty enough to overcome the quantity of rice inside the musubi. 

The service is ok. It was funny to see the server and a customer argue about "Asian hot sauce". 

All in all, I expected better. Greatly disappointed.
