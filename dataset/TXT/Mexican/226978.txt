S_bG5WWbtNXhhY9Y0GTcSg This is a neighborhood MUST!! Lines can be long on weekends but worth the wait. The quality of food is amazing, the preparation of it, equally amazing! Basic menu, which is ideal for the farmhouse/warehouse interior decor. The staff (always busy) super friendly & polite.. I have been several times & look forward to many more meals here!!!
