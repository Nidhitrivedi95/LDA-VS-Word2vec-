I've been to other locations throughout the years, but it was my first time visiting this one. A chain mexican grill, like Chipotle. Service and food was decent. 

I got the carnitas bowl (slow-carb style, 4 Hour Body) -- no rice, black beans, carnitas, veggies -- onions, tomatoes, a few lime wedges. 

I love spicy and can handle the heat but it was a bad choice to add both sauces, as it was too spicy for me! The carnitas was decent, not bad. 

Lots of booth seating, not busy or crowded. We went around 7pm on Thursday night. 

Beers and a few alcoholic beverages served here as well.
