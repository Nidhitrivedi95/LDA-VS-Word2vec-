cKRGB46UJp3z3TgVlzk4tw The good thing was the waiter was super nice and attentive. Chips were greasy. They were out of the soup and the main course I wanted on a Saturday night, at dinner time???
So I ended up with chicken tortilla soup, it was barely warm, and the flavor was so so. 
I also had the brisket taco, which had great flavor but...barely warm, more on the cold side. The rice and beans were just plan cold. Food should come out hot, which makes me question how long it was sitting. 
The worst part was My husband had the salmon taco, and as we were leaving he felt sick to his stomach. Not a good experience for him, nor me!!!
The only reason for one star was for our waiter.
