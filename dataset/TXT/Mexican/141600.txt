JcMx_PIy0ROIlJWens4TAQ One of the best Mexican restaurants in the Chandler area, BUT, I was completely disappointed when I visited them this past Thursday and the waitress said they couldn't make crispy shrimp tacos for me.  Not only did she say they couldn't make them, she insisted they NEVER make them.  I beg to differ, as I was there in June and had the BEST shrimp taco plate I'd ever had (see photo)!  As a matter of fact, that shrimp taco plate was the reason I visited the restaurant again when I was in town.  Imagine my disappointment when my craving wasn't going to be satisfied.  Instead, I ended up with a very, very sad looking shrimp soft taco.  I'm still giving them a four star rating because the food and margs are excellent, they just need to get all of their chefs on board with the fact that they CAN make crispy shrimp tacos!
