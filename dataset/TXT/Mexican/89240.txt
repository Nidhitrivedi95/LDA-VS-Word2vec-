dQwjYLmQXb06CpMPIpm5-g We had a nice size group there on 11-19-11. Atmosphere is nice. Service is borderline laughable. Our server was bringing out food and had no clue what went where. At one point she said, "Oh well, you guys will figure it out". She left out plates on the table after we finished until we had to ask her to take stuff away. The food was in no way special. Totally average Mexican food. I stood at the bar when I first came in and waited close to 10 minutes for someone to even come out of the kitchen to tend the bar. I finally waived down someone and told them I had money i was willing to spend to get a beer. I finally got one. I'll never go back.
