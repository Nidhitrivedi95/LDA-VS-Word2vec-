Y_9f9tzVRaXjfT9Fa5_W9A Feeling pretty cool that I'm writing the first review. Anyways, this place is freaking delicious! Their meats have great flavor and I love how many toppings you can choose from. Tonight they did a grand opening special, $2.99 for a burrito, drink, and cookie. All of the staff was very friendly. 

I will most certainly come back here and would recommend to anyone looking for some flavorful grub!
