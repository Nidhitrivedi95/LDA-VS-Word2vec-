9KeJfn7-6DFfUFoZLu_DNQ I am from Toronto and my boyfriend and I have been wanting to eat here since last time we came to Montreal, however we were silly and didn't know we had to make reservations. Well this time we did, at 9pm and we're actually moved up to 8:30pm which was awesome! and I must say the food and service were PHENOMENAL! I wish I knew my waiters name but he was beyond great and helped us order all the favorites and we were very pleased.. My boyfriend LOVED the cod tacos and I devoured the steak tacos and the chicken tacos (personally, I was obsessed with the chicken tacos. But make no mistake that the steak was amazing too) we also had the mushroom quesadilla and it too was just too good for words!  We ended with the churros and fought for the last one, they tasted great with the nutella sauce given. The vibe here is so amazing and I am looking forward to coming back to Montreal again just so I can come back to Escondite! This place truly is a hidden gem! 

Make sure to make reservations though! They get crazy busy simply because there food is that good!!
