pyeoyouJWxxcwzfugfessQ Finally made it into Taqueria as we had been there twice before finding out they are closed on Monday.  The decorations and ambience is very nice.  Had I not seen picture posts on Yelp, would have been at a loss as there are no visuals on the menu nor posted in the room of any of the dishes.  Nice outside seating if you so desire.  Server was very friendly and helpful, but a little slow for our service as he had one large table by himself.
My husband had his all time favorite Nachos, no meat unless you wish to pay more.  Nachos were huge and very tasty with roasted corn.  I had Al Pastor street taco which is on the sweet side.  I ate it but would not order again, it also was quite greedy.  Prices on some things we felt were way to high.  I will go back as there menu holds items not seen in other places around Phoenix and would like to try.  All in all we enjoyed our date afternoon experience.
