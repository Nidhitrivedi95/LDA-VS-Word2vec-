fK1oj0dk9Bc6KsBk5mMDxg When I usually feel like eating Mexican, always end up at Taco Bell or at my ex wife's - so Playa Cabana Cantina is an upgrade for me. 

The place is cool and the food is pretty great. Nice location to have a few drinks and eat some good food. One of my Tinder premium 1st date location.
