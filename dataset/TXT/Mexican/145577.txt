JIfSollg32ifUzTw2K4PDQ I'm a fan. Some hispanic friends straight up refuse to go to any other taco trucks, so convinced they are that this is the best spot in Vegas. I hadn't been in a while so I popped by after a game at Cashman. This spot is 24/7, and despite less workspace, put out better product than their brick and mortar restaurant a few blocks to the west. 

The tacos are solid, with pliable, thick corn tortillas that are heated but not fried or oily. The lengua is good and the asada is smoky, but for a place named after the al pastor, that particular protein didn't blow me away. The quesadillas are huge and though it's hard to go wrong with chicken and cheese, it's one of my favorites. Always ask for their orange salsa-  it looks like it would be habanero-based but it has a lot of flavor and not a ton of spice. This is one of the few places I don't care for the house green salsa.
