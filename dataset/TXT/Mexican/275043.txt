xceERetY6Q9Pu_BQ32xpeA Everything in the airport is overpriced - this is the first airport meal I've been happy to pay the price for. I walked up to the cashier and with a song-song tune he let me know about the special. A Navajo taco with carne asada (his recommendation) with beans, lettuce, guac, sour cream, tomatoes onions, jalapeños... best airport meal I've had. Quick service and nearly no line. Sandwiched between two other eateries. I wish I had a place like this near home.
