The carne asada was chewy, not great quality, and not tender.  My girlfriend didn't finish her tacos.  The rice was pretty bland as well.  They wouldn't give a discount for a coworker who just wanted a plain quesadilla and they charged her $11.   Just want to give you a heads up before you go here.
