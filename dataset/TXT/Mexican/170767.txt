m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw Awesome service, great food and ambience. Their taquitos and chicken tacos were amazing and so were the rice & beans. They have a bar making all drinks so they're all top notch quality which was awesome, I hate watered down Coke. The staff was very accommodating when I asked to move due to being sat next to two screaming babies in a small room. The price was reasonable for the area, around $20 a person.
