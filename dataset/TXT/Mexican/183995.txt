NPHZkn1e-tSJAbo8Zm9rYw I have to totally disagree with the single other review posted to this point.  I heard about Burrito Banditos about three weeks ago, and have been about 5 times so far.  

First, I love this kind of food, these big burritos assembled to order and pressed on a flat top.  I know its common in many places, but in the GTA its a newish food genre.  Anyhow, I find these things like super comfort food - crispy on the outside, soft and warm and gooey on the inside, and all that with a mix of savoury flavours.  

I don't eat meat, so I am really happy that they have a veggie burrito with the "fake meat' (soy protein) option.  Though I don't eat meat, I do miss the texture of ground meat in something like a burrito or a chili.  I use the same kind of textured soy protein at home in my own cooking.  

Aaaanyhow, I got off point.  I like the place, I like the energy, the friendly staff, and the delicious burritos.  If there was one thing I'd change, I wish they had some sort of a side order, the way you always get fries or rings with a burger.   I'm not sure what goes with burritos, but one more thing in the mix would kick it up one more notch for me.  Oh, and a beer.  A beer would be good.

To me, it's a great value.  My kids love it, I love it, my buddy loves it.  super yum.
