eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg Nice service and atmosphere but the food .. The food is just EH.. I got the enchiladas del mar and it was covered inside and out with so much cheese you couldn't even fully enjoy the seafood or the delicious cream sauce. I started to feel sick eating it and even more annoyed that it was almost 30 dollars for this plate! My fiancé got the cochito pibil torta for 14 dollars ,which was okay.. It was skimpy on the protein and you could go anywhere else and get a comparable quality torta for half the price. They definitely are taking advantage of the food network exposure..
