-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg Really like the food here.  Great variety of tacos--love taco Tuesday. I really like the fish tacos.  Blood Orange margarita is very good. Nice Happy Hour. Service is great, casual.   Nice outdoor seating area. Love the ambience and energy in here.  A younger demographic then Postino's next door if that matters. My hubby had a burrito that was great.  Wish I could remember which one.
