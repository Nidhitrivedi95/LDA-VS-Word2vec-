kvxSYzWonG0Gf0TlOF0nkA It's Taco Bell what can you say. Food is just as good as everywhere else. But what makes this Taco Bell awesome is the drive-through attendant. He is amazing! His personality, his demeanor, his excitement, and manners make for such a pleasant experience. His name is Patrick(fluffy hair, glasses) and he deserves a raise. I don't think I have ever had such a positive experience in the Drive-Thru. What a great guy!
