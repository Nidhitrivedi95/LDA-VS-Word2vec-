UODskmUq92u6d2SH5MaO6Q Yesterday my daughters two friends and I went on a taco hunt (she's away at college so I take them out from time to time); trying tacos from different places all over the valley. We went to about 10 different places, and this was our last stop. At each place, we got the lowest cost taco. A trend was beginning to build that the lower the cost of the taco, the better it was. When we looked at the receipt and realized these were the most expensive of all, we were concerned they'd taste the worst- which was disappointing at first. However, much to our dismay, they were the best ones. We were beyond stuffed from eating so many tacos, but we definitely ate the whole thing. We tried the carne asada taco, and it was generously filled. The soft corn taco shells were warmed, and we had just the right amount of fresh salsa. The meat was perfectly seasoned and tender. This was the only location we sat in (we went through the drive thru for everyone else). The girl at the register was really sweet. We told her what we'd spent the day doing and she thought it was so fun (it really is!). I hope they are around for a long time- the location isn't the greatest (pretty tucked behind everything) and I'd hate to have them meet the demise of Samurai Sam's because of it.
