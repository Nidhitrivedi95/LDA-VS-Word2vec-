zCmwErM82hdKl4L2UixDJw What a great happy hour!  Mon.-Fri. 4-7 at the bar area, half off margaritas and $1 off tacos (excluding the monthly flavors).  They have other deals too, but these ones are the ones that speak to me.  I'm not really all that good at creating my own tacos so I usually go with one of the recommendations.  I am a total fan of the pineapple jalapeno margarita.  If you've never had one, it's a must, especially during happy hour.
