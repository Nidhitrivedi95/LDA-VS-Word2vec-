ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA This place is an absolute charm. The atmosphere is a little loud and it is to be expected. The seats are close together but being from New York City, this is quite common. Actually like the idea of putting our name in and being texted when the table was ready.

We had time to visit the bar. The bartender was great but not fast. We took our drinks out to the patio and sat under the stars awaiting our text. We noticed a lot of people smiling and a lot of people enjoying the atmosphere. It's nice, casual, fun. When our table was ready, we are pleased to hear it was outside and there was a heater available to us. 

The food was delivered and was absolutely amazing. I started with the roasted cauliflower. It was a mixture of flavors that typically one would not place together. However they make it work and work well. I then had the pork sugo  which was superb. 

I would recommend this place to the locals and  anyone wanting to come to midtown went evening. It's not too far from the Osborne light rail.
