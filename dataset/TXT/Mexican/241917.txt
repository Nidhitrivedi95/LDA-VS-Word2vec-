TCoBE_BkDRrK0bWrh5VueQ I obviously have to go back...like tomorrow.  Yes it was that good. Granted I got there at 10:30 PM and was starving but if it was just ok, I'd say so.  I had a chicken, carnitas, and barbacoa tacos.  Each one I ate I said...I like this one best.  Their habanero hot salsa was HOT (thank you...finally I find a good hot sauce that doesn't come out of a jar).  And their tomatillo salsa was mild but not bland.  Service was great, prices great, ambiance cool (I think I might hang out there late night on weekends when I have nothing else to do.) 

And yes the ordering is a little weird but I've found a lot of places that become legendary usually have some quirks.  Get over it...learn your first time like I did by asking questions and owning that feeling of being an idiot. And then enjoy the BEST tacos I've had in Vegas bar none.
