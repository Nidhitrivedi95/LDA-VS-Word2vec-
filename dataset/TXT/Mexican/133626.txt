iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg Rated best taco place in the city,  and COULD NOT AGREE MORE!!!!!!! When your teeth have the the treat of devouring one of these pieces of art, you'll think you've gone to heaven.....the explosion of quality, authentic flavours cannot be compared with!!!Don't let the teeny-tiny store size deceive you, inside the little shop with only one table and a window ledge to eat on, you will find taco glory!

I came at around 3:30ish, and man it was packed (where although it's not always fun to wait for food, a massive line at a restaurant almost always means your in for a delicious, worth-the-wait meal). My boyfriend and I ordered 3 tacos to split: a pork taco, shrimp and cheese, and a battered haddock. All were exquisite and very filling!!!  It's likely because there is sooooo muuuuccchhh meat and filling in each one. 

This would be a great place to visit during summer, as you can order your food and simply eat it outside (since it'll likely be packed as usual inside the store). This truly is the best taco joint in the city, and strongly encourage trying it out! :)
