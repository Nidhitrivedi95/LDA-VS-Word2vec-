J7KlrDFrriWoRkIUVNRPbg In Las Vegas for one night. Checked Close Mexican Restaurants and chose Tacos & Ritas based on other reviews. Man did we hit it great. Everything we ordered was great. Food was great and the staff was even better. Our server was a great young man.

If I am back in Las Vegas, this is the place I am going. 
Great place, you will not be disappointed!
