WpJYt8aA60xL_U8x3JbASA This place has been around for awhile however I never had a craving for burrito-ish kind of food...but I thought it would be a good alternative since we have tried pretty much everything else in the area. We first went to another burrito place nearby but after seeing the lack of seating/small place we yelp'd reviews for Burrito Boyz to see what this location was like. We ended up coming here instead for the main reason of more spacious seating. This location has a lot of offerings for meat and non-meat eaters which is great for large groups. No need to worry about anyone getting left out! On my first visit I ordered the steak naked burrito however it was a bit dry due to lack of sauce (my decision). Nachos and water for an extra $2. I have been back here since then, and I have decided that I prefer the panfried fish + shrimp naked burrito. Probably one of my new favourite spots to eat now. Plus the bit of guac is included but if you want more...we'll you know the famous line. "Guac is extra!". Ya ya I know guac is always extra. 

The only negative would be the staff can seem a bit stand offish. The music at the front is a bit loud so when you tell them what you want you'll have to SHOUT. Even then they might not hear you, they can give you a bit of attitude for requesting extra veggies too.
