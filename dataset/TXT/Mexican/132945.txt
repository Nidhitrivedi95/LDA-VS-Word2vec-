iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg Just go and get the Gobernator. 

I just came back from Mexico and I can't say this is exactly what I had on the streets of Mexico City, but regardless I was pleasantly surprised! Lots of flavor and worth every penny! There is so much going on, I honestly couldn't tell I was eating tuna and shrimp, it really tasted like meat which I actually enjoyed. 

The one problem is that one taco won't fill you up, even though there is a lot piled on.
