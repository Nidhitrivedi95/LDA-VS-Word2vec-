7GoKSLqOTDqkH_Uv9ve5cA I've eaten here many times but tonight's experience is very upsetting. The restaurant has created a digital coupon, but won't let you use it unless you print. When I ask to speak to the manager she wouldn't come talk to me, sent another staff member to explain to me they can't accept digital coupons cause staff members have given discounts when they shouldn't and now they need proof. When you issue a coupon using digital media stand by it!! Your staff misuse is not my problem!
