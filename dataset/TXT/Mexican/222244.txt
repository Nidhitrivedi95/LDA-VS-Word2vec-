rRAKvF-E_fnikHK4WSpXrA I'm really a huge fan of Qdoba but man this place was depressing. Went for lunch, my coworkers usually like Chipotle. So i figured why not show them Qdoba. But man was I embarrassed, we went in at 12:15pm and it was completely empty. The food didn't look fresh nor did the restaurant look clean. Will not be coming back to this Qdoba.
