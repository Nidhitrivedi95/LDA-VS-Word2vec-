r8Jr-7YfkhJL2nxk9lxUNg If you enjoy delicious more traditional Mexican food that isn't full of grease (let's face it some people do), then this is the place for you! For the past 5 years we've been driving 20 minutes to eat here! The staff is friendly and attentive, and the environment is casual, but nicely decorated.  

The complimentary 2 baskets of chips and salsa are so addicting and I position the basket away from myself. Tip: if you like it spicy ask for the HABANERO SAUCE to add some heat. Flavor is great either way though.

The RED SANGRIA is really good and you get A LOT for your $. I usually will share with a friend. Friends who've ordered the white sangria wished they had ordered the red. I also enjoy the MARGARITAS on the rocks!

My husband ALWAYS orders and loves THE COLORADO...it's his favorite and he is not the adventerous food type.

I personally am not afraid to mix it up, but I always order my food with either CHICKEN OR CARNE ASADA. When I want to be healthy--er I get the a la carte soft corn tacos. When I get what I want...it's the SWEET POTATO ENCHILADAS!!! I have to say this flavor isn't for everyone...but I LOVE THEM! The CLASSIC AND MOLE CHICKEN ENCHILADAS are great, too...frankly, I have never eaten anything here (with chicken or carne asada) that I didn't like. At our last visit, I tried the PANUCHO-carne asada...yummy, but I hate it when my tortillas gets soggy, which happened after I ate the first one, so I would flip them over next time.

Dessert...well to be honest I stuff myself with chips and salsa (food I would have as a last meal) so I never have room...but I bet it's good :)

BOTTOM LINE: I love this place and it's always worth and the calories...and the drive!
