HOlDxrYqfoJrVq2Eo-_LKQ Went here not very long after opening and as you would expect, there are still some kinks. Service is very good though, everyone very friendly. I had the fried fish and fries which were a little greasy but since it's new I know this may only be due to the new-ness of the place. Don't make a special trip but if you're passing by, it's worth a shot.
