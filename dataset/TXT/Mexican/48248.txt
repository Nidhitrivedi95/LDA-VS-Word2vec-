89uU51kOiQXbJHVA3C6XMQ I worked  in Phoenix, AZ; and everyone who lives/works in Phoenix knows about Carolina's.  First of all, it is hands down the best Mexican food I have ever had.  Secondly, I could feed my office staff of 9 for lunch for $60. So great food, that everyone enjoyed, and inexpensive.   You can also purchase fresh hand made tortillas, and bring your own container to purchase enchilada sauce.  I would recommend the Cheese Enchilada combo.  This restaurant is one of the few places I miss during the time I lived in Arizona.  It's located in a cinder block building, no frills, and seriously awful neighborhood in Phoenix. There is a parking lot, but it is often full.   When you arrive the line is out the door, everyone from secretaries superior court judge picking up their order.Call your order in for pick up, it's the easiest way not to spend all day in line.
