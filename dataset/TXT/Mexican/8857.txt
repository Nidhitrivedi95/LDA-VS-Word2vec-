_u1Bq7QsgMUXSMex8QHqLQ We were in the area so this was our post Saturday night food choice.  I can't believe I've never tried Burrito Boyz.

You order, pay, choose your toppings and wait until they call for your number. Luckily, we arrived just before the midnight rush and waited for about 10 minutes. I've been told it can take a lot longer. I had their famous small halibut burrito on a whole wheat wrap with all of the fixings minus beans. I opted for their XXX Homemade Hot Sauce and salsa on the side ... oh dear, luckily for me it was on the side because it had tons of heat. My lips were burning but I couldn't stop.  The halibut was incredibly tender, flaky and juicy. SO good and filling but I was only able to finish 2/3 of my burrito and subsequently after my date finished his large halibut, he inhaled the rest of mine.

Fresh, cheap and great size. I will return and as suggested by many Yelpers, I will try the halibut and shrimp mix. If you enjoy Tex-Mex, you will love Burrito Boyz. This place is simply amazing but do keep in mind that line-ups and waiting time can be long.
