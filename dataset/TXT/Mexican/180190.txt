N5CL5HLS6lyltw-OjjBrOw Only reason for 2 stars is because the restaurant is cute and outdoors. Terrible Mexican food. We ordered carne asada and it was overly condimented. There's no need to condiment like that a good piece of meat.  The beans tasted like canned beans and were extra salty as everything else. I would never recommend it or go back!!!
