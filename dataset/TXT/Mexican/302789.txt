zwNLJ2VglfEvGu7DDZjJ4g I want to thank the people at Arribas for accommodating our family. Was looking for someplace to go on Saturday night. Around six. Very busy time. Called ahead to see if there was a wait because we were coming with 2 kids and someone in a wheelchair we checked a few places closer to us first . Got there and they had everything ready for us. A high chair a sling for the baby and enough room for the person in the wheelchair. Food was great! Thank you for a nice evening
