T2tEMLpTeSMxLKpxwFdS3g I ate at CFT for the first time this week with some coworkers. Amazing! I had the chicken quesadilla. I love their chips and salsa. I can't wait to return. The service was .... ok. There was one rude hostess. However our waitress was fantastic. I would return. The outside patio is perfect for a afternoon lunch when the weather is nice. Thanks Cabo!
