oOGLDf2rzeCPS7UQ8hhPlQ I ordered the poke bowl through ritual (Ritual offers exclusive perks at this location, one per ritual member). I like the ingredients they used in the Poke bowl and they are pretty generous comparing to other poke bowl places I've tried. One thing I think they should improve though, is to put more rice in the bowl. I agree with one of the previous reviews that the rice to toppings ratio is like 1:3. I normally don't like eating rice but the toppings are too savory to eat without the rice. Otherwise it would've been perfect.  I will try the sushi burger or sushi burrito next time.
