7m1Oa1VYV98UUuo_6i0EZg I've been hearing about Paradise Valley Burger Company for years now and last Saturday, we were in the area and figured we might as well give it a shot! Apparently it has been on Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives and the episode had aired on Friday so it was absolutely packed! But, we were there so we waited, and waited, and 45 minutes later our burgers arrived! I went with the standard PV Burger with cheddar and all the fixins. It was topped with pickled onions {love this!}, cucumber, tomato, lettuce, and a yummy sauce. It had two thin patties and a delicious soft bun. For sides, we ordered the sweet potato tots and seasoned french fries, both tasty! 

The burger was good but honestly, not sure if it is worth ALL of the hype and definitely wasn't worth the 45 minute wait when we were hangry. I'm still a fan of In-N-Out for both price and taste any day! Total for two of us to have lunch here, it came out to a little over $20. Since we live so far away, we probably won't be back but i'm glad we finally tried it! Despite the slow service, the crew working there was SO nice and attentive!!
