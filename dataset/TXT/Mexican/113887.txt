GETVAz5SCk8rFziexV54Aw WARNING  for dinner 5/5/17: Came in for cinco de mayo and they had a single page printed menu with one a couple items available. No descriptions were provided at all. No cheese dip was available for the yelp offer. When we asked for it, a manager came out and told us that it was impossible because ALL THE FOOD IS PRE-MADE and they are just REHEATING IT, and making cheese dip takes too long?!?! Reheating it? That's food poisoning waiting to happen. Also there were no taco available at all and the place wasn't even busy..
