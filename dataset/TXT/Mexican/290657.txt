YQFcxE9UXrKc-QuTUu7twQ In the midst of tourist-Town, this is a nice surprise.  Happy hour is a good one.  Small portions on apps but the quality is present.  The well concocted and presented buffalo cauliflower is a must try, especially if spicy is your thing.  The prickly pear margarita with spicy salt is a not-too-sweet genius bevy.  Tacos are their thing.  Very casual atmosphere with good energy.  Patio sits along Scottsdale Road but it wasn't an issue for us.  Metal bar stools at high tops are a bit smaller.  Fresh outdoor lounge area is seat yourself, if available.  Service very friendly and accommodating.
