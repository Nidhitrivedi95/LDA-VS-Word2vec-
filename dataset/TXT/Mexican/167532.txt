LtO6vTBfYzlgWArn3kRe_A I read the reviews on yelp about tacos El gordo. So I had to try it out. When I drove up there was a crowd of people ordering. Coming from California I expected this place to be like King Taco. We ordered the Carne Asada fries and some al pastor tacos.  The Carne Asada on the fries were burnt and to salty. The pastor on the tacos were actually good. I will continue to look for a good taco place in Vegas.
