UZsxZdWt0quvtN0cAmiVUw Maybe the best tacos in Vegas, but definitely the best (and only?) handmade gorditas in town. I highly, highly recommend the pastor gorditas.  The tacos are also very good - check out the "giro" tacos (carve asada with grilled onions and guac). My favorite taco might be their birria, which sadly isn't part of their regular menu. But when it's available, I always eat at least three.
