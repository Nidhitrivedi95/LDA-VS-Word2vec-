J7B-hSSYDYSIQx5xiqOJTw Very disappointed.  First, if you go, make sure it's during happy hour!  My niece chose this place for her birthday get-together. She, my mom or sister have not been here before.  I was once, last summer, and thought it was a great place.  I knew they had good chips and salsa and pretty tasty margaritas.  Server, "H", needs to go back into training.  She was very frumpy and without a smile or even eye contact.  She took our drink and food orders. We ordered a flight and individual margarita's.  The flight and one drink comes out and is being served by someone else.  Flight was good, single drink was not the way it was ordered.  The guy who served it didn't know what kind it was so we sipped it to try and guess, it ended up being cucumber, which I ordered, but I asked for a salted rim.  All drinks came separately, as well as the food!  And served by others, not our server.  You can count the people in this place, so being busy was not an excuse.   Food was ok, drinks were fine, until my mom found a hair in her rice and beans!  Total turn off.  She told our server, who said " I am sorry!" That's all!  Really??  The manager came over immediately and apologized.  We asked our server for the check.  We looked it over and found my mom's meal and drink were comped.  Server tells us " thank you, I hope you have a better evening".  Not good!  I don't see this place lasting long at all!
