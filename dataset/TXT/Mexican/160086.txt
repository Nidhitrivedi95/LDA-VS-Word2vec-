kXl44keW3wZaJpjEqHk30g Not all farmer boys restaurants are the same. I have been to a number of them in Southern California and they are a known quantity, so when I travel through North Las Vegas I have tried to hit this Farmer boys location. Prepared for a line, I came in on a Sunday evening and the only real line was the drive-through window. With no one in front of me, I waited more than five minutes to have someone take my order. no one was at the counter, and there was no one in front of me or behind me. Two people on headsets were busy taking orders from the drive-through window which progressed nicely. I finally ordered, and then proceeded to see a number of people in the drive-through window be served their food first, at least for cars. While waiting, a young family entered the restaurant went to the counter and we're helped immediately. When I was finally served, I took my food to go and, of course, fries were cold.
The order and manner in which customers are served is important. Customers notice, even if employees do not. I will not be back there anytime soon.
