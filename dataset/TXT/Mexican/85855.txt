db12Hn9hdoE-Ne4_NsVKSw I enjoyed their kale burrito but the service absolutely sucked. I have consistently read that this place is mediocre and that's how I would describe my experience. I came in during the middle of the afternoon when it was empty and the cashier seemed annoyed when I asked about vegetarian options. Clearly, business is going well for this place.
