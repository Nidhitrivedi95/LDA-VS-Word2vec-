LpVNpw2-Bn9iHVON33auKw Used to be really good. The food is still tasty,but they got rid of the Coke Freestyle machine and are charging for the chips (that weren't ever really that good unless they were free). It's too bad. It was a really great place, but they are outpricing themselves now and are probably slowly on their way out unless they go back to their old ways. The place was like a ghost town when I had lunch here today and every other time it was ALWAYS packed. I guess I am not the only one that feels cheated this time coming in. I understand business is business and I hope they read these reviews and see they have made a mistake with these changes. I won't be coming back, which is unfortunate because until now it was one of my favorite places to eat and to take people.  I wish them the best.
