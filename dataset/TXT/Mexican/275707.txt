xEBor41OFpeeKdcCZ2sfMg We were greeted by hostess who did not seem the friendliest. We were quoted and sat in the beautifully decorated bench underneath the Tv in the waiting area. 

Once we were sat several minutes went by before we were greeted. Mind you this is our first time here and we were just a party of two. So we start to browse the menu. I decided to order something off the vegetarian friendly section in the back of the menu.

When we received our food I discovered my order was completely wrong and we had no silverware, I had ordered a bean and cheese burrito and I received a chicken chimichanga... It took another 8 minutes to actually get out server's attention. When all was corrected and we finished, we realized were faced with the challenge of how we're we going to get our server's attention to get our check? 

I have to confess that the busboys were more helpful and attentive than our server. They offered to take our plates once they saw that we were finished and I even asked one for a take out box which he brought me with a smile. 

In conclusion, the food, is nothing special. The service I can live without. The reason why they get two stars is because of the polite busboys and their large menu selection.
