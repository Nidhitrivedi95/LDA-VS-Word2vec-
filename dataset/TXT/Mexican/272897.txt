WVzCMOvn9MnEwTC20GmIWg I rate this place two stars simply for the overall decor and ambiance. 

The service was quick and friendly although my cocktail came at least 5-10 minutes after the main course. 

The overall food quality is horrible and hardly authentic. 

We started with the chunky guac which was nothing special but the tastiest thing I tried.

It was unfortunately served with a plate of broken tortilla chips. At first, I thought this was a mistake until I noticed every other table was served the same thing. 

Needless to say, these should have really been discarded. 

I ordered the taco trio with shrimp, fish and chicken as my main course. 

Flour tacos fell apart upon touch so at that point I'm thinking this should have  really been served with a knife and fork. 

The taste was no better.  The shrimp was so fishy it was inedible and the fish and chicken were both bland. 

I ordered a mojito on the rocks to drink. It was also disappointing because it wasn't cold enough (not enough ice) though the taste was okay. 

This place has amazing potential. A new chef is needed stat; otherwise, I don't see them surviving.
