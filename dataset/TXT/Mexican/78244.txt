CLthP1yn32xlBswIbsLIjQ Open 24-hours and adjoining a somewhat divey bar (Money Plays) that happens to serve up a very respectable selection of cerveza: these are the two things that make El Taco Feliz a spot worth a visit. Yes, you can even take your tacos next door to enjoy video poker, televised sports and beer. 

The service is great. The atmosphere is sparse, and as for the tacos, they definitely hit the spot. They are $2/piece and come topped with the works, including guacamole. We sampled the carne asada and the carnitas. I would stick with the carnitas, as our carne asada came out a tad too crispy, and it wasn't dripping with flavors. The carnitas while not spiced up did have a huge mound of solid, smokey pork. Unfortunately, their spicy salsa wasn't burning down any houses. 

But if tacos and dives are two of your favorite things, this might be your private paradise.
