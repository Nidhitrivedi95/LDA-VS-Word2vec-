svdEhLmNmpVaIv1WLtoOvQ This place is so good! I ventured here on a Friday around 10pm and it was packed! It smelled so yummy and it WAS so yummy. The chips and guac were great and the margarita was perfect. The tacos were so good with the homemade tortillas. I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu!
