Te-BqwJZt8S0fu9ltlq3Eg This is a nice, clean, and appropriately-decorated Mexican restaurant on the main street in Bedford, Ohio. There is a good outside seating area, for nice-weather days. I ordered the $5.99 lunch special- Chili Relleno, Beef Taco, Refried Beans, and Rice, with Chips & Salsa & Coleslaw appetizer. All of it was delicious. RJT
