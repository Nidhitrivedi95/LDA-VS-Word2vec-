XpyYSWF-8xi_aZ67RUuk2Q Disappointed.  We finally had a chance to try this place.  45 minute wait for two people on a Friday at 6.  The food was pretty aweful. We started with grilled stuffed jalepenos.  The plate was covered in filler, but we could only find one jalepeno.  My Plato Mexicano must have sat on the warming tray a while because the plate was too hot to touch, but the beans and sauces all had a film on them.  The tamale was dry and way too thick while the taco was stale.  Just a big let down overall.  The service was ok once we got a table and the location looks like it would be a great place for a drink after the summer hear passes, but we probably won't be back for dinner.
