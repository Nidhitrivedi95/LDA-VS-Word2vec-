q7MorRPzU_J-iekeDKUKgw I have not been back to Reposado Bar & Lounge since I attended an Yelp Elite Event here. All I remembered I had a really good time? 

Back again with some of my fellow Yelp friends on a weeknight. The place was quiet and I remembered we were the loudest table? We talked about future bachelorette and bachelor parties that involves strip joints? I think?

I shared a Herrudura Flight ($30). Someone had an anejo Manhattan ($12.39) and told me it was good. Another person gave me his shot of Tromba Blanco  ($8.41) because it was not his thing, he enjoyed his Stratford Pilsener ($4.87) way more... And someone got really happy drinking her Virgin Sangrita ($1.33). 

Reposado is definitely a great place to hang out and chill with your friends. 

I need to go back again, maybe after a few shot of Tequlia, I will remember more?!
