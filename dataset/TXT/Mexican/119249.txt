GrwvBAEALujIOPQeOfN1vA My FAVORITE restaurant in all of Arizona!! They have the best green corn tamales, chimis and pretty much any other Mexican food you can think of. It's a family owned restaurant so they will take great care of you! We always leave happy with the hot food and happy with the service.
