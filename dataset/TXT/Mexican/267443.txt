wKA2y-F_fPcBDOkpzDB9eQ We came here on a Sunday day morning. I was ecstatic to find that they open early and you can get lunch. 
When we entered in we were we were greeted by the friendly staff and we were seated immediately. Again it was early so they weren't to busy.  
Our waiter Jorge was awesome and very attentive. He kept our cups full and was had patience with our five year old.  We learned he had a young daughter and he certainly is great with kids. 
They offer a soup for the table which is flavorful and delicious.  Our food arrived and both dishes we orders were really good. 
No complaints 
The establishment isn't in the greatest area, and there is a bus stop right outside and someone was digging through the garbage while we parked.  

I think it's a must try if your looking for good Mexican food in a comfortable sit down restaurant.
