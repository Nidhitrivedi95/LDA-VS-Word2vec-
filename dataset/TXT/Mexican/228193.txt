S6BixeT6xkktY3keKSyYrQ Chipotle is fairly reliable, you know what you can expect and shouldn't be disapponted. The burrito is the obvious standard but don't look over the burrito bowl, it makes a nice meal and often enough for a snack later. I order without lettece so it can be easily reheated. Average meal will run you about $7. They also serve beer for $3-$4.
