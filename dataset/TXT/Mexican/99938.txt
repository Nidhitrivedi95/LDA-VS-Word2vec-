eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg Have been going to Barrio Cafe for years Live in North Scottsdale but the Concinita Pibil is so worth the drive to downtown Phoenix! Wait staff is extremely friendly, and the table side guacamole is something special. You get a very unique vibe from the time you walk in to the restaurant from the back door. Love this place!
