P8TQOkplgiQDdHRUj-IZRA Took a totally spontaneous spot in here for lunch last week, and I enjoyed my meal! I had a Mexican breakfast option, so it wasn't anything incredibly interesting, but it was tasty and flavourful. Really tasted fresh, too. They have a wide selection of baked goods in the front, too! The only thing that bothered me about my experience here is that the food was brought out at different times for my friend and I. Other than that, friendly and authentic restaurant that I would visit again! :)
