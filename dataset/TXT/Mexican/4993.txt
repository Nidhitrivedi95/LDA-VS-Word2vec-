-X_w25LQmz6SDcJIFyAPJw Yummy carne asada tacos!!!! Lots of carne asada in each one and their pico de galo is excellent. 

The shredded beef isn't very flavorful, but the proportion of meat to cheese and lettuce is good in their tacos, and hand made hard shells are crispy but don't fall apart like other crispy taco shells.

Rolled tacos are good. Again, the meat doesn't have much flavor, but add their green salsa and it's no biggie. They are smothered with guacamole and cheese.
