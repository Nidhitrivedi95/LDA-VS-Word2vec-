S_bG5WWbtNXhhY9Y0GTcSg Found this place on the way back to our hotel by downtown Phoenix. Really cute and quaint breakfast and lunch spot, love the decor and ambiance of the place. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The food was great, I ordered the breakfast wrap and my husband got the fàme omelette with fresh squeezed OJ and an iced vanilla latte. Everything was delicious, one of the best OJs we've ever had. Great place for a breakfast meetup, sol as we found it on our vacation here!
