zN4f3aLeCuIhCTPRH0di-A We went here on a whim around 9:30pm. I felt bad with it being close to closing time, but the staff was attentive and friendly! The food was very good: love their salsas and the gnocchi is very tasty! I also has some of the pork belly tamale and cheese chile relleno... I'll ask for light green sauce next time as it was too spicy for me, but was very flavorful! My dish also came with a big bowl of pozole! Super good, and a lot of food!!
