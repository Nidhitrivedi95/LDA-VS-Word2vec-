N-5j18ODfZKH_Q5p__MoSw The truck came to my work today and it was a bad experience. As a vegetarian, it can be a gamble if I order anything from off a grill. I usually ask if there is a way to clean off a small section before my food is cooked. Most kitchens are very nice and have no issue. The woman today was rude and said that this could not be done. I would think after getting paid so much from a corporation to cater to it's employees, and not wanting to make a customer sick, that she would have taken the time to make sure my food was prepared with no danger of contamination.

Other co-workers also commented that she was rude. Most thought the food was good, but as I said, it was not just me who had a bad experience with the woman who took our orders.
