wDfz8ap9xWzj46mtNDcT9A Just a simple review:

-Food was okay, at least it wasn't cold.

-Very cramped and crowded.

-Food doesn't come out at the same time.

-Takes forever to get the bill and get someone to pick up the check when you're ready to pay.

-No host, just a waitress that is across the room to point you to the least dirty table that's empty. 

-The bathroom could use some soap and paper towels. And perhaps a cleaning.

All I got. At least their not rude.
