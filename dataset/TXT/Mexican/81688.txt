d_L-rfS1vT3JMzgCUGtiow I enjoyed this restaurant, my husband was on the fence. It is in the Mandalay Bay resort and I find all of the resort restaurants to be overpriced so we paid ~$100 for lunch, 2 entrees and 4 drinks. However I enjoyed the complimentary chips and salsa trio as well as my entrée. The salsa verde  or tomatillo (?) salsa was my favorite while husband preferred the traditional salsa. I'm sure we could find much cheaper food outside of the resort but I don't mind paying for convenience so I wouldn't hesitate to return here if I didn't feel like leaving the resort.
