ow_IvjN9qWwPyOzEQAYV3A my entire family loves this place!..tacos are 1$ on mon, tues and Wednesday.  We've tried a lot of different spots and this is by far one of the very best!  We have tried many different menu choices and have not been disappointed one time....AND since I've first written my review 7 months ago, my family and I still love this place..We recently placed an order for 4 dozen tamales for thanksgiving...they were delicious..made fresh, wrapped perfectly, and tasted amazing !  Tony is not only a great cook, he is a great guy also...stop in and say hi and order a little something...you won't be disappointed
