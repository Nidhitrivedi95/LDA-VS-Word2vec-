wT-J6sib_NSr8rcH2aTcAA I have never had a problem with an order here though they do tend to kind of over cook or burn their meat but for me that's not a problem because I've always kind of preferred it that way. It's a small place not a lot of seating but the service is great they always get everything right and it doesn't matter how much I mess with my order and change it every which way they always get it right! I am a regular here and I will remain a regular!
