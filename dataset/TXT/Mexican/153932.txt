K-uQkfSUTwu5LIwPB4b_vg Three stars because the food is AMAZING but the experience... Meh. 

It starts off by us calling to see the wait. We are immediately put on hold for almost 4 minutes. The waits about 45 minutes which considering it's a Saturday in old town when all the snowbirds are coming back its not bad. We get there and are told at worst an hour... Totally fine. Until they never put our name in the system. 

My fiancé goes up after quite awhile to ask how close we are to being sat when the hostess shuffles papers and then says we can just be sat right now. Which is nice except the couple that just walked in an hour after us is being told the same exact thing. We could have sat much sooner. 

Then we get sat in the bar at a corner table where my fiancé is getting bumped into by the waitress, the guacamole table and other guests. 

I order a Diet Coke and my fiancé gets a gin and tonic. My Diet Coke is forgotten and we had to ask the food runner for it 10 minutes later. 

We had the wings and street corn for an appetizer both of which were incredible but then we finished and waited 25 more minutes for our actual meal. On top of that our table was so small it almost didn't fit what we ordered. 

Again the food really is so good. It's worth the long wait (if they don't forget to put you on the actual list), but when we spend over $100 on a meal for two we would hope for a much better experience.
