mFGUvyJSdSRjIaN94QW_IQ Food was great. Service was great. Cute and clean on the inside. I had the pollo fundido and he had the chimi enchilada style. Chips and salsa were good. I really enjoyed my lunch. Their website lists 2 locations however the BOGO coupon I brought was only good at the 43rd St location per the manager. She said we could have 50% off one entrée.  I thought that was ridiculous but didn't feel like arguing.  Not the best deal in town for a Mexican lunch but it could have stayed on my "safe bet" list if it hadn't been for that. I probably won't be back...I feel the managers decision was tacky and it cost them a customer. There are so many choices for Mexican in Phoenix.  I use the Entertainment Guide as a compass kind of. I have a hard time trying new places unless it's a great deal. Rarely does this happen with those coupons but when it does, I am instantly turned off. Glad she gave me the 50% because it would have been $30 for 2 basic Mexican lunches. That's too much in my opinion.  If I wanna pay $15 per plate I go to Blue Agave in Scottsdale or some place like that.
