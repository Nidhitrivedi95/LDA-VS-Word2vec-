I had the cheese enchiladas and the "red" sauce I thought they would come with was instead very nearly brown and was not appealing to me. That coupled with the very brown, slightly hard rice and clumped beans, covered in cheese that wasn't even warm because it sat too long before I received it (and therefore was clumped cheese as well). I was not happy at all with my meal choice but I was with our office staff and so I did not make a big deal, I just ate what I could. I ordered the Mexican flag (guac, pico and sour cream) and that came on lettuce so I scraped all the sauce off one enchilada and tried to make it a salad. Yeah, whatever. The rest of my tummy I filled with water. Needless to say, I felt gross when I left (lol). The chips and salsa served as appetizers were not bad but it was too salty for my taste. The pico appeared and tasted very fresh. A few members of our table ordered the side salad and that also appeared fresh and I was totally jealous I did not order one. A couple other members of the table had chicken fajitas and they appeared very appetizing. Each of them said they were happy with their choice. So, guess it was just me and my stupid attraction to enchiladas that got me in trouble here. Haha.
