19S0gFtg5GTX6CkiApJiAQ I love trying new taco places and this one has to be one of my favorites including with Taco Y Taco. 
My visit was quick but it was good giving me a lasting impression. Ordered a strawberry mango fresco with three mini tacos of al pastor, cabeza and lengua which I abosolutely love. And just with three mini tacos , I'm already full. The flavors were amazing unless I haven't had tacos in a while but there salsa verde had a really good kick to it too. The texture of the lengua and cabeza were and always will be my favorite. Definitely recommended. The place is quaint it's in the corner of Antelope and Charleston so super convenient if you go to school as the West Charleston campus of College of Southern Nevada. Though I am upset that they're not open late enough but much respected because I wouldn't want to work past 9p or 10p either . The only thing I haven't seen it busy so I can't give any tips for their rush hour but I did enjoy the space they had on a slow time after class. Again, check them out! I look forward in trying the rest of their menu and drink options !
