vUYz-JgVTAtUGUbQuF7czw I hardly write reviews but I just wanted to take the time to acknowledge Silvia. She was working the drive thru. She was very nice and her smile and politeness really brightened my day. I really appreciate people who take the time to be genuinely nice and I wanted to recognize that. Thank you Silvia for being so kind and happy!
