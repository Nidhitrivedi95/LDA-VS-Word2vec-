WGFJbxzhO44Ku05BM1hDjA This is our new favorite Mexican restaurant. Very family friendly and the food is unbelievable. We recently went back in for our 1 year olds birthday and it could not have been a better experience. Our server Mr. Diamond was one of the best we've ever had. The entire staff was friendly and engaging and treated our kids like they were their own.  I would say with much confidence that this is the best Mexican restaurant in the entire Akron area.
