Oto60yDwk1z72WmfWEYrjg Great food. Great service. Lose served us and was great. One of the restaurants at the hotel without smoke from the casino. Yay!!!

Love Mexican food as long as it's not spicy with peppers. I know, it's an oxymoron  What can I say?  But they prepared my food just the way I like it. 

Even the manger stopped by our table to check on our large group. They gave us separate checks without a problem. All the staff was friendly and patient with us.
