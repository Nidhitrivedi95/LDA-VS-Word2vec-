_OoQ31fIoy3dK96rP6vtFQ Friend and I had lunch there. It was busy, and no wonder. The service was quick and efficient. The menu varied and fairly priced. We had a coupon for buy one meal, get one meal 50% off. The food was well prepared. Arrived quickly. Service was on fleek.

The only ding I could think of about this place is they serve Pepsi products. I mean, no restaurant ever apologizes for having Coke products, could you imagine? "I'm sorry sir we only have coke, would that be ok?"

Anyways good food, good service, clean, and fairly priced.
