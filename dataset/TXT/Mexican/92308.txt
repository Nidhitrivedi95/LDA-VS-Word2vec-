e13SEvJud_vgeDR_doL4sQ Extra star given for the many vegan menu options. My vegan companion was able to order the vegan chile relleno.  I had a taco plate and it was okay. We stopped by for dinner before a show last weekend at The House of Blues- venue is just a hop down the escalator. Very convenient. I had a Blackberry Splash to drink- muddled blueberry, tequila, and ginger liqeuor- very refreshing.
