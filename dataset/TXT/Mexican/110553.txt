FxEJjLZj6UdsOCGcgEufeA Okay, I just stopped in for my first time last Friday morning. Boy, are they nice! I just wanted a cochito, but I decided to try a couple of my other favorites as well.  Here we go.
The crust on the empanadas was incredibly flaky and tender. The cream cheese filling is to die for!
Here are the bummers.
1. I tasted no molasses at all in my Cochito-although the texture and freshness was awesome.
2. The pumpkin empanada was horrible. The filling was bland, and the crust was- I don't know- bread?!? YUK. Gross.  Sadly, it is one of my favorite empanadas, but never again here¡
I will go again, but I'm not raving.
Edit:
Later on, I had a funny taste in my mouth.  i realized that the reason the crust was so tender and flaky was that they used a LOT of shortning!!
I think I prefer the harder crusts of the Food City and La Tolteca type of empanadas.  I can't fault the flavor of that filling though!!!
I will still go back.
