vW4aHXGRfkrsaNdNUuE1RQ We just found our favorite New Mexican food. I had the flautas and they where amazing. We will be coming back here for sure. Everything is new inside and booths are super comfortable. The service was great also. My husband had the flank steak and it was also amazing. I will mention that the food is not over spicy but that's how I like it I am sure if you requested it hot they would accommodate  you. Don't forget to have the flan for dessert it is delicious!!
