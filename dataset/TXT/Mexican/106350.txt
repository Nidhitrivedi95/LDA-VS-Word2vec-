fkXwJHETFfJUc-gu-pyeLw I don't know what it is but this Chipotle is very consistent with their taste... It always tastes good!! I usually order the steak and out of all the Chipotles I have been to, it is very rare for me to get a steak burrito with a ton of fat pieces unlike the Chipotle in Parma where every bite was more of a bite of steak fat rather than any lean meat.. The only reason why I gave this place a 3 star rating is because their bathroom is never as consistent as their food... Sometimes it makes me think twice about eating here because their bathroom is constantly dirty.. But since the food is always good, I usually just ignore the dirty facility... I just hope and pray that their cooking utensils don't match it.. Anywho! I would highly recommend this Chipotle for great consistency of their taste! Ahh-mayyyy-zing!
