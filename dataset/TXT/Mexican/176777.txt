MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA Was disappointed with the food, but I really wanted to love it. 

Went there last Friday night with a girlfriend, got there just after 6:30 pm. We put our name on the list and got a call nearly an hour later; we waited at a nearby bar and couldn't hear my phone (they called twice) but the hostess was gracious enough to take us in when we finally responded. Points for that!

Tiny place, no wonder there is always a line-up. Nice ambiance though, enjoyed it.

Menus are on the walls. It's kind of dark inside, luckily we were close to the food menu (which was the important one) otherwise they are hard to read. Margarita's were great. We ordered the guac and salsa (pretty good) and the fish ceviche (too much mayo, the chunks were too big and mushy - definitely not for everyone). The beef cheek tacos were only OK (La Carnita is way better), the fish tacos were also alright.

I just wasn't blown away, maybe it was all the hype. I really wanted to love their food but other Mexican places have delivered better.
