P8IsTiHq5Hesa6UPL604ww This place has excellent food...that is if they give you what you ordered. A couple people who work there, especially the curly haired girl, have bad attitudes that make you feel like your order is a burden to them and shouldnt be working in the service indsutry. I live a couple miles away and religiously stopped on Taco Tuesday for takeout tacos. The first time they screwed up my order, I considered it a small mistake. After the 4th time they gave me the wrong thing, I called them to express my dissatisfaction with their inconsistency. They offered to give me a credit for my order and told me to just mention my name when I came in the next time. When I went back in, they said that I had to have the receipt and that they don't just take names. They finally reluctantly agreed to give it to me, but I know that I will NEVER be coming back! I can find plenty of other taco places with better attitudes and less screwups!
