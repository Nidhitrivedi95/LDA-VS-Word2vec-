Ns20WGWn6s6niKAGIQB4UQ Hey Hey Hey AZ it's Analynn ... If you are ever downtown Phoenix make sure you hit the Crescent Ballroom ! I gave this hidden gem five stars! With amazing live entertainment , hipster vibe and deliciously fresh homemade food and taco 's . Featured headlining band last night was Royal Tides(R/T) !!! Thanks to all the bands for a great evening ! If you go I hope you enjoy it as much as I did .
