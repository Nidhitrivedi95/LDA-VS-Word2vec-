as_fyujgsdwtV56n31z-Sw Excellent food and atmosphere. The fish tacos are great and plantain chips. A little pricey $3-4 for a taco that is eaten in 3 bites. The decor and layout are cute and different from other places on the westside. Only thing holding this place back is service! Many servers are obviously new and starting out. The reason there is always a line is bc it takes them 2.5 hours to turn a table. Ours seat us then come back for drink orders 20 min later the food orders 20 min after that. I think when that's fixed it'll be a great place.
