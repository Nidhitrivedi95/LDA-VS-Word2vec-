utqMwgvfYPlWMaRkX09w1g When we pulled up, we groaned-not much curb appeal & we were skeptical. Friendly greeting-we were the only customers. The iced tea & guacamole were freshly made. A mahi mahi bowl & the carne asada bowl were recommended & did not disappoint-delish! She brought hot, medium & mild salsa's & they all had good flavor. Oh, & pica digallo was a perfect accompaniment. I'll be back for more!
