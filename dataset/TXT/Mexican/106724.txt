FMo1PJTUV5OpyiZlnTM1Rg Sharky's is a new Woodfired Mexican Grill that opened up a few months ago in west Las Vegas. This place is great for good clean food. They use all fresh ingredients including organic local greens, wild caught fish, all natural beef and chicken with no antibiotics or hormones. Non GMO corn and oil. Organic beans, rice, quinoa and tofu. Everything is good you really can taste the difference. The only problem is I don't think a lot of people know about this place. Most of the people I talk to have never heard of them and don't know that they are there. Hopefully the word gets out and they get busier soon. It would be a shame if they closed down due to lack of customers. Maybe a few months of heavy radio advertising would help spread the word. Anyway the food is good and healthy, you guys should try it!  Adios
