NOa2huwFeKWz2TP-sjhZhA No Bueno. Found this on Uber eats and decided to give it a shot. Very disappointed. 

 Tried the tacos, enchiladas, ceviche tostada and Asada cheese fries. Took a few pictures of the poor quality. The meat was either too greasy or dry. The ceviche tostada was bland and my tostada shell reminded me of an air popped corn chip! Not happy with the quality. Won't be coming back :(
