woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ The food is very good, however I was really upset with the staff. The hostess was rude and made me sit at the bar because I was alone instead of a table like I wanted. The bar tender made several mistakes with food and kept asking what people ordered. The kitchen staff are having more fun with each other than focusing on producing food for customers. 

I would have given them 5 stars, but too many staff mistakes. I loved the food, but I believe in being treated with respect and customer appreciation so I will not return or recommend this place.
