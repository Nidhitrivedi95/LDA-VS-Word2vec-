e4NQLZynhSmvwl38hC4m-A I was in the Mesa area and stumbled upon this place on Yelp with over 600 reviews. There was ample parking when we got there around 2 pm on a Saturday. There was a line but it moved fairly quick. Wow. The tacos here are amazing. I've been to Moreno's and other taco shops and this place wins hands down. Make sure you request grilled onions which is free. You will not be disappointed!
