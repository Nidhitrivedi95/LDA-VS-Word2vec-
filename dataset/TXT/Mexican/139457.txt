J0X8w6E0EHZ0rL5D55pbHA Came here because of good reviews and was EXTREMELY dissatisfied.  I paid $12 for a carne asada combination plate and the meat resembles dog food.  I admit the salsa is ok but a burrito from a gas station would have been about as satisfying as this meal.  There are much better options in the area than this!
