Chandler location only. Avoid this hot mess of a restaurant. 
- Called in a catering order at 2pm for next day delivery at noon. Employee on phone said "I don't know enough about catering, I'll have a manager call you in 20-30 minutes". Okay. 
- Received call back from Manager (Julie) at 8pm.
She informs me that she is very busy with catering the following day,and requested my time slot be pushed back 15-20 minutes. Okay. Julie also kept me on the phone rambling about what items I should order to best feed the 10 people, yet could not provide pricing, as I tried to pay then. Hmm. 
- Received TEXT from Julie the following morning saying she needed me to text my CC information! Again, no balance given. I told her she could call me at her earliest convenience and I would provide payment. 
- Received another TEXT from Julie at 11:30am stating she's not sending the driver without payment. That's fine, but CALL ME. Or, answer your phone like a professional. My receipt has a time stamp of 12:12, the time my order was to be delivered to East Mesa (from Ahwatukee). Clearly, they were still twiddling their thumbs at this time. 
- Driver showed to my event/lunch just after 1:15 pm. Completely ruined my agenda and essentially it was a wash of a luncheon. 
- Oh, the best part was my bill: $197 ...for 10 people. Basically, Julie charges whatever TF she wants and you're stuck with the surprise. 
$6.00 extra lettuce (small bowl of grass = 6 bucks )
$25 "Open Food" charge (how sad that the delivery boy didn't even light our wicks to keep the food warm) 
$25 delivery charge. Food set up over an hour late and incomplete. 
- Called Julie and she did nothing but give excuses. One being, "I'm sorry it was late we had the Health Dept here". 
- Called Julie's "boss" (a franchisee advice-giver) who blew smoke and didn't make anything right. 
Oh, another fun fact, he filled me in as to why the Health Dept. was there that morning.....THEY DID NOT HAVE RUNNING HOT WATER. 
This happened on 2/23/17 so y'all know I'm not raging mad anymore. :) :) :) These are facts. 
Good luck, Julie!
