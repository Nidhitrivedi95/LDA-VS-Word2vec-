moZpwq1hNxC-uJRpfupOTA Definitely have had better!  Arizona is probably one of the few states that you can find AMAZING Mexican food and this place is NOT ONE OF THEM. 

The actual restaurant was adorable and had a great outdoor patio. The margaritas were good but nothing special and my meal (Blue Enchiladas) were just alright.  Any Mexican restaurant that doesn't start out with complimentary chips and salsa is just LAME to me.
