xw6G0T2VQZAtta6RcZoAOQ I've visited Cafe Rio before, but this Cafe Rio must be, by far, one of the worst when it comes to customer service. Bad enough to force me to create a Yelp account, and provide a negative review. I visited this location with my friends and when we started ordering, right off the bat, the service was slow and shitty. The employees seemed very unhappy, and hostile, towards the customer. It made me feel uncomfortable and not want to order, but giving that my friends and I had already spend 30 minutes in line, I was not about to just walk away. While ordering the new employees had no idea what was going on, like even the names of the meat. I don't blame the new employees for not knowing because they were new, but the older employees were completely useless and unwilling to provide help or guidance, awkward. As I was ordering extra cheese, or a different cheese, and the new employee was ready to get it for me, the older employee asked very rudely, "is he going to pay extra?!?!" And it was just very rude and could have been asked completely differently. 

The food was okay. I have nothing to say about the taste, because they obviously used the same ingredients. However, the customer service did ruin my experience there. I hope management does something about the hostile customer service this location is providing.
