iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg Been here on two occasions and I can't say enough good things about the mahi mahi and Al pastor tacos. The meat is nicely seasoned and almost melts in your mouth. At first you're annoyed because this place only takes cash and there's no friggin place to sit. But once you manage to score an empty bench (or an actual seat) - all annoyances are gone and the tacos are like envelopes of love from your favourite grandma (minus the cash and grandma). Tacos are packed and overflowing, so you might wanna grab a fork or two before you chow down
