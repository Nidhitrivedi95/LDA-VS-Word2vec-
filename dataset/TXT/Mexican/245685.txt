TRRmgX8mySv_y-DOkTZTFQ Really liked this place. The menu was very unique (which can go either way depending on what you're in the mood for) and the food was delicious. The service was also great (the manager waited on us). My only caveat is that they don't have hard shell tacos. That may sound silly but that's all I wanted that night and they didn't have any! Good margarita selection. Also loved the fried ice cream.
