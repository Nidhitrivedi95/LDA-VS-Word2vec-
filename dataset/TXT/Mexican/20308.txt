1ZJz840L496LAmQdeDv0WA Located in Container Park, it's the Mexican food option if you have hang out in the Park...

Service: They have some friendly people working the counter and the grill.  They bring your order out to you if you're sitting outside which you most likely will as the seating inside is limited.  They do get the food out in a timely manner which I appreciate.

Food: The 3 taco plates comes to you served on a 3 section styrofoam plate along with rice, beans and some tortilla chips.  The tacos were made with fresh ingredients but unfortunately tasted very bland and lacked flavor.  The beans and rice quality was something you can purchase at your local grocery store.  I think they can do better.  The blood orange margarita was decent and and served in a plastic cup out of a soft drink machine dispenser.  I thought they got my drink order wrong and I was served an orange soda, but all was well.

Value: The 3 Taco plate was about $10 and the Blood Orange Margarita was $8.  I understand there's a premium for the location but the quality of food is lacking even for the premium location.  

I like sitting outside in Container Park on a nice days with the crew and would love nothing more than to enjoy that time with good Mexican food.  I'm going to give them another chance because the staff is great and I'll hit up the nachos or burritos next time.  Update coming sooner versus later as I love Container Park and the Downtown area.
