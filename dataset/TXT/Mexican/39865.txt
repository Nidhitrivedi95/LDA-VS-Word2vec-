6LVadHqqjWlVnd-T7gAZyA I would put Garcia's about one-and-a-half steps above fast food. Overall food quality is seriously lacking for a sit-down, more expensive-type restaurant.  The value isn't there, as most all of the food seems like frozen, pre-packaged food you could buy at a Costco or the grocery store.  I'm not sure whether that is a problem with all Garcia's, or whether this particular location simply isn't making the grade. 

The most recent time we came here, I ordered the chile verde burrito, with beans on the side.  Mind you this was an $11+ burrito, and when it came out, it only had about four or five pieces of meat in it.  The rest was a huge tortilla folded over and over again on itself.  No value there whatsoever. And it actually didn't taste that good. Note this is not a fluke as I've ordered this on at least one other occasion and it was the same way. 

It was the same for the other food - none of it seemed freshly prepared in any way. All of it had the look of frozen processed food, that was simply warmed up in a microwave, oven, or deep fryer.  The chimichangas were all "perfect" and had a processed meat sauce. The burritos were clearly frozen burritos by their shape and folding. 

Overall, there are much better places you can visit for the price you would pay here. Maybe at one time this place was good, but it isn't anymore. Look elsewhere for authentic Mexican food that actually tastes good!
