yg_oK5Luqh-VbsF0RK1teQ First and last visit!   No one spoke when I walked in. The bathroom had no soap or towels. When I ordered food and paid no thanks or have a good day.  I sat and watched other people come and go the employees never smiled.  Very depressing experience and sanitary code was low.  I would never go back to this location.  Sad because this is a very busy and growing area.  They could make a fortune here!!!
