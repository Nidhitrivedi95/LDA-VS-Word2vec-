HWl2EbZhkhAkFgqt44yUkA I like coming to Senor Frog's because it's convenient when I'm staying at TI and they always offer coupons from websites that provide nice discounts which means more money in my pocket! I stick with my dry rub chicken wings ALL THE TIME because I like chicken wings and they don't disappoint! The décor is awesome and super funny - just look up at the ceiling! They have different things going on all throughout the day/night from raffles (won a Cancun trip during a raffle!), balloons, pictures with Senor Frog! and all this other fun stuff. You can sit inside or outside and they have specials all day/night long. This place is super fun and the food isn't too bad. It's a decent spot to just chill and eat while you recharge for your next Vegas activity!
