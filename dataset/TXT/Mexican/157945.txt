knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw Tried it again, really, this is what visitors to our town experience on 4th street, something needs to put in its place before the RNC. Poor service and the food is not quality, drinks are very expensive for what you get.  Awesome location.This is  the last visit and last review. I am in a position to refer restaurants to out of town visitors several times a week  and thought I would give it a fair shot again, no more done very disappointed.
