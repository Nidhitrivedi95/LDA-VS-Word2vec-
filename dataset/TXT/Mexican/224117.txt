RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg Mmmhmm one of the best and quick spots to pick up tacos after clubbing!! They tasted pretty good! We ordered around 30 tacos and their service was rather quick. Once you enter, there are three different lines that you can go to and order depending on what you want. I tried the carne asada and the spicy pork (these are a must try if you are here!!!) I definitely enjoyed and recommend the carne asada!! They were flavorful and delicious! On another note, the tacos are small and I would recommend ordering at least 4!
