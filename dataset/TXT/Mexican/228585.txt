SAae44V24aD7y_HpgxjhPA I like to eat at Nando's every once in awhile. We were near by so this was our choice. The wait was about 15 minutes, less than they stated. We had margaritas to start. I don't like most margaritas when eating out but these are not so sweet. I had the Seafood Relleno that was delicious. They have a ranchero sauce that's over it, not heavy, very good. They give you an abundance beans and rice and unfortunately I ate all of it. It was very good, the beans tasted housemade. My husband had the chimichanga and it was huge and he said good. My granddaughter had the beef fajitas, good and enough for both of them to bring some home. I recommending giving Nando's a try. More than enough to eat.
