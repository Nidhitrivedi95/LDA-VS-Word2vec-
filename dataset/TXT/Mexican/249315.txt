ufwkkMd9yr9cFU1R5ONArg Update: so I've been thinking about how great breakfast was for literally two weeks, so I made the drive into Etobicoke again today. I was not disappointed. The Mexican eggs Benny is seriously OUT OF THIS WORLD! I had every intention of trying something new, but why fix what's not broken, am I right? Thank you for filling my belly with such yumminess. And for the amazing churros. Oh my, soooo good. This place, the vibe, the food, it all makes me happy. 


Oh.My.Huevos!! 
Drove from Oakville to eat here on the recommendation of a friend. I was definitely impressed and will return (soon). Ordered the Mexican Eggs Benny, I only ever order Eggs Benny, so I know a good one when I eat it, and let me just say, I WILL ONLY EVER EAT THEM HERE from now on. They were by far THEE BEST I have ever had! The homemade guac was killer, the chorizo was incredible and the hollandaise sauce was spot on. Half/half of salad and home fries was the perfect amount of all things yummy. 
SERIOUSLY AMAZING. Everyone else enjoyed their meals thoroughly also...Mexican breakfast & breakfast burrito. 
Can't wait to come back.... Maybe tomorrow?
