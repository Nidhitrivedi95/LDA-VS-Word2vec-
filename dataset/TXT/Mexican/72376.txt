cChJhpiljARaINk-dyXGiQ This is a family favorite- we have been here often since it opened.  My favorite dish is the carne asada tacos, but everything I've tried has been great.  My son is a fan of the Taquitos Mexicanos, and my husband loves every shrimp dish they have.  The service is fantastic, and we love that it is BYOB.
