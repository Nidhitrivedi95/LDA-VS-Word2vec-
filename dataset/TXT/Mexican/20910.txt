2EseSYpIwW6JaA0wUojd4Q Service was good, appetizer, empanada, were good, but the main course, the daily special of endless enchiladas was terrible, canned mushrooms, beef ones tasted like hot dog chili, chicken wasn't consistent one bite would be hot and the next not have any flavor, am not coming back here
