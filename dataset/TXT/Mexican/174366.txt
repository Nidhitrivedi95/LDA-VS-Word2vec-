MmQsPiVSN08WtmlsC_ZSVA Drove by today and thought what a great idea tacos for lunch!!  I'm severely disappointed (not about price I'm ok with paying money for good food) for about $9 you get a taco aside I took the empanada some chips and some salsa. The taco had very little Cotija cheese... some will flavored chicken and less than a tablespoon of guacamole.
The line took about ten minutes..  not a big deal. But the food was cold, my taco literally looked like someone had eaten half the chicken out of it

I'm really disappointed for almost $10 for a lunch meal I really expected better.
