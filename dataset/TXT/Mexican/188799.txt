OA5Li3ySzhrbG_WvD_QGYA This place is so good! We're not from here and I'm truly going to miss it once we leave. However if you get the frozen margarita you won't taste the liquor, so definitely get on the rocks. The patio is gorgeous and the food is delicious and I highly recommend it! Try the chorizo, the Greek goddess shell, and the cilantro lime aioli sauce!!! Did I mention it's only $3 a taco
