j-5O-Ehd2eaCHYgmTSfoRw Great CHEAP date idea- my husband and I like to go to Chipotle and walk around downtown afterwards. The service in this particular chain is extremely friendly every time we go. They keep the place clean and moving quickly. If you're gluten free, you're in luck- everything is gluten free but the flour tortillas. The chips are corn.
