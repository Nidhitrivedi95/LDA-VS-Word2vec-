The bad: I was not impressed with the carnitas street tacos. They came with no salsa and were bland. I asked for some salsa verde and was given two small containers (each about the size of a medicine cup from the Nyquil bottle) of good salsa (for which they charged me several dollars)... The accompanying rice was overcooked and the beans were tasteless and bland. 

Diners accompanying me raved about their sweet potato tacos. I might return and try those --as well as another cucumber jalapeno margarita.

If in the mood for street tacos and salsa at a fair price, I will probably head to Chipotle--right across the street.
