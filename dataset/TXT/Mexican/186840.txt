O_UC_izJXcAmkm6HlEyGSA The short rib tacos are the bomb diggity! Never knew you could put rib meat into tacos, but I'm glad they invented it. Perfectly sweet with a nice tangy finish. Rich and diverse. Excellent mouthfeel too - that short rib was tender and moist.

The fish tacos sucked though. It's a catch of the day dish, and today's was baja. We got grilled (as opposed to battered) at the recommendation of our server. It looked kinda bland, tasted bland (reminiscent of overlooked and browned scrambled eggs) and was soggy to the point where the soft tortilla fell apart in my hands and I had to eat the taco ashamedly with a fork and knife. Save your fish taco cravings for seven lives in Kensington.

The guac and chips appetizer was real nice. The guac comes in a nice stone mortar (great looking touch), and comes in three spicy levels: mild medium spicy. The spicy level has the perfect kick to it - spicy, but not overbearing. The chips are homemade and fried - hint of egg, and real tasty, although some -very few- were a bit too oily).

A friend's recommended the Mexican iced tea. Apparently delicious and strong. Gonna have to get next time.
