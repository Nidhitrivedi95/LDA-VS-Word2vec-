F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw Me and the BF had date night at Momocho and it was great! I'm a big fan of Mexican food so I was really excited to try it out. The inside is like creepy mexican decorations mixed with Mexican wrestling decorations. It's dark and intimate (seriously it's pretty small, but not crowded/cramped, it's perfect)

They have a huge variety of guacamole. I'm not a big guac fan (gasp! I know, I'm a freak) but I loved Momocho guac, so they must be doing something right! I also got a margarita and I asked them to mix the pineapple and pomegranate flavors, which they were happy to do and it was delicious. My BF got the cucumber margarita (I think it's their signature drink) and it was so refreshing! I could def sip on that in the summer!

I got the little pescado tacos (sorry I forget their real name). I thought they were really light but still filling, which is what I was hoping for and it was great. I nibbled on what my BF got, but I forget what that was called too. However, since both were so tasty, I think it's safe to say that Momocho just always makes delicioso food!

I'll definitely go back and I can't wait until I do! (Hopefully I'll remember a little more to include in my review that time around...)

Make sure you make a reservation like a day in advance because, like I said, it's really small and tasty.
