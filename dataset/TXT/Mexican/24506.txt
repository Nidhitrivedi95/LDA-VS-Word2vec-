2XaCV8VwXuJAmyqif0_RVA We do not live in this area but we're out at the Veterans Hospital on Saturday (8/12). After leaving the hospital, we were looking for a place to eat near by the hospital without driving all over the Valley.
I looked on Yelp and found La Familia Authentic Mexican Food. To be honest, we didn't really know what to expect. We found the location very quickly. It's nothing "fancy". However the staff was very friendly. Brought out chips & salsa. I had the taco special with carnitas, included rice & beans. Very tender, spices just right. My husband had the carnitas burrito. We both had sodas, it was less than $20. Unfortunately, we are often at the VA Hospital....but we're glad we found La Familia, we will return!
