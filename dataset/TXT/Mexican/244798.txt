tLqhkS7Y8oTeFeweCycbIA I usually like most items I try on the menu here; especially the vegan options although I can't say the same for beef shawarma. The chunks were too thick and the meat was far from tender. It was a little too chewy. The hummus underneath was to die for. The traditional tea had a very strong chlorine smell, it would have been way more delicious if they have used filtered water. The place is packed during lunch hours, the service is usually quick and efficient. The portions are enormous so they are easily shareable between two people.
