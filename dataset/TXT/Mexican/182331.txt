NHFsXnwZDkY3ufoTE9iKjQ Waited in the car 30 minutes for them to open up. I was the second customer. The dude ahead of me ordered 2 bowls with brown rice. My turn comes and I order the same thing. There was only one scoop of rice that didn't even coat the bottom of my bowl. Meanwhile, the assistant helping the dude before me had a difficult time getting his bowls closed and mine had a lot of empty space. 
I used to work in customer service and I'm big on tipping. It does not shame me to say, I left no tip! 
If I could give a ZERO, I dare not, I'd leave a NEGATIVE.
