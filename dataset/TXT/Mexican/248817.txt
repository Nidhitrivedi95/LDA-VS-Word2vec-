uBRmZ_h7WP8xesuYqZTFbA First time here.  Had the enchiladas Verdes. Absolutely delicious!The portion was huge I had a hard time finishing it. Chips and salsa were ok typical of what I'd had at most places. My boyfriend had the Vallarta special also very good and super gigantic. Service was great and super fast. Will definitely stop again if I'm out this way
