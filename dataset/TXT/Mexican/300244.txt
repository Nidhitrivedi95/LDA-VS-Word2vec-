zMfZLd5_h5W8ZVxTNoeJyQ In general, meh.  The Mexican fare is average at best, and if it wasn't for the lure of the gimmicky yet pretty tasty "Yinzeritas" I'm not sure I would even give the place 3 stars.  It's decent enough for a happy hour when you're getting drinks and chips and dip, or even just to get drinks, but I wouldn't recommend the place if you're looking for a great Mexican dining experience, or great dining experience in general.
