VBVqHnViRLSYAqP7v8iNNQ I really like it here. So surprised by all the bad reviews. I've come here frequently over the years and find the service to be consistently good and the food to be very good too. I tend to order the same things most of the time, but that's because I love them! The 'Boss' margarita is great. The chips and salsa are great. I have no complaints and am always happy to come here for dinner.
