1VHNeig1A12AaJKEKRI7Uw Came in today to kill time while my car was being washed. There was a guy at the counter. I didn't get his name but he was very friendly. I tried the strawberries and bananas with cream. Omg they tasted like heaven. Soooo yummy!!! The cream they use has cinnamon mixed in and made it taste even better. I'll be back soon.
