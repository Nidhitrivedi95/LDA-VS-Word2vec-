oN_A87dyVD2FBk7coLnhCg writing this review for anyone who might be wary about the food offerings inside a gas station: fear not, Chili Verde is great! cheap, fresh, non-greasy Mexican food that beats anything I've ever gotten at Roberto's. Carlos is the guy who always makes my order and he's fast, polite, and a wizard on the plancha. 

kinda sucks that they're only open til 8pm (6p on Sat/4pm Sun) 'cuz everyone knows midnight is the best time to eat a taco. hopefully they are able to hire more staff and start serving more extended hours in the near future.
