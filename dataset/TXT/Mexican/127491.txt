HWl2EbZhkhAkFgqt44yUkA I had the Carne Asada and was disappointed. The Carne Asada was good just the portions are small. And it was a $30 meal without the drink. I don't think I will go to the Senor Frog....to much $ for the amount of food.. O and don't sit at the bar it is dirty. I don't think they clean the drink wells.... the catchup mustard and hot sauce they keep in them are all stuck in place ... Totally Gross...
