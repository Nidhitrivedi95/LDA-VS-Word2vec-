k-drEjxKmfqllwfY90STfA Very disappointing for a more upscale Mexican restaurant.  It's located in park road shopping center.  There is plenty of parking available.  Chips and salsa were tasty however, the queso dip was a disappointment.  How do you mess up melted cheese.  There was absolutely nothing great about the food.  It was so disappointing I can't even remember which kind of tacos I ordered.  The rice was inedible.  

It is a large restaurant with plenty of outdoor seating on the front patio.  A great view of the parking lot ;) 

I will not be returning to this restaurant.  There's tons of Mexican restaurants to choose from in Charlotte and this one does not make the cut.
