Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ One of the best experiences my wife and I had in Vegas. Ambience of the restaurant was incredible. The staff was amazing, attentive and so professional. Our meals were outstanding. I had Carne Asada while my wife had a trio of seafood enchiladas. I would definitely recommend both to anyone. 

Having said this, The icing on the cake for me was the gentleman's restroom attendant. I cannot remember his name; however, he noticeably took pride in what he did. He provided a service that I believe is under appreciated. Soap in my hand, turning the water on for me, and having a towel ready to dry my hands. I know it sounds weird, but it made the experience that much better. My wife and I go to Vegas to "treat ourselves" to the luxuries we don't experience in our everyday lives raising three kids. This restaurant gave us that experience. 

We come to Vegas every year and have dined all over the strip. Javier's is now at the top of our list and we cannot wait to return next year.
