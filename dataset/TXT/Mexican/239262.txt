t2eQcHc7WIlyKK8zFtY2Kw I have a slight obsession with Quesada bowls. Like, I go here about 3-4 of my 5 day work week. Its MUCH cheaper than chipotle and I get way more. My only gripe would be to have a better hot sauce and salsa bar. There isn't enough heat difference between them nor a whole lot of flavour and for someone that has taste buds that were developed outside of Canada, I would really appreciate more attention here. The owner lady (i think...) that rings you up is insanely friendly.
