I went over for dinner around 6pm on a Friday night...the parking lot was packed.  I walked in and placed my order.   I started to look around and there were like 7 different clusters of people.....it seemed like some poor man's group therapy deal where a bunch of wackos met on Meet-Up.  Wackos can be cool but wth are they doing taking up the space in the restaurant?  Also, usually I have lunch and not dinner.  1000% different.  At dinner all the table were dirty and the place looked pretty bad.  Maybe they were waiting for the group therapy session to clear out.  But, the lunch crew runs a tight ship.  Kick out the weirdos and give me the lunch crew and I give this place 4 stars.
