SW6ZQk22G1_CV81_gfnvNQ La Carnita is a very very busy place. If you don't make reservations for a large group on a Friday or Saturday night (or afternoon), then come back the following week with a reservation.

I find the tacos to be a bit small, but all in all very flavourful with all the ingredients topped high. It may cause for a few messy bites, so ensure you have a few extra napkins nearby. 

I have had the In Cod We Trust taco. The fried piece of fish seems to be disproportionate to the size of the taco. The fish is fried well with the right hint of lime crema (the sour note).

The Carnita taco was not my favourite as the ingredients are a bit dry. The pork itself is dry, but seasoned well.

I come here every time for the mexican street corn. Two pieces for $9 topped with chilli powder mayo. If you don't like the extra kick of the chilli powder you can definitely ask to omit the powder as it is sprinkled on top of the mayo. The corn is charred to perfection. This gets a bit messy to eat, but is very  very enjoyable! If you stick to the basics, who doesn't like corn and mayo?
