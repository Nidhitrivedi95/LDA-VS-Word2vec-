ZB6Tvc8rhTbWvniKRpe9Fg It must have been an off night the night we went.  It was really busy and we were a very large group of people with obnoxious children.

I love Macayo's so much.  Well I love their Crispy Chicken Tacos so much.    I don't even look at the menu when I'm here.

I got the tacos and they were not hot.  They were still good but they obviously had been sitting on the counter for a while.  

My husband's Chimichanga wasn't crispy either.  It had been sitting for a minute too.

The kids meals, the kids had came with dessert and the waitress forgot them.

I still love their Chicken Taco's though.  I'll always come back.

Also, they need to get rid of the fountain in the front.  Either fix it so it has flowing water and no fish or just get rid of it all together.  It really smells like stagnant water.  Its really unappetizing when you walk in.
