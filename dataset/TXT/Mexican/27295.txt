3FnTXbcCXeZsbiXBW5OCYA Food is really good and the price for the food is great. The only downside was that there was no beer and certain things from the menu wasn't available. Also the refried beans are a little watery, and the only drinks they had was coke sprite and water. Still enjoyed the place. It was a little chilly in the restaurant.
