E_DXCeVllZtHV93hsAIZvw Bar none, Tacos Sahuaro has the most authentic Mexican tacos I have ever eaten in the states, and I cannot get enough of them!!

Everything about the food and experience at Tacos Sahuaro reminds me of when I go to the family taquerias in Mexico.  When you go in, you order with the cashier by picking your meats and what you want it in (tacos, quesadilla, torta, etc).  You then pick a seat, and a server will bring you a dish of cucumbers, radishes and limes along with 2 salsas and a homemade chili oil to munch on until your food comes out (which is never long).  And let me tell you, everything is lick your lips, kiss the air, and squeal with delight flavorful and delicious!!  My favorite 2 meats are the carne asada and the pastor.  I can't even describe how juicy and tasty they are....you just have to trust me.  Everything comes out piping hot with fresh onions and cilantro on top, and it is utter perfection.  And to note: I'm pretty sure they make their red salsa with spicy crack in it, because I sweat and need more of it every time I go ;)   

If you are looking for a true authentic taco experience, then you better run over to Tacos Sahuaro and get ready to chow down!
