Iw9k29FJCZ0fC68oxK1NtA When I say quick burrito, what comes to mind? did you say chipotle? Good, because Taco Tanto's shouldn't and not in a bad way. These aren't your normal conveyer belt ingredient choosing burritos. They're baked to gooey perfection, Taco Tanto's lays it on thick. 

The burritos are so good that I must admit, I haven't gotten past them on the menu. Luckily, It's a decently large menu ranging from starters to taco salads. The guacamole and salsa seems homemade, and is delicious. Topping it off with homemade medium and hot hot sauces, you can't go wrong.
