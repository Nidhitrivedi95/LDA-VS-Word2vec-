1JF9TbJ2d5hH8xsQvvklHg Best service ever. I showed up after they had closed and Irma was closing up and she was so upset she couldnt make me food that she invited me in for chips and salsa. My girlfriend and I were dumbfounded by what had happened. She was SO SWEET and genuine. With the incredible service and savory salsa I am definitely coming again. This is my first yelp review and it definitely deserves a 10/10.
