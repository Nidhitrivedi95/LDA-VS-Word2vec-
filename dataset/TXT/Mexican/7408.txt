_Kd0kQ8RF70hJ1ykLqCRyQ Warning- if you're vegan or lactose intolerant this location just dumps ingredients on your order without permission. I threw out my order after I found cheese in my vegan salad. They also wrapped up my boyfriends burrito before he could ask for anything other than rice and beans and poured enchilada sauce on it that he didn't want. I suggest going elsewhere if you have any food allergies or dietary restrictions.
