HpRj2Lv27EUQql0POE5sQw This Mexican restaurant is the only one in the Phoenix valley that has the authentic Mexican Jalisco taste. Like you are eating in my mommas kitchen and i am 100% mexican. My favorite is the Cocido de Res and the Chiles Rellenos. My husband loves the chicken fajitas. I love the corn tortillas they are made fresh to order and taste very good. The staff is very friendly. I always recommend this place to all my friends and family. Delicious Authentic Mexican Food!!!
