uKVWv1UGtBvwh7GYepIMmA It's about time I wrote a positive review for Lulu's Taco Shop, we've been eating here for years. It is a family favorite and a Gilbert staple.  The food is delicious! The tortillas are what make this dining experience unique: fresh, warm, and homemade.  You can't go wrong with ordering the AZ Burrito or even their simple Bean and Cheese Burrito.  Their food is always fresh and the environment is spotless.  And, the best part, you will actually meet the owners while you are dining in this mom-and-pop Mexican diner. Their salsa is absolutely amazing and my favorite is their Horchata--delicious.  This is by far one of the best Mexican restaurants in Arizona. Highly recommended.
