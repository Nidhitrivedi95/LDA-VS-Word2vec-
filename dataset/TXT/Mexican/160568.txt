KYdtom3RyDt-3SWGwmJcQA My usual place when I need a quick bit of Mexican food. This location is close to where I leave and pretty convenient. Their food is good, I don't know much about their entire menu since I tent to get always the same thing when I stop in. Service varies by staff member, some are great and are very helpful.
I've learned over the years what my favorites are and I am usually quick with my order, so it is a fast in an out for me. I like that they have free parking
