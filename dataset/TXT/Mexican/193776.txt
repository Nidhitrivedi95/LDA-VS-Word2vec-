OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ THE MOST AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD IN TOWN. 
Do not sleep on this spot, if you are ever in Vegas definitely stop by... I cant think of my favorite dish because you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu; The menudo The cocteles, The enchiladas. Mm everything is bomb! and always great customer service and very clean nice little shop. Love it.
