They were served with fideo; Mexican spaghetti that tastes like Mexican rice; guacamole,  pico, sour cream.   To me the food was bland,  but i did grow up eating TexMex.  We waited forever for our check. Server was doing as well as he could with it being a busy Monday.  Food was not impressive.  It felt  like i am in a Mexican Cracker Barrel with log chairs, rustic wood paneled walls and a non function train that should run around the top portion of.the room. I don't expect to ever go back.
