qxVcSWGKyH3HkkHV8NinDA Took like 20 mins to get a beer when there was like a total of 3 people sitting at the bar and maybe 7-9 tables. It's was not busy and had plenty of staff on hand. I watched the bartender stand around and clean cuz the order never even came in. Pretty sure my server forgot and a spark went off when I kept eyeing her every time she passed.

Tacos were pretty bland and dry. Was kinda annoyed I paid $3 for one ear of corn but actually was really good and totally worth it. The drink menu looked good too.

Overall I'd never eat here again, however id probably come by for happy hour or something like that. Never for a meal, not that type of place in my opinion.
