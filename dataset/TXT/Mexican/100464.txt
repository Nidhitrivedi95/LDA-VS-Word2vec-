eSENXDnnNSo-MLLkWJQ8Vg Another Diner, Drive-Ins and Dives spot. GREAT gourmet tacos. SO MUCH FOOD. They have a small bar, but we didn't have drinks. Just lunch on this Sunday. Chicken so good, You can get a 3 taco (mix and match) plate with rice and beans for $13.98.   RICE SO GOOD. 

Tried the horacha, not sure it's for me, but it was all gone before we left. Great prices, the waitress was very friendly. GREAT FRESH SALSA BAR. We will be back for sure.
