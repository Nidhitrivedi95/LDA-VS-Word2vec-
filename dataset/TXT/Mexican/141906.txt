Jd2NUZeVeyWi1tTNKXMt1Q My favorite New Mexico food anywhere outside of Albuquerque!!  Nice atmosphere, good service, great food. I love the stuffed sopapilla and we all love the sopapilla for dessert. Don't forget the honey!  

Hint:  if you want a "normal" portion go for lunch.  Otherwise they are HUGE. Also, be careful with the salsas as they're all very hot!
