dOkrbSdJ3FxXhGqdOHgL9A Not bad at all, but falls just short of being great!

Owned by the same people as the ambitious (but struggling) Local Tavern, and the new comer to downtown Willoughy, Local Sol.

Taco Local checks all the right boxes.  Mexican/ Island vibe, check.  Mexican (not Tex Mex!) food like street tacos and tortas, check!  Over stuffed burritos to appeal to the Chipotle crowd, check!  Mexican beers and slushy machine with "margaritas", check!

The problem is every box is checked but none of them are checked in such a way that things make me want to come back.   The street tacos are good, but I want more out of my flour tortilla than being half heartedly steamed so that they're kinda soggy and only slightly warmed.  The tortas are good, the guacamole is good, the selection of salsas is good, but nothing is great.

The service is....  there....    The staff is there to get a paycheck, but no one has ever made me think they enjoyed working there.
