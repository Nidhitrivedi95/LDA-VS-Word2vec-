DEF77d-_S0UT2OI-njM5fQ I've rarely been treated to such derelict, rushed, and inconsiderate service at any other restaurant. From the moment we walked in the door, it was clear my date and I were an inconvenience, intolerably near closing time. If we had worn scarlet letters on our chests, we wouldn't have felt more unwelcome in colonial New England.

The server and hostesses communicated their disdain for our late arrival with rude glances, prompting requests, and ultimately pulled the signed bill from beneath my elbow in the middle of a conversation under the cover of the din from the still-crowded bar. I almost asked if someone would be willing to front the cab fare home, so eager was the staff at this establishment to see us gone. 

We ordered two cocktails and two main dishes less than 5 minutes after being seated. The drinks were average, the pork tasty and the chicken nachos were quite good. But we felt like we were stabbing innocent children with our utensils the entire 50 minutes we spent inside the building. 

Neither of us will be back.
