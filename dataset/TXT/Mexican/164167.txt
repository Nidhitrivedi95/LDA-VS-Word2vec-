lhwIw2i5JNUlUBmWRAYSDg I'm a Taco Bell addict.  If I'm on the road and hungry, I'll run for the border.  Needless to say, there are some awful Taco Bells out there.  This is a really nice one. (The one on Indian Bend is good too, but this one is usually less busy.)  Today, Ashley S. gave me service that was review worthy.  She anticipated my needs with my 4 year old and 2 year old, and then made the suggestion to make several of my a la carte items into a combo to save a little bit of money.  Awesome!  That's the kind of service that creates loyalty.  My prior experience here required manager attention, and Ashley -- today's cashier -- just made up for all prior issues.  Food was great (if you like Taco Bell), the brewed iced tea was fresh (my main complaint about the FLW/Shea location), the bathroom was clean (I'm talking two kids with dad in the bathroom "don't-touch-anything-mode" memorably clean), and the restaurant was spotless (if you have been to Taco Bell before elsewhere, you probably think I'm lying, I'm not!).
