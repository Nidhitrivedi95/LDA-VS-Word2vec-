svdEhLmNmpVaIv1WLtoOvQ We love this place!  Everything about it is awesome! I love how small and cute the layout is. When I dine here I usually sit at the bar for quicker bar service because I can't wait to try the new beers. The selection of beer is on point!  I love when Natalie is working, she is the best!  She always has great recommendations & knows her stuff.  
I recommend a Modelo michelada & the BBQ beef taco- it has mashed potatoes on it! It's such a weird and unique combination but it works!
