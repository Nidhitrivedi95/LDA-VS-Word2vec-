VuIIfIAEtGFXcAcXCvK-1g Had a solid first experience here over the weekend. The girl working at the counter was friendly and walked us thru the menu after we explained that this was our first time in. I tried to order a burrito that included chorizo but they were out of that so I'll save it for my next trip. The "fry plates" are basically nachos with French fries in place of chips and that was quite good. My only knock on the place is that the burrito should either be full of more ingredients or they should use a smaller tortilla. I shouldn't be biting into several layers of tortilla in my burrito. 

We'll definitely be back to check out more of the menu soon.
