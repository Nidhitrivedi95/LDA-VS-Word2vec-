VIJ2KiDKhUVhhpNylEIfog I'm so glad this place opened down the street from me! Easily the best of the six Mexican restaurants that line Green St. Fresh ingredients, authentic dishes, low prices and friendly staff. Did I mention the portions are massive?

This isn't the best place to sit down and eat during peak hours, but the decor is eye-catching and the music is soothing. Do yourself a favor and check it out.
