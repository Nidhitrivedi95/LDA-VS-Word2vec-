JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg After eating here at least 50 times, I figured it was time to leave a review.

The food is some of the best I've ever had. Anywhere. It's hard to go wrong. Throw a dart at the menu from a distance, order whatever meal the dart lands on, and you'll love it.

Everything is great - some of my favorites include:
-The house salad, add chicken
-The taco plate (the Cochinita is downright the best taco I've ever had)
-Chicken lettuce wraps (add the habanero sauce)
-Chicken or Mahi signature bowls (makes for 2 meals) -Chilaquiles (you can't beat this breakfast anywhere else in Vegas. This is not hyperbole)

The staff are all super friendly, swift, and thorough. They care about good service and give the place a great energy.

It's hard to find a non-GMO, organic eatery in Vegas. In fact, one of only two of them I know of. There's not much of a market for it in this city; the locals and tourists here aren't particularly discerning when it comes to their food. But for those of us who care, this place is like a sanctuary. A food sanctuary.
 
I'll really miss this place. Come to Portland El Dorado Cantina!
