B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA One of my favorite places in Vegas to grab a quick lunch. This location is close to the strip, easier to get to for people visiting town. They also deliver as well through Uber Eat.

I've been here quite a few times. I always get a customized sushi burrito with soy paper. They have a lot of selections to add in. From hot food to cuts of fresh fish. Think of this place like Chipotle. Basically you go down the line selecting what you want I your burrito or bowl. You can add as much as you want. There are some items that have an up charge.

If you get a burrito with soy or seaweed make sure you eat it soon. It can get soggy after a while. Though I never had a problem with the wrapper ripping. Everything seems to stay together.
