cRMC2eQ9CP6ivhEY8EdaGg Even for someone like me who loves California burritos (french fries inside), ordering the pork with chow mein was an adventure. I'm happy to say that it was surprisingly good and interesting, a nice blend of favors that you wouldn't expect.

The size was normal, nothing out of this world, and filling enough for a meal. The choice of Jarritos and real spicy chipotle sauce were great for the food. The only thing was that the price, considering that you're mixing two of the cheapest cuisines around, seemed a little high. Take off a buck o two, or offer combos so I don't end up paying $12 for a burrito and drink, and I'll become a regular.
