LQZ2yBIAFmXYbDD0Z2Nhug Found in the forum food court of Caesar's palace. I paid $18+ for a cheese quesadilla, chips with queso, and a fountain drink. The quesadilla was a greasy nightmare that I'm sure will not be settling well in my stomach. The chips and queso were OK, nothing spectacular. Ridiculously over priced for what it is. This same food would have cost me less than $10 at a proper sit down Mexican restaurant so it definitely shouldn't cost nearly double in a food court. Save your money and go to a real Mexican place.
