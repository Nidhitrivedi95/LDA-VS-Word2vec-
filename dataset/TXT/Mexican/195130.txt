Oto60yDwk1z72WmfWEYrjg Dined here with my husband while we stayed at the South Point hotel during a recent vacation, and enjoyed our experience, but not so much the food. The dining area offers tables and chairs or booths-it's always nice to have the option. We were seated at a booth and within just a minute or two we had chips, salsa, guac, and beans on our table. I loved the taste of the salsa-not too spicy, but very flavorful. We ordered 2 strawberry margaritas with our coupon from South Point (good for free margaritas), which we found to be just okay. To me it tasted like a margarita mix and I've definitely had better. My husband and I both ordered an entree, which included beans and rice. The portion sizes are pretty generous, but I was a bit disappointed with the taste of my chicken enchiladas, which didn't seem to have any flavor. I enjoyed the rice and beans, but couldn't finish my enchiladas, even when I added sour cream. The service here was great-our waiter was very friendly and attentive, which we appreciated. Great service and fun atmosphere, but taste of food and margs not the best, especially for the price you pay.
