zwNC-Ow4eIMan2__bS9-rg It is a neat experience.  The ordering process is fairly complicated, which is actually fun! It's an authentic style of ordering, according to someone I know who lived in Mexico. Some lines are for one kind of food, and other lines are for another kind of food, and so on. You pay at the end. The view of the cooking process is fascinating and fun, almost like you are in a movie, or viewing one. The food itself is fine. The carnitas taco was really good, and the other tacos were fine. The tortillas are a little dry, but that's okay. The atmosphere is one of neighborhood families, and not tourists, but all will feel welcome.  I really like the Mexican corrido music playing!
