XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Had brunch on a Sunday morning and did not wait at all. Food was excellent!  The waffle was out of this world!!!  Our waitress was not as friendly as I would have hoped or expected but I will overlook that because the food was so good. A restaurant not to be missed when you're in Vegas.
