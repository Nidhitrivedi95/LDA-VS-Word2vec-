RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg One of the absolute most authentic Tijuana style Mexican food places out there. All of their items are awesome. Stopped by the one in the strip north of the Wynn to get a quick bite before heading out to the airport to catch a plane back home. Perfect meal to satisfy your stomach prior to a 5+ hour plane ride. Their food is not greasy at all like most places. They make everything right in front of you - all made to order items which makes it very fresh. My wife and I had the tacos - tripas (beef tripe), asadas (steak), el pastor (pork cut right in front of you) and the lengua (beef tongue). All were great. I also ordered a beef quesadilla which was a nice dish as well.  They can get quite busy at times and the line builds up pretty quickly however they do move the lines fairly fast. They have a good system going. Clean eating area making it very comfortable to dine in. Highly recommended.
