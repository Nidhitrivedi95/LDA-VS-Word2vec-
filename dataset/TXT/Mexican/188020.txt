o5Mofj5KJkYAMs_fhxftpg Best food in Champaign-Urbana area! If you like Chipotle, you will absolutely love this place! I've had the spicy pork, chicken and steak on a burrito, tacos and nachos, and they've all been awesome.
My favorite would probably have to be the spicy pork burrito if I were to recommend something for your first visit. But you can't really go wrong because all the food is awesome!
