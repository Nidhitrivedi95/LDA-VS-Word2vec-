-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg Go on Taco Tuesday for $2 tacos. The meat is always tender and the tacos flavorful. My ultimate favorite though, is their market veggies. Y'all need to order a side of their market veggies - it's not what you'd typically find at your usual restaurant. The veggies are slightly spicy, flavorful, and are melt in your mouth delicious. The market veggies change daily, so come in with an open mind!

This is my favorite taco shop in Gilbert. You really can't go wrong. True to their name, this place is an absolute joy to go to. 

Also, they have a great happy hour (2-6 pm)!!
