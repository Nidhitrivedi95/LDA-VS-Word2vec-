xStWlT67YUdrdhfrNP0eQQ Let's start with what is right. The building is great. Old brick, cool decor. There's a large parking lot out back. Lots of outdoor seating behind the building in front of the parking lot. The bar is beautiful. Tons of seating in the bar room and the dining room. Great ambiance. 

The tequila menu is impressive. There's five pages of tequilas. Lots of good sipping tequilas and they make some impressive margaritas. They were $8 each and very tasty.

What needs some work. It's not fine-dining, nor is it taqueria prices. I'm always skeptical when I have to pay for chips and salsa. They need to be really good. The chips were excellent. Crisp, not greasy, well seasoned.. The salsa was fine, but there was not enough for the chips. The entrees were all about $2 - $3 more than you would pay at most Mexican joints. Not a big deal, but enough to make you expect something special. I had the Pueblo Anasazi Burrito. It was fine, a little heavy on the cheese and beans. It came with a tiny ramekin of salsa -- only enough to put on a couple of bites of burrito. The rice was tasty, the pinto beans were toothy. My partner had the B.L.T.A. Quesadilla. He enjoyed it and was satisfied with the portion size.

Our server was prompt, not overly friendly, she got her job done.

There was nothing wrong with our experience, but it didn't wow me either. There are other Mexican joints in Madison I prefer.
