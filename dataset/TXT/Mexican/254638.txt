V9KtZRYkprtkTPMDK31HMA I'd like to give this place a better review because it looks like they are trying to be successful. The decor is outstanding and ambiance is perfect for a nicer bar setting. My husband and I visited during the lunch hour and took over an hour and a half from beginning to end. This is unacceptable if this establishment expects to cater to someone on their lunch break. The server was friendly but hardly prompt. Our drinks were empty longer than they should've been and my chicken sandwich looked and tasted like an old piece of cardboard-like chicken had been sitting around and the cook dropped in in some hot oil and put it on a bun (it didn't get eaten). The only upside is that the cheese curd appetizer was outstanding... the decor and the cheese curds are the only reason I gave two stars.. this location has seen many different restaurants come and go and I hope this place gets it together soon so they will succeed.
