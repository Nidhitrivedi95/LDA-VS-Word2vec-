l9eqiZXVxZInW0HexFBpfA This place was awesome! I love their tacos. I had been going to Yaquis over by Charlie's but this place won me over. It's a taco truck so if you're too high class then better go somewhere else. I've had the carne asada tacos and my friend raved about the birria so that will be next on my list. Tacos are larger than your usual Street tacos. 3tacos were more than enough for me.....

Will be coming back most definitely.
