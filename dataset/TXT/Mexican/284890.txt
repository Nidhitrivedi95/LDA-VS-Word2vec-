y1VInN5m3RbHU59kiQbmxA Amazing food and I love love LOVE THE DECOR paintings of Frida khalo . The outside of the building is bright pink which makes me even happier I love how the waitress was extremely helpful to my friends that didn't know what some of the things were. I was little discouraged when I saw they didn't have a vegetarian plate but then the waitress told me about it and told me they would be happy to make it for me ! Super helpful and great service will be returning and recommending this beautiful gem
