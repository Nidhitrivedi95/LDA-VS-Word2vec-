suQugTjSMYMIrK5fAabC_Q All I have to say is:

Fausto's is waaaaaaay better than Roberto's!


Never get the food hot, always so-so, window person never understands English and even has a hard time understanding Spanish (every location it seems!), slow service, last time we ordered a shrimp burrito and after explaining what shrimp was at least 5 times we opened the food container and saw a BEEF burrito.

I can't eat here anymore, especially after eating Fausto's (which also seems to be cheaper). I hate saying it, but there's a Wendy's across the street and you're better off eating there.
