CsS9WsonGYyE3vINi5bxSg I really love the atmosphere and decor here. Very homey, yet eclectic with neat lighting. The food is also fantastic.

The ceviche was fresh and delicious, I love those super crispy tortilla chips! The octopus tacos are amazing.. the octopus pieces are perfectly cooked: tender and not even a little bit chewy. And the flavour is incredible. Possibly the best octopus I've ever had. The grilled baja fish tacos were good, but a bit of a let down after the other dishes. 

They have a nice variety of tequilas, but wish they had a menu, instead of going to the bar and having to get the server to explain them all to us. Also, there's no easy way to say "how much per shot? Ooh... do you have anything... cheaper?" I found the drinks kind of pricey, but I don't know cheap from good tequila.

The service was absolutely fantastic. Attentive without being overbearing, friendly, welcoming and knowledgable. A great place all around.
