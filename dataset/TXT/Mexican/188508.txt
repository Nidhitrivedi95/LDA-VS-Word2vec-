o9uXSzwBHK-BHu3JDe3q_g To say we were surprised is an understatement! Roliberto's is a hidden gem in the heart of El Mirage. They have a drive-thru which is a huge plus for those late night cravings! We ordered a few different items including the shrimp burrito (deliciously spicy!), fish tacos and a mangonada. The mangonada was out of this world! I couldn't believe the menu selection compared to other Mexican joints in the area. Everything was amazing and the price was right, too. I honestly don't think I'll go anywhere else to get my Mexican food fix fix!
