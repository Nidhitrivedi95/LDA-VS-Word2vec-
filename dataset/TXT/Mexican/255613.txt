vdZOiZH9sTseyll44waMuA The service was good in terms of our food coming in a timely manner and the waiter made suggestions. My disappointment with the service is we were there for my dads 82nd birthday and even though we told the hostess and the waiter they did nothing to make it special.  We asked about it when we left and the hostess apologized and said they usually sing. A little disappointing.  The food was okay, not great but okay.
