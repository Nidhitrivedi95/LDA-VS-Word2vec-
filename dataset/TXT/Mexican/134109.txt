iIjVO7cLD1UEmIO7G05Ujw I ate lunch here, and I don't think I am going to be able to eat dinner! I am still full.

I went with 7 other people for lunch today. The place was packed & we had a party of eight people. I thought we would have to wait forever. We didn't have to wait long though. They had a big party room in the back and they put us in there so we didn't have to wait. Thank God for a restaurant that was willing to be helpful! I was freezing because the A/C was cranking, but everyone else thought it was great. I think anything below 74 degrees it too cold, so my perception could be a bit off.

The waitress brought us super hot and delicious chips right away. We had our drinks in a few minutes, and she took our orders right away. I was crabby since I was starving, and I was stoked to be scarfing down those chips! 

She took our orders right away and the food was out to us pretty quickly. I had pretty great enchiladas, rice and beans. Everyone else was really happy with their food too. I ate more than I usually do because it was really good, and as a result, I am still full six hours later.

Great food and service, I can't complain. I haven't tried the margaritas here yet, so I can't fully evaluate, but so far so good.

I'll do an update once I've boozed it up here as well!
