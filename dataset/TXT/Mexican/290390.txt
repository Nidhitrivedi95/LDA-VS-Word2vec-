Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ This place is so silly. It's a mediocre breakfast spot in the Tower Suites section of the Wynn, and they act like they are Ladurée or something. My husband and I went here 5 days in a row because breakfast was included with our tower suites rate, and everything tasted like something we could have made at home. Tiny, tiny portions of mediocre food. We tried almost everything on the menu collectively. Although we didn't have to pay since it was included, the prices are exorbitant if you had to actually pay for it. $28 for 3 eggs, 2 pieces of bacon, and a stale piece of toast? No way. One of the days, they brought my husband's breakfast, he finished eating while I waited for mine, and then 10 min later they asked if we wanted our check! Um, could I get my breakfast first?! Also, we had reservations for every meal, but they never failed to make us wait for at least 10 min.
