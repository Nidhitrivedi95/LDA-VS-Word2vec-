_paJE9yQfSvo25BKBQrKZA I had a friend order me the doubled grilled chicken salad through the drive through yesterday but with shrimp , $2.00 extra for shrimp, total cost $9.64. She brought it to me and the size of it ridiculously small . The insides of the shell there were barely any salad inside . So drive back , and told them , I just wanted my money back on my debt card. The manager , Cynthia, gave us $2.00 cash abs said the rest would go back on Debt card. We drive away , and instead of refunding , she charged another $9.62 to the credit card again , Back to the drive through again , only to be told by Cynthia again, that she refunded it . I tried to explain and showed her our phone where the two transactions were charged at the different times . She said the refund will show tomorrow a day if not call the corporate office tomorrow . Called corporate when got home, no one has called as of now and only 1 refund had been back in the credit card . Trying to call corporate office again now . Terrible customer service and food service all around
