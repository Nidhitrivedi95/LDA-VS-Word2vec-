CVrySTnC86omXXAm0GJMyA Actually tried to have lunch at La Santisma down the street but the place was packed. On a whim my friend and I came here. We were the only customers so we were a little concerned at first. The food, however, was excellent. I had a chicken burrito and my friend had the chicken mole. Great value too. Give them a try!
