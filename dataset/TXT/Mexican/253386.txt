uZ0C261kg1YgvTMTEmIL0Q Let's be honest here...  the place looks scary from the outside, it's in a revitalization part of town, and it's cash only.  The staff can be rude (think soup nazi from Seinfeld) and the wait can be horrible at times.  There is no indoor seating and parking is crazy during the lunch rush.  But on the flip side, the food makes it all worth while once you can get past all of the pitfalls.  I love a good cheese enchilada and this place has them.  They make them the way I like them, baked... not just a tortilla with cheese and sauce thrown together like other fast food mexican restaurants (the 'Bertos chains ain't got nothin' on this place!).   I crave them constantly.  I've never had a bland or yucky enchilada from them.  Their shredded beef tacos are amazing, but every now and then they come out super greasy.  But who doesn't like a greasy taco?  The chile relleno is very tasty, but every now and then the seeds get in the way.  There is just something about the cheese and sauce that keeps me eating it, spitting out the chili seeds as I go along. The prices are reasonable, especially the lunch specials.

I've eaten there at least 30 times in the past two years and haven't regretted it once.  To each his own, but the folks who have left negative reviews about the service must not know the place or the system.  You have to play their game and understand that there are enough of us who love their food to outweigh any business lost from people who expect superior service.  Just an honest observation... not trying to say their reviews aren't accurate, they probably are right on point.  Bad things probably happen, but when you find awesome food that you can't get anywhere else, you learn to accept being treated like a number.

Bottom line, amazing food, iffy service, horrible location, worth the trip for takeout.
