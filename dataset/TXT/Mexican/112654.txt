G88BZIFPYrO-dT9a7ry1Kw One of my go-tos and all time favourite burrito joint. I've frequented the spot for years since it's opening up until I moved out of the province and it always seems to satisfy. 

I only gave it 3 stars because although satisfying and still delicious, the quality seems to have gone down quite a bit since past times. 

My go to is the chicken quesadilla (forget the salsa, double up on the burrito sauce) and I usually get mine mild. I once tried it spicy thinking I could handle it (I usually can handle a lot of spice) but they really do mean spicy.

Cant go wrong with good ol' comforting filling burrito boyz.
