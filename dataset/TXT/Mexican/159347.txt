Ktia9NJfvxVxTLVcEnw9zQ I think the four star rating is based on the fact that it's fast food, but I don't think it's even good for fast food. It was $40 for my family of five to eat out (same as what we'd spend at Chipotle), and I would've preferred Taco Bell, chipotle, Qdoba's or Rubio's over this place. Service was terrible. It was crowded. It smelled.
