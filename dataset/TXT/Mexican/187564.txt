o1Pjim5n8xJjjAE_v4RiHA We have eaten dinner at Moe's several times the past year--- always great... BUT today we went there for lunch.  REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE!!!!   we always order guacamole on everything we order even though it is extra $$. We have always felt it was well worth the extra $$. But on Friday, March 25 at 12:14 pm we got maybe one small teaspoon on each item.  Even the giant burrito we order had a little tiny teaspoon and that was even after I complained about the amount on the four steak tacos we ordered.  
Kim was the one making the tacos and when I said we usually get more guac on the tacos She said "This is how much we put on".  The guac container was almost empty BEFORE she started on our order.  So on four steak tacos and one chicken burrito we were given less than two tablespoons of guac for about $5 extra.  When I asked for the owners card she just told me to leave a review on Yelp.  I could not believe that !!!!!   Who wants a BAD REVIEW about their restaurant?????   She knew the review would be bad because I keep telling her she was not putting enough guac on each taco.  I said just because you are running out of guac that is no reason to skimp on the current customer.  She did not care at all.   By the way.... There was No Line at Moe's and when I was leaving I noticed that at Pieology, next door, the line was out the door.  I can see why Moe's was not busy at all and Pieology was packed.  I'll be going to Pieology or even Five Guys next time..... Do yourself a favor and skip Moe's Southwest Grill.
