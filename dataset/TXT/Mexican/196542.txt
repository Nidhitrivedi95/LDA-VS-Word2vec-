oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ This was the worst service I have ever had. To begin, the waitress came to our table, without introducing herself and said "what do you want?" After placing a food order she never inquired about drinks. The hostess was nice enough to get us water and we got up and ordered drinks at the bar. Another waiter proceeded to bring us food we did not order to realize it was for the table next to us. Our food was delivered, not once were we asked how it was or if we would like more to drink. The food was nothing to rave about. Do not waste your time or money. There are plenty of better places in Vegas to eat with far better service.
