0AQnRQw34IQW9-1gJkYnMA I was in vegas last weekend along with my friends and we decided to go into Diablo's. Before we went inside, we saw a homeless person sitting outside minding their own business and not bothering anyone or even asking for any money. All they were doing was sitting there and you could visibly tell that they were tired. An extremely kind woman who was eating in Diablo's at the same time saw the homeless person and went out and asked if they wanted anything to eat and then told them to come inside while she got them something. The homeless person came inside and sat alone in the corner patiently waiting. A few moments later, two security guards and two managers came up to the homeless person to kick them out and were being extremely rude and disrespectful to them. The lady saw this and went to go defend the homeless person and said that she had the right to be in there but the management still decided to kick them out. The treatment of that person is inexcusable. To make matters worse, the managers took the chair that the homeless person sat on as if it were tainted and no one else can sit there anymore. That is what set me off. Just because someone is homeless or on hard times doesn't make them any less of a person. I went up to the kind lady afterwards and told her that what she did was extremely nice and she was absolutely livid at how the management at Diablo's treated the homeless person. She even told me that she will never go to Diablo's again after that. I feel the same way. Diablo's for its drinks and food are already mediocre. Top it off with terrible service and inhuman treatment of others, you can find better food and drinks almost anywhere else.
