x5iQFVJkFl7fSXC6uVjwPw Went to this restaurant as a kid at their other location, so I was excited to try it tonight. I shared a sampler platter so we could try many different items. I liked the mini burros the most, but not a fan of the ground beef taco. My husband got a carne asada burrito and it was not his favorite. I really like their beans though!
