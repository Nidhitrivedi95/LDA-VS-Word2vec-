zJGtD3y-pAIGNId4codEEg All day menu not available all day as advertised on their website. Extremely poor service and they were rude. Came in around 11:30am and menu featured all breakfast items except for tacos, burritos, and tortas. I ordered a carne asada burrito and it came on a plate with nothing else. No sides, no chips. No chips even when they sit you down at the table. 

Complaint to manager and only gave 20% off the check and one free dinner menu item next visit (I don't want to come back). 

This place doesn't deserve the good yelp rating it has.
