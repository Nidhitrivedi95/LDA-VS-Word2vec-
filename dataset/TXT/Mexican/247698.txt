U_jPOTd-Z5KATbTYnDeNxg After working out at the YMCA next door, what better way to reward yourself than a Halibut Burrito at Burrito Bandidos.  I mean, I know I am fooling myself into thinking this is a healthy choice because it has fish in it... it is, after all deep fried, and then smothered in toppings that are hard to resist... like the burrito sauce.

I haven't had any of their other burritos in a long time because I love the Halibut burrito THAT much!

It is amazing how heavy the burritos are... but they are also good.  

If you used to like Burrito Boyz and find they aren't as good as you remembered, give Burrito Bandidos a try... they got the shaft in the name department after the split, but they win in taste IMHO.
