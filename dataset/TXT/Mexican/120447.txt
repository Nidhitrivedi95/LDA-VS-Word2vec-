GzBIAjAMHD9iVZK8BT6XMw Saw this place last week while at Cornish Pasty across the street and decided I needed to try it one day.  Was browsing places to eat today on yelp and it popped up.  After reading the
 reviews, I had to try it!  The place was surprisingly empty for lunch time on a weekday in the downtown area.  After speaking with (who I assume) is the owner, he said that they've only been open 6 weeks.   The service was quick and friendly.  The food was DELISH.  I got a pork burrito bowl w/a fried egg and Fried CHEESE (whaaaat?!).  Not something I'd ever think of putting on a burrito bowl but after seeing the pics and tasting it...SO worth it.  Cute lil place, highly recommend.
