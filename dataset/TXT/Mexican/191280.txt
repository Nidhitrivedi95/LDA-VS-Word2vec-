ofXqwIbHprYF6TP47XudOw I've eaten at the chain many times but stopped in quickly to this location yesterday with my mother the chips were fresh servers were nice I ordered chicken nachos like I always do I added jalapeños for the first which end up being so awesome my only complaint here would be that some of the tables were dirty and the rating was low for me personally
