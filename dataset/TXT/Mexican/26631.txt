3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ Taco Guild is your go to favorite church spot on Sunday, that will have you praying for more. It leans in the middle for high quality food and the unforgettable taste. When you walk in the interior is a church like duplicate from the windows to the the design, very awesome! But I also heard it used to be a church. There brand is to serve local and organic products which is very good it's always good to go local. Hey! You get what you  pay for. As the first time going here, I had a delicious 1893 which is very 2017, see what I did there?! But for 5 dollars why not get a margarita. It's part of their happy hour menu drink they also do 1 off draught beers. Also a awesome thing is they give you free chips and salsa, not just one salsa but 3 other flavored ones to try! Be careful it might be spicy to the taste but nothing's wrong with a little spice in your life. Definitely a totally different menu from your regular taco shop, they take it and make it an adventure. Tacos were awesome, and I guess fairly priced, definitely check it out If in Phoenix. Cool vibes, cool people local too! Stay hungry Phoenix !
