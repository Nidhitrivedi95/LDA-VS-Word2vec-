EC7NrIHKk6i3US_XJlDWDA I don't think I've ever had a bad experience at Julio's. I love the mini chimis (comes with jalapeño cream cheese) and the queso dip - both are to die for! You get free chips and salsa (they have both mild and hot) with your order and the staff is super attentive and always asks if we need more. The service is quick and everyone is so nice, it really has a home-y feel to it. 

They have a good selection of beers, both local and name brands. They cater, and while I've never thrown a party fancy enough to need catering, when I've been to events catered by them the food is still superb. 

Parking can be tight in the lot, especially since people park there to go to old town (despite the fact you'll get towed), but there is street parking near by.
