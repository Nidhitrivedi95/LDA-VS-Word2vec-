wWmFZerHP37Nqwc7ix0bVg I really wish I could give them a higher rating than my last visit in hopes that they improved but unfortunately it is not the case with my recent visit. My son and I ordered nachos to start. Very small portion compared to other places and it didn't taste so great. I ordered the enchiladas. They were ok but I felt like they must have been sitting out for awhile because it was almost cold by the time it was brought it to me. I ordered the 3 small tacos for my son. Chicken, ground beef, and chorizo. He ended up getting 2/3. Ended up with pulled pork instead of chorizo. I really had high hopes as this was my third visit. Unfortunately, I won't be returning. I gave them 2 stars because service was ok.
