lrAUseySfmFeZkWOGfsKnQ No seats, no sides, just tacos! This little taco stand is simple but amazing. You can get either chicken or steak tacos, each one is $3. They come with just cheese and the meat and your choice of toppings that you add yourself. I highly recommend the pico. Just be warned that there are some hot peppers mixed in.  If you like spicy, get the hot sauce too. Very good but the heat creeps up on you fast.
