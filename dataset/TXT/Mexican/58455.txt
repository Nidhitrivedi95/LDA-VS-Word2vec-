AE6SoD7Lzw9MLG5RXKG2Lw My partner-in-crime's burrito obsession is still going strong (whyyyyyy?!?), so on a recent work related roadtrip I found myself in a fastfood mexiamerican joint once again. 

Against better judgement, I added tofu as a protein to my burrito. Silly me, I thought this would be some faux chorizo, sofrito, or somewhat spiced crumb or something (anything! ) to fit with the 'Mexican' theme- but it's plain old cubed, silken tofu. Blegh. What the hey, people? Then again, it would compliment the mushrooms (!?) from the other end of the assembly line I guess. Tofu, mushrooms.... SMH. 

Rice, black beans, tofu,  corn pico, cheese,  sour cream and guac with pickled jalapeños has got to be one of the most awful, bland things I've ever consumed. The actual burrito is wrapped in aluminum foil and manages to stick so badly to it that the thing ruptures at more than one occasion. 

Free chips are nice if they'd be fresh and not stale. And please don't get me going on the salsa bar. This bar is the reason why I hate 'bars' of any kind; it's a sticky, disheveled,  gross mess.  And WHY can't I have salsa ON my burrito instead of on the side. Ugh. It would have helped the blandness for sure.

I think the employees working the shift I visited are allergic to smiling,  friendliness and cleanliness. 

My husband said his burrito was alright,  which is code for eh, not the best. 

PS the regular guac was green during my visit but the spicy guac was brown - ish. I was told it's because of the habanero powder they use to spice it up. Sounds like a valid argument but I stuck with the green kind juuuuust to be sure..
