6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA Food was great, SW Cobb salad is amazing but the service was horrible. First the hostess sat me at the farthest end of the restaurant away from the few patrons that were there. Order was quickly taken and drinks and chips delivered very quickly, even the food came relatively fast but after that one person came by in the next 25 minutes to refill water until the waitress showed up and brought me my bill. $15 salad, I can get that somewhere else with much better service.
