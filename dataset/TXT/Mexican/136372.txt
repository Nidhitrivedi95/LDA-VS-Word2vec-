ipEl9VOQz2GS9qaRX3MjYw Was in the mood for Mexican but didn't want to go to port credit (zoo) or downtown (traffic) so I decided to give this be place a try. Menu was pretty decent but I decided on the platter instead of the tacos. I also got the Guacamole and chips to start. Very generous portions I must say the guacamole appetizer could serve about 4 people and my platter was huge.. Quality was very good and authentic.  Now the reason I only gave 4 stars is because there is room for improvement, the tequila selection was good but limited and the place needs to find their image and either be a foodie place or a bar.  I will repeat because i want to try other stuff on the menu. But you should try it out for yourself and make your own judgements...it's new and still growing.
