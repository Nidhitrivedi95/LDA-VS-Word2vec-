Q4AWWdBWe_ojYX1a4ffXFQ Pricey (6 tacos and 2 drinks for $25) but the tacos were delicious and flavorful. We unfortunately couldn't tell which was which but we're not picky. We split everything between two people and wish they had given us two plates instead of just one. Service was quick enough - we weren't in a rush. Nice location - in the same place as a pizza place and donut shop. We got donuts for dessert.
