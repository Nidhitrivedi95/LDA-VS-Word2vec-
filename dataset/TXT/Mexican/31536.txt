4jm-et6RMcjOkmrC_IcuCg I had a delicious, delicious Michelada, and the molcajete Barbarroja. It was great, savory, and had a bit of everything, even portion wise, which was great for a big eater like me. My wife had the shrimp and octopus spaghetti, which was also great, very creamy and tasty. My biggest complaint is probably that the servers there have a look on their face like someone pissed in their Cheerios. They seriously look like they'd rather be anywhere else. Hence 4 stars and not 5. The tostadas were pretty okay.
