Fvd8qeJCXFbMYQk45S7iBQ First time here, purchased a groupon and decided to try it. Food was decent but the bartender George was amazing!!! Will definitely be back!! It's hard to find great service and there are hundreds of restaurants to choose from, service is where it's at!! I'll remember the service before I remember the food BUT I hear that their Sunday brunch is awesome so we'll be sure to try that!!
