lWmDrnqgU6w3gFaJyn_1Uw First time here...and I've heard great things about this place. First impressions were pretty good....the ambiance was good and the restaurant had a good amount of people. We started off ordering a tapas as our appetizer...the apple salad. It was very disappointing. The apples were not cut to order and were not crisp even though it was stored in a container of lemon juice. The bacon was not reheated...I mean who likes cold bacon? For pur entrees we ordered the scallops and duck meatloaf. The scallops were good however I personally didnt appreciate the jam that went with it...could have done with a spicy savory sauce. The duck was unknowingly served with the same exact jam. It was a tad too sweet for our tastes, but regardless of that...the meatloaf was absolutely amazing. The egg that topped it however was a bit overcooked so the sunnyside up yolk could not be used as a sauce. Our final conclusion is that the main part of the entreeswere cooked to order, as they should be, but all the garnish was precooked and we got the feeling that it was just thrown on...not worth the price.
