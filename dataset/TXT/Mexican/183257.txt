nM9NwHXy3EadihjJTG2i5w Another Vegan Mexican place!! Flavors are basically the same compared to a regular taco spot, but it's vegan! The tacos were delicioussss and 4 of them was enough for me to be satisfyingly full lol - and trust me, I can eat a lot. Their food comes out fast too. Their restaurant was fairly busy the day we came in, but we got our food quick. The staff was very polite and professional. Greeted me as I walked in, checked on me while I was eating, and said goodbye to me as I left.

Only downside I can say is that their horchata was not that good. It tastes very powdery and the residue sticks in your mouth. Hopefully, the horchata is different the next time around. The jamaica was a good though - not too sweet, and has a touch of that tart flavor. On the plus side, they give free refills for the horchata and jamaica.
