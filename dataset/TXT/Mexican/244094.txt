It was $13, not bad, but since it was a little bland, we asked for a side of salsa. Also kind of bland, but okay. Our surprise was the $2 charge on our bill for the salsa. It's a Mexican restaurant. Really? The house margarita was mediocre at best. The beer was really good and cold. Service was fine.
