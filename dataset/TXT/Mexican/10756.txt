_XN-GwzZwAyIqLKJsl2htg Wow so glad I gave this place another try! 

To start we had the pomegranate guacamole...yum! We next had the Avocado roll and the chicken Tinga tacos they were both wonderful. 
The best thing hands down was Coconut Thai soup, it was creamy, spicy and full of flavor much like a panang curry sauce! 

Service was phenomenal! Victoria was an absolutely amazing server! She was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and 
recommended the off menu vegetarian roll. Omg it was fabulous please try it out when you go. It has avocado roasted peppers apple.
The patio was a wonderful spot to sit it really added to the wonderful experience.
