The venetian is a classy place and then you got this random ass bar... That's how I see it. It's so slow in there that they have people playing games to get people in there. How desperate can you be ?! And don't get me started on the food. Word of advice, don't order anything with chicken it in, it's nasty as hell and it taste like it was frozen. Everything actually taste like it's frozen. Yuck ! Good place to drink and play games that's it, food is gross.
