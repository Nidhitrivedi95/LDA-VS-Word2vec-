1MrSwj8i2VEBHdp3IsWCpQ This place is awesome! Super friendly staff and wonderful food! I had the el fish taco and the governor,  the governor was a little bland but the el fish was beyond delicious!  The tortilla soup with shrimp is a MUST, along with their chips and salsa! 
Go check this place out!
