SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA The customer service is exemplary! They give you complimentary freshly made chips and salsa. They even gave us a complimentary queso for waiting. The fideo soup was delicious and is also complimentary. Everything was fresh, including their handmade tortillas. Best tamale I've ever tasted! We also had the flaming steak and shrimp fajitas. Margaritas were great. Best overall Mexican food I've ever had in my life. This awesome experience is also attributed to their friendly staff. I definitely will be coming back on my next visit to Las Vegas.
