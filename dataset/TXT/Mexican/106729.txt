FMo1PJTUV5OpyiZlnTM1Rg We went there for lunch after seeing so many positive reviews. 

Found the food to be tasteless and very expensive. I had a chicken burrito. In the competition shops, you get to choose the ingredients. Not here!  Plus for $11 you get a very small burrito on a tortilla that is so thin, it breaks apart in your hands. 

My wife had their fajita bowl. Some rice, beans, tasteless chicken, (so much for their fire cooking adding taste). 

Add two drinks, it was close to $25. You could feed a family somewhere else for that, and get a much better meal!

Tom from the shop, just offered to I guess provide us with some sort of certificate to try them again. That is very nice of you, but we will pass on the offer of more of your food for free. I was truthful in my review, and we do not care to come back.
