RyJIi1IP0UQ5qGbwazgsIA Much better than expected based on the reviews.  I would  go back to the restaurant and I recommend it based on our experience. We were a group of 10 and everyone liked the food.....the street tacos I had were really delicious and the portions were generous. Guacamole, chips and salsa were fine.  We are from California so know Mexican food pretty well and this food was very good ..... not the best ever but still very good.  We ordered the guacamole in addition to the free chips and salsa.   The patio at night was so pleasant and the service we had was excellent. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could rather than just 3.   I do not give 4 or 5 stars very easily!
