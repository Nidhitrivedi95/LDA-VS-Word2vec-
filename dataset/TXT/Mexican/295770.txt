ZCe93zAkxr2KOBU1NT0lmg OK, if you are expecting authentic Mexican food you will be disappointed.
The good points: The restaurant is very clean, nice atmosphere and a nice place to bring a date. Our server, Paul, provided  efficient, quick, polite and overall excellent service during a busy Sunday lunch rush.
Cheap drink specials. I had a $4 Bloody Mary that wasn't bad at all.
My friend had a frozen Margarita but I am unsure of the price.
The not so good points: I ordered the grilled Corvina Sea Bass with lime cream sauce, grilled vegetables and Spanish rice. The fish was overcooked, dry and the serving was SMALL.  The lime cream sauce was very good but was buried under a mound of the grilled vegetables and I had eaten all of the fish before I discovered that it was even there. The grilled veggies were actually quite good and the serving was rather large. More fish and less veggies would have been nice. The Spanish rice was nothing special but ok.
My friend had a veggie wrap which she enjoyed.
We shared the house flan for dessert which was also not bad but had a different flavor neither of us could put a finger on.
Overall not a bad place to meet for a meal but certainly not memorable or authentic.
