The decor is nothing special, but the room is clean and comfortable, service is friendly and helpful.   Although the menu provides a number of options and they have specials on the weekend, I have always gotten the Mofongo with the garlic shrimp.

The Mofongo is a large helping of mashed plantains mildly seasoned and topped with a good number of medium sized shrimp in a mild garlic sauce.  The plantains are dense with just a bit of a crunch on the outside, the shrimp are pink and perfectly cooked, the garlic sauce works perfectly with the plantains.  I ask for the hot sauce, which is a homemade green sauce with a bit of heat and a hint of jalapenos.  I mash the plantains into the garlic and hot sauce and it is a great combination.  

I highly recommend trying Ricon Crillo.  Great food in a casual atmosphere at very reasonable price.  Be aware that the restaurant closes early so get there for an early dinner.
