Iw9k29FJCZ0fC68oxK1NtA Small place with BIG Taste
Taco Tontos is 77% (survey says) of Kent population's favorite place to eat. The food is great, the prices inexpensive, the ingredients fresh, the service quick, and the staff sexy. 

They have a pretty big selection for a small place and the rotating specials are also good. The regular sized burritos do it for me, but the large ones are good for bigger appetites! Beef burritos with corn salsa are yummy. The great staff always spice em up if you tell them. I also get 2 different tacos for about $5.  The potato burrito is also excellent. 

You can't order from the Zephyr (side) window anymore, but you can call ahead and walk there. Don't be lazy! During good weather, you can get your food and sit on the next door patio with a beer/cocktail or walk down to the park (with a flask!).
