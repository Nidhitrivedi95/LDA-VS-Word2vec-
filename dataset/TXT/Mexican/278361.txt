XMrLwzmEAsfNpbKRC7vUzQ The story goes that 2 guys on their way from Buffalo to FL, stopped in Atlanta and opened a restaurant with wings, etc.  After the server told me the standard Buffalo wings were breaded first, I have to ask.......we're they thrown out of Buffalo, or did they leave voluntarily?
My recommendations:
1.  Buffalo wings are made by deep frying the wings until crispy, then tossed in a mixture of butter, garlic and hot sauce.
2.  When someone asks for "Hot Buffalo Wings, they should actually taste like buffalo wings, and have some measure of heat.
3.  Your iced tea should be refreshed with ice if it is melted within 2 minutes of hitting the table, and refilled within a half hour of having only a quarter inch left in the glass.
4.  If you have run out of spoons, don't just deliver the bowl of chili without one and wait until it is cold to come back-then deliver a plastic spoon 5 minutes after.
5.  On Sunday afternoon, instead of having Euro league basketball on all TV'S but 1 (and the other had bowling), maybe you could tune in a baseball game or 2, the NASCAR race, or even a real NBA game on a few screens.

Just a few suggestions to make your next 1st time visitor come back.  This 1st time visitor won't be back.
