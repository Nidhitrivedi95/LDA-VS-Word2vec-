T5UBAJt5Kod_wQGbH6m9hA I had the Shrimp Cocktail and ceviche tostadas.  Shrimp Cocktail had a generous amount of large shrimp but lacked flavor and substance in the sauce/juice.  The ceviche tostadas were ok but nothing to write home about.  I think their big draw are the beers and other drinks.  The customer service was top notch everyone was very friendly.
