bU6IZNKS7NcFVfZppkTHAg Yum! Thank you google for directing me to Cozumel! Passing thru on my way home from Columbus we were looking for a Mexican restaurant. The menu has a few items for those that are just there to accompany the Mexican food addict., mice touch. ..My companion had a regular Margarita and the chimichangas huge portion as expected and very yummy.  I also choose the chimichangas and was not disappointed.  The only disappointment was the salsa. .it was to watery for my taste. .i like a thicker salsa that stays on your chip!    Definitely worth the trip!
