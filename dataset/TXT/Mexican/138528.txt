Iz_SYYhg-fQDQcVgkX9Zxg My husband and I were craving authentic Mexican food and wanted to try a new place and thanks to Yelp we found this place. Based on their reviews and being close to home we decided to give it a try. When we went in la guerita told us to have a seat where we would like. The setting was perfect, clearly reminding me of my beautiful Mexico. They brought us chips and salsa first, then sopa de fideo and finally our food. Let me tell you, everything was awesome. My husband is super picky when it comes to any type of food, so for him to like the salsas and the sopa de fideo, it's a good sign. Finally they brought us our order, he order a shrimp cocktail and a fish ceviche tostada. Last minute we decided to order a preparada, and it was pretty good, loved the chamoy and tajin rim. He really enjoyed his food, no complaints. In regards to me, I ordered the asada huarache, and it was super delicious! I rarely like beans at food places, but the beans that were on the huarache were the best I've had, not sure if they fried them in manteca (pork lard) but they had that similar flavor, they were soooo good topped with shredded lettuce, tomato and cheese. We never order dessert when we go out, but today we decided to order the churros. They were the perfect way to finish our visit at The Nopal. If you are looking for a great place with authentic Mexican food and awesome customer service definitely give them a try, you will not regret it. Definitely found our go to place!
