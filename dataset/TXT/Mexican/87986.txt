DMmeFKsUuMl0kDy7Zd7W3A I went to the Sandbar today for the first time for lunch and we had a great time. Kelly was our server and she was super nice and made sure that we had everything we needed. If you're looking for a place to go out with friends and get some good food and atmosphere, definitely check out Sandbar.
