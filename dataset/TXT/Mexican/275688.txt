xEBor41OFpeeKdcCZ2sfMg Stopped in after months of driving by. I can't believe I've been missing out this whole time!! Chips and salsa were good (I consider myself a salsa snob); the main course arrived hot and was appealing to the eye. The staff from the hostess who took us to our table, the bussers, and wait staff (Bella) were all very attentive. I had the carnitas de pollo which was a first for me, but I'll definitely have it again. This place is a keeper!
