pomGBqfbxcqPv14c3XH-ZQ I loved everything about this place! Reminded me of our favorite Mexican spot in LA.  We sat at the bar and the female bartender ( shucks, I forget her name) was amazing. We were there on a Monday night. It was our first time and we had a blast. The molcajete was a little light on the fixings but the margaritas, tequila and great service made up for the difference. Will definitely be back.
