wKA2y-F_fPcBDOkpzDB9eQ Best Mexican food hands down!!!! I have been searching for an authentic Mexican restaurant and I believe I've found it. We came for lunch & the food was awesome. They offer over 22 lunch specials that all come with rice, beans & tortillas. Let's not forget the complimentary chips, salsa, and bean dip. The salsa was LEGIT lol none of that generic watery salsa from a container. It was roasted from chilies and perfection to my mouth. Lol overall it's an awesome place with great food & service! Must try!!!
