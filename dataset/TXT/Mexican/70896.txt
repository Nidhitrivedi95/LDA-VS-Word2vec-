C1p3eAhzX3w8VxsJKH3iXw Let me start off with, I love Chipotle.  I had no issue with my food.  What I did have an issue with was the amount of time that it took me to get my food.  I was in line for 20-25 minutes.  And the line was not all that long.  The problem appeared that there were no systems or organization.  They were constantly screaming back and forth for the things that they needed to each other.  Waiting in line was actually stressful.  I did not have any issues with the staff being rude to me, but I did see and hear them treat others in line rudely.  Were the people in line always nice, no, but if you work here, you work with people.  People that are hungry are sometimes not the nicest, but you get paid to work with people.  So, get over yourself and take care of people.  They also need to train and educate the staff.  I had to close my own food container because they did not know how.  They just need better systems.
