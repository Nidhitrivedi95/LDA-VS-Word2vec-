9wNvIYUtUkB0B1LDyxapHg Great food. Quick too. We had the carne asada fries....awesome! And corn w mayo, cheese and chili powder....fantastic and the burrito was almost the size of my head! They have a big selection of Latin American non alcohol and alcohol drinks too. Deff recommend!!! 
They're opening one soon in pineville by the hospital. Can't wait.
