The fish is so fresh and the burritos were AMAZING! I ate here 3 times in the week I was in Vegas!  Prices are really good too.  I thought I found  a great Sushi burrito place in Chicago but Soho blows them out of the water!  Seating is very limited but who cares, get it to go and eat it in your car!
