DLwpjhatiSRN7QqZQwokSw :/ It was so so. Food was not the best but ....I don't mean not good --just I'm not excited to go back and probably won't. They charge for sour cream and salsa which I think is strange since it's a Mexican restaurant... that's like charging for ketchup at a French fry joint in my opinion. And it's a while $2 for a tiny little cup lol. Also there's no taco sauce ! But I did buy some corn tortillas that I can't wait to use. They had a great selection of tortillas. Also the guac is not fresh guac
