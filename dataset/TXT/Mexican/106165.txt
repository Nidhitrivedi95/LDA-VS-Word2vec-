fK1oj0dk9Bc6KsBk5mMDxg The Junction's "hipper" Mexican restaurant, we've been a number of times, and they've been hit and miss.  Tacos are good, though pretty pricey for tacos.  And had a salad there once which was really heavily dressed.  Generally though, the food is nice and fresh, and the margaritas are great.  

Wait staff is inconsistent.  Two times where drinks came finally when we were half done our meal, and they seemed inconvenienced when they took orders, but other times the service was fine.

Reservations are a must, and I wouldn't recommend bringing kids here as this is more of a bar than a restaurant.
