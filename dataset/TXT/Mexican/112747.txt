g9vzFlunYXagaH5hNkU2Uw I lived in Los Angeles for 30 years so my critique of Mexican food is pretty biased. With that in mind, about the only thing that was good here was the iced tea. The tortillas are store bought and not fresh. The salsa and chips were also out of a box as was the refried beans. The pork al pastor was bland and had big chunks of fat. There HAS to be better mexican food in NC. I hope i can find it.
