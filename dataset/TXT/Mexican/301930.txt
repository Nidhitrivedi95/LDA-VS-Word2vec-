zWcIYjspUkrqXK1zI7CWXg Eating my first ever Wholly Frijoles burrito bowl and I could not be happier. Super fresh, GREAT heat and spice, creamy queso... absolutely wicked meal. Totally unexpected from a food truck. The portion was super generous as well; definitely worth the $11 (+$2 for a drink). Would recommend again and again.
