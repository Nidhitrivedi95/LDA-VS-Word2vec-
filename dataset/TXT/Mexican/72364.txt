cChJhpiljARaINk-dyXGiQ This small restaurant is defiantly a diamond in the rough. Outside does need a lil work, but the staff was great. Very good customer service and very friendly. The inside does have a couple flat screens for local sports.
Above all else the food is amazing. Everyone at my table throughly enjoyed their meal. Also this place has the best salsa in town! 

I defiantly recommend stoping by to check it out. Prices are very good as well. You get your money's worth for sure.
As stated they do not have a liquor license yet but it is BYOB.
