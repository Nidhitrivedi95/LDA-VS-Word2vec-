RUxAdd3mmNkejoTAX2YIDw IT'S ABOUT TIME I find a Mexican restaurant that sells MEXICAN FOOD (and actually tastes good too). I tried the Bahia fish and it was delicious! I've had nothing but bad experiences at Mexican restaurants in Pennsylvania (especially the area I currently reside in). I'm not much on anything regarding customer service or ambiance (food speaks louder that stools), however, the place is nice and their server/waiter "Nate" was pretty cool. The only complaint(s) I have is that they don't serve Horchata and the other complaint was that they served me wuss sauce (hot sauce for sissies). Nate informed me why (which I kinda knew why) went to the back (with an I'll show YOU attitude) and came back with two jars of make ME sweat hot sauces!!! I'd come back again weekly ....IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO DRIVE FOUR HOURS to get there!!!
