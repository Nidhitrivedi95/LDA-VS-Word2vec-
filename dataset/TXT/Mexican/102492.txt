F2L2f-ITjnHlqKRFQVFsVg I'd give a zero for service if I could. Food isn't bad but they are really awful with service. They acted like everyone was drinking just because they didn't get the orders right. A female took our order and then later had no idea where our order was. Inconvenient and the owner was not pleasent. He was cussing, rude, in our face and irate. Would not do business here again.
