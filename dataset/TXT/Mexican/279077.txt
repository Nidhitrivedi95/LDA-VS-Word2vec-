XQRqEueK3br2lXRtBQPN6g Love the food, yet every time we go to this location, all the tables are dirty and the trash is overflowing. I understand you can get a rush crowd, but it is ridiculous. The last time we went, and we have been to this location 5 times, we were the only ones in line, and there was one other couple eating at a table, yet all the tables were so dirty that we could hardly find one clean enough to eat from. Several employees standing around, including one who looked to be the manager, but no one was cleaning anything. Huge disappointment. If they don't get it together, we will be back at Qdoba.
