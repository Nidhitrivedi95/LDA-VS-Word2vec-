P8IsTiHq5Hesa6UPL604ww Excellent! No complaints! Had a rough day and wanted good food and good libation! Found it all in one place! Going back today! Might try something new but the chicken quesadillas are a winner! I wish the rice had a dash of more seasoning but other than that it was pretty good! My kids are picky eaters and they loved it so that says something! Go head give it a try!
