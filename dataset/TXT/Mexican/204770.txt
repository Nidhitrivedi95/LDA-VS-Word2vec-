pUmECN5N94AQAe0DtptuYA I've ordered from Burrito Drive regularly over the the past 3 years. I'd say I've placed more then 40 orders here. Their desserts are pretty amazing (Chocolate Bread Pudding and Golden Rod Tres Leche) . My only complaint is that the portions can be inconsistent. If I ask to hold the rice and then choose to add $4 worth of additional toppings the burrito usually still comes smaller then if I had skipped the additions and stuck with the rice. I'm just trying to get more nutritional content for studying. I'm of the opinion that adding 4 dollars more covers the price of making a burrito of comprehensive size sans rice. I'd probably order from here more often if I knew the rice burritos came the same size as a riceless burrito with $4 in add ons. First world problems, smdh.
