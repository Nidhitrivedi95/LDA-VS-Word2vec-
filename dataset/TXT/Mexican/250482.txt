UJewG9UgVXQ7fyP4UHwnxw I'll have to add to this review as I go.
walking in: clean lots of space nice menu
reading breakfast menu:
No Breakfast Tacos
*sad face ensues*
"Whatchu talkin' 'bout Willis?"

I disappointingly order breakfast burritos for my
traveling krew.

to be continued....once My 4-Traveling Duckies have a chance to eat.

well the burritos were actually decent burritos. although I still can't believe that there was no creativity towards the  brilliance of serving breakfast tacos ... 
in a taco shop..I might be back to visit if I'm in Phoenix again :)
