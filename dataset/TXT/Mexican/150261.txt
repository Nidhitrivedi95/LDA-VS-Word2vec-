Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ The food tastes terrible & is way overpriced for the quality. The tacos are mediocre, and they were the best tasting part of the whole dinner. The diablo shrimp was cooked in a sweet sauce, far from spicy. The beans taste like bbq sauce, and are nowhere near refried. We ordered a pitcher of the cadillac margs, but the mix they use tastes very sweet, not like a traditional margarita. Worst part is that the service was great & location was convenient on the Strip. Too bad the food quality is so low.
