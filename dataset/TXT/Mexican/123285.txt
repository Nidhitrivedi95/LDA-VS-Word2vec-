hisaMvsxMzo08xigPIwXiA What a gem! Just driving by in search of dinner I almost missed it. There was a lovely complimentary ceviche to start and super friendly service - off to a great start. Empanadas with shrimp and cheese were delicious  (4 for a small order) and were followed by garlic shrimp platter with generous amount of garlicky shrimp, French fries, salad and rice. Filling and more food than I expected. Leftovers for tomorrow!
