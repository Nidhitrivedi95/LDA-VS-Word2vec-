GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog I was hesitant about a Chinese and Mexican place but it was delicious! Unlike other fusion style restaurants, the each item was true to its origin (ex: no elote dimsum or char siu tacos). We started with chips and salsa, the salsa had a roasty flavor and was very good. I had the traditional siu mai and the "when pigs fly" steamed buns, both were amazing and I ordered another traditional siu mai. My Husband had 3 tacos with carnitas and he loved those. Our service was great as well! Can't wait to come back here when we stay at the cosmo next time
