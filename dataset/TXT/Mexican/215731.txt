R-sEoZXf37pGzLnid7s6wA Pretty good place. There were a few misunderstandings when ordering but they took care of it. Chicken tacos have a good flavor and there is a little salsa/condiment bar. Decor is a little dirty, but not as bad as some places I've seen. All in all, I do recommend trying this place out.
