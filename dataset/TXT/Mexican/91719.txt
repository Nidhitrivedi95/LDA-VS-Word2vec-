DyOzNIeXUksPNLXYHnB-oQ Just wanted to give a HUGE THANK YOU To Meg. She is an absolute asset to this place for sure. I have dined both inside & outside for the first time last night.  She is the epitome of what customer service is all about & goes above & beyond to ensure an extremely pleasant experience.  The street corn is to die for & of course the mojitos & margaritas are a must. Excellent food as ALWAYS & laughter with friends much needed.  Thanks to the Sabor staff for making last night a fabulous one
