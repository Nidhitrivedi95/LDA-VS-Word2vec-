qdtfcYMROGZVvYcE9F23yg This falls into my top 5 favorite Mexican places. Their salsa falls close to 1st, they are tied with this hole in the wall I went to in Mazatlan, Mexico. I love spicy salsa to the point I want my mouth to be on fire and I need to take a break! This salsa accomplishes that. Not only is it spicy it has really good flavor too, not just heat.
