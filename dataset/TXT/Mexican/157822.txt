knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw Yeeeah. Not often that I break out a one star review, and certainly not often I do it for a local place, but Zocalo is a scourge on the culinary scene of Cleveland, and it's unfortunately in a terribly prominent location. I feel sad whenever I see it full because it is not a good place by any measure. Whether you like authentic Mexican or cheese-laden fajita-driven faux Americanized Mexican, Zocalo can disappoint you. Good tequila selection. Decent happy hour drink prices. Abominable food.
