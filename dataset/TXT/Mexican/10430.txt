I had the wagyu and eggs for my main and it was perfect and I inhaled it all. We pretty much tried all the appetizers and out favorites were the black bean hummus, pomegranate guacamole, and 3 leches oatmeal. I hate black beans but this hummus was out of the world- very garlicky. My husband had the salmon omelette which he cleaned plate on as well. Both dessert options were fantastic. The service was great, the places was very clean, and the decor so awesome.
