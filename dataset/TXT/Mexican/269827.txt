woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ Came here for an early dinner.  No resevation and sat at the outside counter facing the kitchen. Fun to watch the food being prepared. The artistry involved with the preparation and presentation is amazing. Their basic guacamole was fresh and had a nice little kick from Serrano peppers. Just the right amount. I had the maitake mushroom tacos. To say they were delicious wouldn't do them justice.  They were beyond with the flavor combinations. Had tres leches cake for dessert. Again perfect with a couple tangy creme fraiche (I think) quenelles that balanced the sweetness. I will definitely return when I come back to Pittsburgh.
