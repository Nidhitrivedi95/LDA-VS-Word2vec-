QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA I love Mexican food - and tequila just as much. I was happy to find this place near the Miracle Mile shopping area.  I was happy to learn they had specials on both on a sunny Tuesday in November.  Service was so- so.  The place was pretty empty and the server seemed hungover and dis-interested.  Luckily she did tell me about the taco and drink specials - 3 tacos for 5$ - YAY and 2 for 1 top shelf tequila!  Yay again!  Corn tortillas are a little thick and chewy for my taste, but I like that they have lobster and crab, both fresh and well seasoned.  I will be back to try the Nachos!
