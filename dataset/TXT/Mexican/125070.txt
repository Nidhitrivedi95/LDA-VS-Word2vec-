hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg What a gorgeous day to stop in for a nice lunch break. Carlos welcomed me immediately with a smile and some chips and salsa. I come to Tivoli often and love the energy that Carlos always has. Today I was unsure what to have for lunch and Carlos mentioned some of his favorite dishes which sounded perfect for my lunch today! Thank you Carlos for being so attentive! You rock!
