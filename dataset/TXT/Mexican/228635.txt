SAae44V24aD7y_HpgxjhPA The Hatch Green Pork was delicious plain or in a burrito smothered!  The seafood relleno was great too!  You have to try the sopapillas that come as 4 cinnamon and sugar minis with honey to dip them in and top with whipped cream!  Sinful!  I tried the prickly pear margarita frozen with sugared rim, it was great!
