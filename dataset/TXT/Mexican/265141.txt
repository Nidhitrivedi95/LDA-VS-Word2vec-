WCOuyKKNHWqua5MAKUNpaQ Sadly, I have to change my original raving review to a big ole YUCK now. The food which was once inventive and interesting is now dull, terribly cooked, and disappointing. The service which was shaky the first time around due to the grand opening hasn't improved. We shared our complaints (4 of us all had awful food) with the chef and the manager. Stella, the manager, was gracious and nice (though didn't do the standard that I would share with my restaurant clients and reduce the bill,) but the chef was less than truly interested in our feedback and in fact you could tell was downright offended. Sadly, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant at all anymore. it's another example of a new chef coming on board and abandoning a fabulous menu out of ego - big fail.
