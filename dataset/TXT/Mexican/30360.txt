4aF5GfnVkJPj9IwJ2yxPtQ This past July I finally hit up the Tamale Store booth at the Ahwatukee Farmer's Market.  I was initially a bit off put by the prices, but pickt up a half dozen tamales to bring home.  Over the past six months I've tried nearly every variety

The masa alone is fantastic.  Moist with a nice texture.  I could just eat their tamales with no fillings, but mmm the filings . . . 

The Beef Red Chili, Pork Red Chili are great.  I'd like a little more heat, but that's just me.

The Pork Green Chili is also very good.  

The Chicken Mole was ok, but I really don't like chicken in Mexican food.  The mole didn't seem to add anything good to the mix

The Roasted Poblano Chilies and Jack Cheese was ok.  Heavy on the cheese and light on the poblanos . . . if it had been the other way around I'd have liked it a lot more.

Lastly, hate to be a gringo, but my favorite might be the Tex Mex with seasoned ground beef and cheese.  Fantastic.

So yeah, give'em a shot
