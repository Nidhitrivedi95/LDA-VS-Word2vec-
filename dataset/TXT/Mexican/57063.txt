A8MmwHrMI0WnRTyQMdf8aQ The only reason I can come up with for people giving bad reviews is that they prefer anything Canadian over anything American.  

While all the burrito places I've tried have been nice and fresh, they haven't been the flavour I missed from my trips to California and Texas.  Burrito Boyz is good for what it is but it's far from authentic and when I want a burrito, I want the real deal and that's where Chipotle delivers.  Love me some carnitas!!
