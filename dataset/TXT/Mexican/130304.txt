We had the steak fajitas and stuffed enchiladas. The fajitas had too much bell peppers and onions but that's about the same in every Mexican restaurant here in the US. The stuffed enchiladas taste more like burritos as they have too much shredded beef but they are good. Rice and beans taste like home made.
