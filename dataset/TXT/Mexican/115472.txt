GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog When my friend, who is a premiere food and wine critic, suggested that we dine here, I was skeptical. A blend of Chinese and Mexican food sounded a little odd to me but I went in with an open mind. The decor is eclectic and colorful. The noodle bar is cool to watch, with cooks hand rolling wontons and dumplings. 

We ordered a wide variety of dishes on the menu. The carnitas taco was delicious and came with a unique pineapple concoction. The scallop siu mai was also scrumptious. Some of the other dishes were not really my flavor, which included the lamb dumplings, lobster taco, and a few other dishes I can't remember. I loved the Bangkok Noodles though. Excellent presentation, with all the vegetables carefully arranged in a colorful manner. The dish is then tossed together and tastes delightful. 

The desserts are absolutely amazing! The pastry chef is super talented. The mango with sticky rice is heaven. It's an airy version of the classic dish. A must try.
