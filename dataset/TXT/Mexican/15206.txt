10ELp0f3kgGfXPQNQq77ew I really wanted to like this place and back it up as a local place (sadly too many restaursnts have been through this same building and failed). Unfortunately im really struggling with a 2 or 3 star rating. They seemed unprepared with running out of meats, lack of utensils, and very unbalanced price points(the prices have gone up on many of the items you see online). I hate to do this but theres more cons than pros.
Pros:
- carne asada, pollo asado, and chicharon was good.
- tacos are $1.50 pretty average price
- salsa is really good, its spicy but not too spicy
- small menu(makes it easy to order)
- fresh handmade tortillas

Cons:
- they were out of Al Pastor meat!!!(come on its one of the main meats at mexican fast foods next to Asada)
- the chile verde and chile rojo is carne asada in red and chile sauce!!! DUDE.....
- some prices are outrageous expensive. $10 for a. Chimichanga enchilada style. Seems really pricey for a small and new joint
- theres no guacomole here
- very slow cooking(i appreciate its fresh but man takes a while)
- $3 for a side of rice not good
- chimichanga states side of rice and beans(according to them it goes inside however another person ordered t and had rice and beana on the side)

I personally wouldnt come back. And really can't recommend it. I wanted to be a Yelper who could come and backup a new place and let it be successful. Sadly i wont be that person

...well mayb on a groupon or something like that i might try but not full price.
