Bf2fuqWbHd3L-X69FSMvmg Best Mexican food i've eaten outside of Mexico.   i've lived in Mexico City, and El Trompo's 'Tacos Al Pastor' are very similar to what you can find on the streets of D.F.  
This is not tex-mex (which many canadians and americans are used to)... this is real mexican food.   There are a few good Mexican/Latin places in Kensington Market, but this is the best for Tacos al Pastor for sure.

If you are brave, ask the waitress to bring you the habenero salsa!  Very spicy!    

I'll be back here many times!
