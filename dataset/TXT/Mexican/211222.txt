qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A Service was good. I didn't realize it was a Jamaican/ Mexican fusion type place. I just went to have dinner with friends. Kinda pricey and the food was meh. But I'm not really into Jamaican type foods though, so I might not be giving a fair review. I had the braised short rib. It was kinda bland, and it was like pulled pork.... I might give the lunch or brunch a try though.
