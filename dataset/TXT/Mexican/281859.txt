XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg After taking my girlfriend shopping (4hrs) I was so glad to see Mesa Grill. LOL. They were able to seat us without reservation.  

Our Appetizer was Blue Corn Lobster Taco (5 stars) Chunks of tasty lobster and crunchy taco shells

Chipotle Glazed Rib Eye (5 stars) I'm salivating just thinking about this dish. Charred and crispy on the outside and so juicy in the middle. (PERFECT) A genius dish!. I can't say enough good things about this dish. Generous portion too. 

Black Angus New York strip steak (4 3/4 stars) My GF's dish. I think my taste bud was spoiled by my Chipotle Glazed Rib Eye. 

For dessert our waiter recommended the Deep Dish Banana cream pie (3 stars) May be they had a off night preparing this dish. But I don't care..my rib eye was sooo good that no other meal can spoil my dining experience here. 

I wonder how my Chipotle Rib Eye would taste if Mr Iron Chef Flay prepared it for me. I doubt I'll ever be that lucky. But this was one of my most memorable meal.
