jqAdZf9PJo8lsRskc6T1Sw . Don't waste your time or money!!! I wouldn't go back if the food was free. Bad service and even worse food! Only the cheese crisp is worth trying. Salsa was bad, chimichanga was horrible, beans were slop, rice was dry and crunchy. Nobody in our group enjoyed the experience. Couldn't even get a refill of water, and they were not very busy. Should have know. No wait and plenty of open tables normally m and no repeat customers. Not real sure how they stay in business....
