DeiDY5I2scn86glfEVj9Ow I usually love these types of taco shops. Being from Phoenix AZ, we sure do have our selection! I ate at this location here in Henderson NV a few times before anything was not to my liking. The last time I ate their food, I had ordered a bunch of burritos for my family. Long story short, my grandpa bites into one and felt a sharp pain in his mouth. He pulled out a huge metal wire from the roof of his mouth! Almost like a large staple or a wire from a grill brush. I called the place. Even went there with the wire in a plastic baggy to show them. To their credit they did refund me the cost of the burrito. However they were unable to tell me how it could have possibly gotten in there. I won't be eating there again obviously. It's just not safe to!
