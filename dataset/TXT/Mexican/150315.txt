Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ They don't even deserve one star. On the busiest day for Mexican Restaurants they failed to provide basic service. They sat us, a table of 9 at a table and got our order of drinks in. We then proceeded to wait an hour and a half until one of us went to the bar tender to get someone to take our order. We needed to leave on time so we asked for our check to come in early and prearranged hat it be separate. The bill came but not separate and before we had even received our food. The food finally came and we still had no silverware. They comped us chips and salsa for 2 hours of horrible service, due to lack of staff.
