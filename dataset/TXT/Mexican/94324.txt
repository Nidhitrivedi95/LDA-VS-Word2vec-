E6DmUAHfSRCEakvknot-zA Went in with 45 ppl. Called 4 hrs earlier to reserve, the lady(server) said she would Oss on the message to the manager. I even gave her my number to call if there is any problema. We get there July 2nd Sunday and manager tells us there's no room and sit us outside in warm weather. I told him but I called a couple hrs before and I even left my number and he said he didn't received anything.  Well anyways we invest so much and had the mariachi and trio for hrs. We left the ppl inside without music. And we made the best out of it. Any how I'm going from now on to la Mojarra loca, way nicer, fun'er and service top of the line.
