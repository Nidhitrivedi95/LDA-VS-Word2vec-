YJ5CSYTHwZlqnR61P_lY9Q Ordered plain carne asada fries. The cost went up but my complaint isn't about that. When I got home and saw what they gave me, the order didn't even fill half the container (this is just the meat, cheese, and fries). The fries were soggy and undercooked. They didn't use the wax paper so the container had melted under the fries due to the grease. Store manager refused to provide refund even though I had a picture of the subpar food and receipt. (Sorry I don't need my car smelling like crap so I can show you your employees can't make.a simple order)

Update: spoke with owner and notified him of the subpar experience and my inability to go back the same night due to my thyroid cancer recovery. Still refused to provide any type of refund and definitely didn't care if he would lose customers over this terrible experience. Won't be going to any robertos ever again.
