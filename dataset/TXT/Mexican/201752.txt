plHKBwA18aWeP-TG8DC96Q The food is average.  The Mac and cheese had good consistency but no flavor. Utter lack of salt and pepper. We got it with pork and that was flavorful but the portion was small.  We tried to spice it up with a sauce but that was a $1 extra. 

My recommendation is this place is ok if you want to spend $7 on a decent taco. Just bring your own salt and pepper shakers and a bottle of cholula.
