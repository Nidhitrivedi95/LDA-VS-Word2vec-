jZwqcK3UF3Aa8nxrh9BHig I really wanted mexican, and since my previous favorite Senor Coyotes closed because of the road widening my wife and I wanted to try somewhere new.  We found this place on yelp with decent reviews.  Long story, I wouldn't come back and I'd drive farther to find somewhere better.

First, there is no waiting area, you stand in the way, with people walking in front of you, and waitresses reaching behind you for the menus.  Then the seating area is LOUD, hard to have any conversation between my wife and I.  We ordered a drink for my wife, which she liked very much I believe it was a daiquiri.  We ordered food and it took a very long time to come.  The food was okay, nothing to win us over the atmosphere and waiting area/time.  If you're in the area I'd find another place to eat.  We won't be going back.
