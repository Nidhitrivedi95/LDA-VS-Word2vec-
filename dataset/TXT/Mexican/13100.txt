0Ge4hEQ8HYnrkfm8UHj2BQ Good service and a powerful gyro, pita size was kind of small, which meant you had to eat most of it with utensils then half way through the meal, you could pick it up and eat it sandwich style. The service was good and the gyros came out pretty fast. I guess they have a fat man gyro challenge with 7 gyro's content and 3 pittas and if you win the meal is free and you get a shirt... Makes the place seem a little authentic and traditional. Vegetables on the gyro was just a mound of lettuce and tomatoes wish there was a little more veggie variety not a big deal tho. I'd recommend the traditional sandwich here. 

And there's a roundabout in the entrance which really added thrill to my experience here. I will come again... If I remain alive
