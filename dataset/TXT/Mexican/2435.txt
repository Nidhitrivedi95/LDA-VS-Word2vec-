-HYt7RFN333ATu9UwYcKCg This location has been my favorite for quite some time now, thanks to the usually personable staff, generous portions and great tasting food! I know it sounds strange for a chain restaurant, but the food at this location always seems to taste especially great. 
Today's experience was one of the best, however! The guy working the rice/burrito station was friendly and worked at a good pace. The (newer?) boy working the meat section actually paused to give me the freshest barbacoa -- and a generous portion, too! The cashier was especially nice and generous. (Also, I have to point out that these chips are perfectly salted lol )
If you want Chipotle, this is the location to choose! It's a little bit of a drive for me, but it's always worth it.
