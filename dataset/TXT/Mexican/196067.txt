oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ I went for breakfast with a group of 7 girls and we waited for over an hour for literally just beens and eggs that ended up being bland. The server didn't even acknowledged the fact that it took so long or say sorry or anything.. Very unprofessional. Never waited this long for food in my life.
