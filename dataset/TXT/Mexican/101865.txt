evNdyHPR1B8E1aIoUAsGrQ While I do agree that the service here is slow and they are understaffed for how popular the location is, I still had an overall satisfactory experience. They did not run out of any ingredients and were not stingy with the servings (except the lettuce). I also thought that the flavors were up to par with the many other locations I've been to. Yes, if you're in a rush and you see a long line, I do not recommend you stop by. Other than that, I have no complaints.
