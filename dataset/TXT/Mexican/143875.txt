JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg Although the food was delicious,
The two things that stick out in my mind are as follows:

1. The bar tender gave me a free drink for the few minutes we sat at the bar waiting on a table to open up.

2. I went with two friends. Their food was brought out in reasonable timing. My food was brought out so much later that they were both finished eating. The waiter stopped by a few times, he was definitely very busy. But never let me know they were understaffed in the kitchen or to just give me a heads up he hadn't forgotten.
Just after we asked for the check, someone finally brought my food out.

The food was definitely 5 stars, as everyone else seems to agree.

My particular experience was a 3.
