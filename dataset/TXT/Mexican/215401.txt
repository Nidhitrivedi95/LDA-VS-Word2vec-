QYuojrlW94mpEwnp0uUIWA This place is awesome!! We came here looking for a good burger. Not being locals we turned to yelp, of course, and ventured in.

The location isn't fancy, but we like that. See a hot shot spot in a glitzy hotel doesn't have to be good. A place off the path in a strip mall has to deliver! 

The pastrami burger is amazing. The parm fries are amazing. The BLT burger is amazing. The milkshakes are BOMB. 

If you want a serious burger joint, with a creative selection look no further.
