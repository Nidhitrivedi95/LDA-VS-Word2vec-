MmU8ak-uG-s1RbqXu13m0Q Odd to find a better Mexican restaurant in Canada than in the Northeast USA.  The waiter was very inattentive and was extremely slow on taking our orders.  The food was very good and tasted fresh. The drinks were VERY watered down, so I would suggest saving your money if you think you're going to get alcohol.
