XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Food was excellent, the experience a little chaotic being seated at a tiny table on the edge of the ramp next to the kitchen.  Reservations are more like suggestions, we had to wait 30+min after our reservations for our table.  So don't go in a hurry with show tix or anything pressing.
