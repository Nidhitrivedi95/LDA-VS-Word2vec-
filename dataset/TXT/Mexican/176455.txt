MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA The lineup is legendary, but is it worth the wait? Yes and no. Yes, if the wait is an hour or less and, no, if more. This area of Parkdale is still not the best of places to stand around and wait. And if you're hungry when you arrive, you're probably famished two hours later.

We had a plan of attack and arrived at 6pm sharp on a Sunday, to only just miss out on the first seating. So, we were given an hour wait quote and bravely walked around the hood. Being Sunday, even the Dollarama was closed and we settled on a small gelato shop that had just opened on the heels of the gentrification. Yes, we ate before we ate, and dessert at that.

When we were finally seated at Grand Electric the guacamole and chips and tacos that followed were full of flavour and well worth the wait. So, believe the hype but don't be ridiculous and wait three hours for $5 tacos.
