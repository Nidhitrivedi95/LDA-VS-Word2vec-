"Beef, pork, chicken mmmmm" Mulan anyone? Their fillings also include potatoes, and cheese. The spicy cornbread seems a little counterintuitive to put in the enchilada but man it's good! 

So many yummy toppings. Make sure to get the Christmas sauce too. I love the ability to choose so many toppings- it's a variety lovers paradise. Jalapeno ranch is also a yum yum but it's spicy so I asked for a smaller portion on mine.

I haven't tried the soup, salad or tacos but if they were anything like the enchiladas they are a good bet.

Fun, and BUSY and crowded atmosphere, but it's worth it. Small parking lot. Worth checking out.
