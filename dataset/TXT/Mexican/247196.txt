TxQBdyDktZSk1KVTWh71dw I'm not sure why I was surprised that I enjoyed Babalu - maybe because nothing seems to thrive in this location? - but I did. My friend and I went for lunch on a Friday, and it wasn't very crowded at all. The space feels much more open and airy since the days of Cantina, and we sat at a table inside. We were promptly greeted and seated, and our waitress was a smidgen slow, but super nice and helpful.

I got the three tacos - carnitas, costilla, and carne de cerdo - and they were all tasty. I think the carnitas was my favorite, but honestly all the meat ran together. I would have liked them to be a little bit bigger, but my waistline probably appreciated the normal portion. I also would have liked some free chips and salsa, but I get the feeling this is more of a Latin-inspired restaurant, not a Mexican place. My friend got the lunch special, which was two tacos and either a half salad or cup of soup, and she went with the salad. She also finished with the cinnamon bread pudding (waitress recommendation), and she didn't miss a bit jabbing her fork into the last piece when I said I didn't want any.
