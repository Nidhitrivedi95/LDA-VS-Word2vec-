zwNC-Ow4eIMan2__bS9-rg Delicious and affordable Mexican fast food in Vegas! My friends took me here today for lunch. We got soooo much food for about $40. Couldn't finish everything. This includes unlimited horchata. Say whaaaat?!!!! I had the chicken muarta and the shrimp tostada. Also ordered chips and guacamole on the side. They also have an unlimited salsa bar. My friend also got the Mexican street corn that looks amazing. I think my other friend also got carne asada fries. I can't wait to move to Vegas! There's yummy affordable food everywhere!
