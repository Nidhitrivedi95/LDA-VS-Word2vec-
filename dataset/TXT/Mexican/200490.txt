pEH8XwiyGOe1t7GlboAgGw I was extremely excited to eat here. I have read that this restaurant was amongst the best new restauranst of 2014.
I must say the Coconut Ceviche was probably the biggest dissapointment of the night, it lack that citrus kick I love about it.
The rest of the food was alright nothing really stood out to me.
The prices are quite high for the portions you are served. It is definetely not your $3.00 taco place 
The service on the other hand was great and I really liked the atmosphere of the restaurant but I don't need to go back anytime soon.
