giCq1MmW-_S2tvNOAHvJcQ Last night was honestly the best dinner I've had!! Came here for my birthday n my husbands birthday w some close friends. My husband heard really great things about this chef and despite living in AZ for over 10 yes we never tried this place. Well I am so happy we did!! We started off w three bottles of wine. And got the calamari, escargot, octopus, Mac n cheese, n mussels as an appetizer. The calamari was lightly breaded w a great crunch and it came w two dipping sauces. My husband has never tried escargot and despite being a little weary to try it, he loved it! The octopus was giant and absolutely delicious n cooked to perfection! Needless to say, everything was heaven in my mouth. 

I got the basil gnocchi topped with lump crab and my husband got the steak topped with crab as well. He thought the steak was phenomenal better than any of the ultra high end steak places we been to and the crab was a good portion and so delicious!! My basil gnocchi was amazing! The buttery soft and chewy texture mixed w the crab was to die for! I'm so glad I took some left overs w me!! Also my gf ordered the side of cauliflower and it was seriously the best! 

Highly recommend this place for people who love great food and amazing selection of wine! I'm 10 pounds heavier from basically trying almost everything on their menu but the happiest!!!
