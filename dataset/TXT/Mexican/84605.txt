d8lmIZIqmBC9oPM8y1dc7Q Loved every bit of being at this place. It is a little tucked away so you can't see it from the street but I am so glad we found it. While we were waiting for a table, my coworkers and I grabbed a drink at the bar and they brought their chips and salsa right out to us too. Now this isn't just the normal salsa you get at every other Mexican restaurant, this salsa had a kick to it and it was so good. When we got seated at a table and again the chips and salsa came right out with no hesitation. Our server came over and she was was very friendly and gave great recommendations. Starting off we ordered the volcano queso with no pineapples and it was absolutely delicious with chopped up bacon on top. I want that recipe haha Everything on the menu looked great but I ended up going for the chimichanga and my friends went for 3 tacos each. The food portions are outrageous and I love it. I wasn't able to finish my food but really wished I could. My friends also couldn't finish and could really only eat 2 tacos.

We saw on the menu brussel sprouts and bacon and we were sold, but unfortunately we weren't impressed at all. This is a dish that is best left simple. We would suggest not shredding the brussel sprouts and maybe keeping them whole or cutting them in half. It turned more so like a slaw with the shredding and the tomatoes and we wished it wasn't.

Overall, this place is amazing! I would suggest it to everyone. Though we didn't like the brussel sprouts, everything else was to die for and this place definitely deserves a 5.
