DXCho3TSX6qKsRoEjGoGJg Should be 3 stars as I've had my fair share of bombtastic Mexican food but the service we received earned this review an extra star. 

We came here for lunch over the weekend craving some Mexican food. We walked in at 3:05p but our server let us order off of the lunch menu, very cool. Lunch menu items are basically half price. They also serve complimentary chips and salsa too! The chips are seasoned and crunchy. I wasn't a fan of the salsa since I like chucks spicy salsa. El torito is better in this sense. 

He also let us sub Mexican rice and refried beans as sides, a second score. We ended up ordering a chicken chimichanga and spinach quesadilla which came out to $15 before tip., pretty sweet deal considering the amount of food. My boyfriend like the chimichanga though there should have been more cheese inside of it. My spinach quesadilla was good too, but not the best light option. It was a little too heavy for me as the spinach filling is pretty creamy and greasy. This would be a good drunk munchies food especially on the $4 margarita college days. 

We will be back especially for lunch. They also have a punch card too! Get 10 lunches and get the next free! Hopefully they have some salad on the menu too lol
