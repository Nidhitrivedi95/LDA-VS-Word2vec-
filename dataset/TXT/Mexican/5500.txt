_3o05Wdjfc8jOvGZ_q177Q ...the margaritas were really good... That's where it begins and ends. The food was really bland and we were charged $1.50 for a side of sour cream...which I didn't use because I didn't eat enough of my burrito to need it. We are big fans of Mexican food and aside from friendly service and a good but overpriced margarita there is nothing about this place that makes us want to come back.
