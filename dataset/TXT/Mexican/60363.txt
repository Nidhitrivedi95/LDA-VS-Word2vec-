aLIJSHJfLQuFu3CamjOS2Q We had never been here, always pass it on our way home. Read the reviews decided to try it out. I honestly don't understand why some of the reviews talked about the staff being rude etc... We didn't find that at all. Our waitress was actually nice and checked in on us frequently. Even the gentleman who sat us was polite. My son actually dumped his drink all over and I felt horrible, I was rather shocked how fast a clean up crew arrived and I mean crew 3 of them, even moved us to another table which was nice. The prices are a little higher than other places... The food was good nothing that really stood out good or bad. We didn't really order anything out of the ordinary I had fajitas, the hubs had chili colorado... Kid bean burrito. I wouldn't say I'd never go back but it wouldn't be my first choice.
