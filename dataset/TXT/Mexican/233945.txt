SUd3IyEN7n5OYEGyt_U5lg Has become our favorite Mexican restaurant!!! I've wanted to write a review the last three times we've gone, but I start eating their food and completely get lost in the food. Recommend ordering online and picking it up cause they are often super busy. I've had the chimichanga with shredded beef, monster taco, fried taco, and asada fries. Everything was exceptional quality and huge portions. Customer service is top notch and I'm impressed how the owner remembers his customers so well. This is now a regular place for us to eat. Looking forward to our next trip here. YUMMY!!!
