DljmXW8D07LVTA1Y69xosw Great little taco place built inside of a car wash, whoda think it?  Decided to try it for a breakfast burrito in the morning and tried the bacon, egg and potato version.  It was delivered to the table a was fully stuffed with goodness.  The salsa bar was very good and I loved the verde salsa on my burrito.  Eager to come back to try the carne Assad's at some point.  Service at the front counter was super friendly as well.
