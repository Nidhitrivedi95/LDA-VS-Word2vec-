ovApUucCKSb9k0lTP2JieQ What a happy place ! perhaps the best Mexican restaurant in town, and a true gem.  Simple, clean, well seasoned food, and overall delicious. I usually get Burrito Enmolado or one of the Fajitas. Pair that with a good Mexican beer (or the fantastic Horchata), and you're all set. On top of your main dish, you'll get  four excellent salsas (my favorite is the smoky-spicy one) and fried tortilla for snacking, so you'll never leave the place hungry.
