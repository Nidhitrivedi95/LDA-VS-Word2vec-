VRwT0pscR5vESCrAnUpNwQ It's like a fancier and pricier version of Chipotle, but also better! I had their rice bowl with steak, which came with guacamole. Plus all the salsa I can try from their Salsa Bar? YES PLEASE. My favourite was the one with corn. Yum. 

My friend had some tacos, and she said that the cod one is excellent. Although, I think their tacos are pretty pricey. Not sure how worth it it was.

But dayum, look at the size of their burritos! I will have to come back for dem bad boyz.
