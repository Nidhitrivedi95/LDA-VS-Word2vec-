vz8HFGsITt6aj-nyXkAEFg Holy moly make a reservation if you are coming here or expect a long wait! Hopefully if you dont make reservations you can grab a seat at the bar for some pre-dinner drinks! We were given chips and salsa while we waited at the bar which was a nice plus! We split the steak and chicken fajitas. I thought they were really good but I cant be totally sure as I was completely starving by the time we sat down! The refried beans and rice were also very good! Overall, the service was pretty good considering the wait time!
