WuO1CukY0k9neAQsijMYhQ Ammending my previous 5 star review, I'm very disappointed and starting to get turned off by Fat Bastard restaurants. Portion sizes have dropped dramatically, the amount of food we received for a large Butter Chicken burrito was shocking! Very small amount of rice, vegetables and meat. The containers are large, they are meant to be full of food, not halfway. I don't notice prices have changed, so why the low portion size?

I hate skimpers in the food business, give your patrons good value for their money, not the feeling of being ripped off. "Eat big or go home" is now "Eat and feel hungry hours later..." Unacceptable guys!
