The food was delicious. I got the milanesa and my husband got the shrimp fajitas. They never missed a refill, they were quick with little things like asking for hot sauce. The staff knew the menu and were able to recommend. We didn't check it for our free dessert because we were stuffed! But the waiter let us know that we can save it for next time. Our table was always cleaned. There was never a clutter. We will be returning.
