vz8HFGsITt6aj-nyXkAEFg This is a surprisingly wonderful place to host a small reception or gathering (40pple or less). Recently went to a wedding reception here and it was beautiful! The food was good as well. Great chimis and fajitas. The chips were a little on the stale side and the house marg wasnt the best (pay more to get a better marg) but overall nice place.
