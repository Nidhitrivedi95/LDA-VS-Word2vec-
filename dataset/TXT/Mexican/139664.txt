The jibarito (steak sandwich between slices of fried plantains) was tasty and I'd order that again.  Good for lunch or a small dinner, if you're not as hungry.

Our server was good and attentive.  We let him know that we were watching a movie at Capitol Theatre and he got us out with plenty of time.
