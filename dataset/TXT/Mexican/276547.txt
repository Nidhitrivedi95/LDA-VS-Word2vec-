XHidP878N9QMg5V-v7QrkQ The service here was excellent. We got in around 6:30 on a Saturday night and waited about 10 minutes for a table, which is to be expected at that time. We were seated and right away one of the managers came over to let us know that our server was a little behind and if he could get us started on drinks. He stopped by again for ordering dinner and periodically throughout the evening, we really appreciated that. 

The only complaint that we had was that all of the food seemed to be very onion-y. The salsa had many huge chunks of white and green onion, the bean dip had plenty of onions, even the machaca and chicken were filled with tons of onions. This may be pleasant to some people, but we are not fans of so much onion.
