WpI5MZC3XzlTpcUOKXzCbA My new favorite Mexican food in the area! I recently moved to Henderson and have been looking for a great Mexican place. I absolutely LOVED this place! Awesome super loud and fun atmosphere, incredible view of the entire area and the strip, delicious salsa, and the menu options are endless! HUUUUGEEEE menu, I was so happy to see they had Enchiladas Sueizas! My favorite. I got it, and the grilled chicken in it is great. They also gave us free Modelo's just for taking a picture! Can't wait to go back. The whole experience was awesome, such a fun environment! Good times!!
