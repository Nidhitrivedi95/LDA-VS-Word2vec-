J7B-hSSYDYSIQx5xiqOJTw We have been here four times and I must say that both the service and product have worsened each time. It usually takes a very long time to both receive food and have your order taken. I ordered one dish that had sunflower seeds and they were frozen with ice covering them! The tacos contents have changed as well...less meat and not as tasty as before.
