-1VaIJza42Hjev6ukacCNg The Surprise location is our normal stop, and we have always enjoyed eating there. But we have always heard how good their El Mirage location was. So luckily we were nearby on a Sunday. As it turns out, it was brunch. Many different options from their brunch buffet. However you can still order from their menu. 
I had eggs, green chili, beans, rice, and their homemade tortilla. Made right there in their facility. I had other items during the time I was there, just not going to embarrass myself and list it all.  Their food was great, been a long time since I have been at a brunch. Forgot how much I liked it. Service was great, greeted with a smile and they came by all the time to check on us. 
This location does have a different atmosphere then the Surprise location. I seemed to enjoy it more there. Had a great time, and we'll be back again.
