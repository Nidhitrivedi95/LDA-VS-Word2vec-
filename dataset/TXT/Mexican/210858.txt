QoKn3zRpDrBj3hCPYGDCSA Visited a few days ago. Expressed that I had very dry chicken twice before. Jennifer said sorry and made sure by showing me my order was good. Jennifer the dinner was excellent, our family enjoyed eating the very moist and delicious El Polo Loco. We will be back. Great job Jennifer.  Mike
