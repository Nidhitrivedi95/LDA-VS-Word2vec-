San Diego Taco is in the corner of the shopping plaza near where Geauga Lake used to be.  The store is nice looking with a nice sized dining area in front of the swoopy counter area.  Service was good, helpful and friendly with the food coming out fairly quickly.

The menu is extensive and a bit hard to navigate; I am a bit skeptical of a place that tries to do too much.  I don't need a taco place to do burgers, and international tacos.  It was Tuesday, which means $.50 off of tacos, so I ordered the Shrimp Taco and the Fish Taco.

The 2 tacos were decent sized, not huge, but both had a decent portion of the protein.  The flour tortillas were toasted to add some flavor and crispness.  The tacos were topped with a mild mango salsa, cabbage and crema plus a wedge of lime.  I would have liked some extra heat, but there was no hot sauce or extra salsa evident.  The cod was nicely cooked, mild with a little bit of a sear on the outside.  The shrimp were the highlight of the meal, with a good sear that brought out the shrimp flavor.

Overall San Diego Taco is not bad, but it also is not great either.  I can get better tacos for a bit less at a couple of places around town plus I get free chips and salsas.  I believe that instead of trying to do too much, they should try to concentrate on doing their core food even better.
