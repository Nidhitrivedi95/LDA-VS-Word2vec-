jAsvKe4-SteA-ZgyfVPoTQ First time at this location and I loved it. The interior is fun - they'll be moving to a new location soon so I hope the vibe sticks around. Our server, Julie, was fabulous. She was extremely attentive and friendly. Definitely recommend coming to this location and the new one once it opens.
