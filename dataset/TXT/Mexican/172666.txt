mcXRNuN1MsgXYt8B2MWz2Q I used to come here several times a week but won't after my experience this morning. I shouldn't get attitude because I wanted my burrito remade after it was falling apart and barely had any beans in it. She gave me someone else's bean and cheese burrito which wasn't falling apart but still had barely any beans in it. $6 for bean and cheese burrito is ridiculous as it is and beans aren't even that expensive. Not to mention when I told her what was wrong with my burrito she touched it with her bare hands. Then asked if I wanted more beans in it I said no I want it remade. I use to this chick was nice. Think she's a manager too.
