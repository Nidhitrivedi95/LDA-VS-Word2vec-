5NrkGcyY-2fBjQWkoYrNAA So I found this place years ago while coming back from  fishing trip and I was surprised of the authenticity that is provided both in culture and food.  Being a traveler to Mexico I know what the real deal is when it comes to food so I can honestly say that this place always bring me back to Mexico and the good times and good food. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for good authentic Mexican food... It doesn't get any better than this especially in Canada.
