g-E12y45gBKedax5N20YmQ I showed up at 1100, doors weren't opened till 1103.  When I came in I was asked to wait, it was obvious they were not ready for business yet al though sign says they open at 11am. After 10 minutes of waiting patiently I decided to leave as they were still not ready to take any orders. I was excited to eat here but the lack of professionalism and lack or customer service will def keep me from egging back to give the food a try.
