nEQFnHydeX2A3bRRDAKqQg The service was ok. I think I was a little miffed because I  got chips and salsa before or too long after they have me my water (salsa.) 
The chips were hot and thin how I like it but tasteless. Maybe it needed more salt? I got a dinner salad. When my food came my salad was the same as the side lettuce and tomatoes. 
I ordered the steak fajitas. Everything on my plate could of had more taste. The only thing I found tasty was the salsa. I probably should of ordered a drink, the people around me seemed to be enjoying them. 
I worked across the street for 3 years and only a couple is people said anything about them. That should of told me something. Need not spend  my money when I can get taco bell.  Lol
