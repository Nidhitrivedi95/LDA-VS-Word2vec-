9pWzjhdrPgsZEmF7-QOaIQ I had the carnitas and fish taco.  I agree with many fellow Yelp reviewers that the pork on the carnitas was a tad dry. I was dumping a lot of their 'medium' sauce on it give it some flavour. Their medium sauce tasted like a BBQ sauce; It was tasty and a little smoky.

Caution: Their hot sauce is really spicy!!

The fish taco was great. I think it was because it was cooked to order (my carnitas taco was ready before the fish). It was hot and crispy and the chipotle aioli was very tasty and was a nice cooling element. I only wish they put more of the aioli. At times all I had was cabbage, fish and tortilla and this was a little dry.

They use corn tortillas which hold up well and have a nice chew. It also has that distinct corn tortilla flavour. 

This is a very cramped space with very limited seating. 

I will be back to try the other tacos - but the fish taco saved the day.
