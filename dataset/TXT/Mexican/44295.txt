7m1Oa1VYV98UUuo_6i0EZg Ok so I'm leaving this review off of my experience. I had the Paradise bacon cheeseburger and seasoned fries. The food was very good. The staff was very friendly. The only complaint is that the tables and floor where dirty. With staff standing around this place could have been cleaner. But it still doesn't take away from the awesome service that we got. Will definitely come back
