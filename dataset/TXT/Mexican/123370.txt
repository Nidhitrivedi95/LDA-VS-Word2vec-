hJNjKc4sKgWG__KitlJ1ag Went here last month before going to the Real Marys King close. Nice location and décor but that is where the good points end for me. Staff where friendly enough and the food came out quickly but in one word it was : bland! No real Mexican flavour in my point of view. Been to better Mexicans in Edinburgh.
