EP1do6l8hLyIGEru0gN3EQ I was there just before Thanksgiving. My mom and sister are regulars and were excited to take me here. They ordered their usuals and mom barely touched hers; it was off that day. I ordered vege pad thai, which had zero flavor. The woman at a nearby table also told her waitress that her food was flavorless. No one got to the bottom of why. 

 I asked for more seasoning & was brought sauce I was told was spicy. After pouring it on and tasting it, it was sweet and had no spices or garlic in it. I told the waitress, who asked me if I wanted another meal. It's the only thing on the menu I could eat on my diet, so I said I wanted the dish made correctly. She wouldn't take it back to the kitchen, have someone taste the sauce, or make it again because "it was made correctly". When she walked away, I went into the kitchen, told the cooks the sauce was tasteless and suggested they taste it. Neither did. They explained it came prepackaged and their was nothing they could do. 

 One guy gave me a teaspoon of minced garlic, which I added. Now it was noodles, garlic and sugar- which nothing can make better. 

 My biggest disappointment is that no manager was called to address the problem, I was charged for the extra sauce, no one made the meal correctly and no one took it off the bill. 

 My mom ordered her usual lg container of guac with a side of chips and opened it when we got home. She paid a chunk of money and got 2 oz of guac and alot of chips. She was really bummed that the lunch and part of dinner were just ruined. 

 Where was a manager when all this was going down and the waitress, bartender and two cooks knew there was a problem?
