The host was really sweet allowed me to order my food at the front desk. I ordered the carnitas enchiladas and the shrimp appetizer. The enchiladas were really good, definitely order again. Although I liked the shrimp as a starter not sure if I'd order again, it was good but not special I ended up eating it with my enchiladas as I felt they needed something more. Bartender was really nice, I would go back and order another margarita from him.
