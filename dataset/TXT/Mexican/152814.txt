jzM4dTlstNmGDPRT9SC6Hw Not a great experience. Went there last night and the hostess act like snarky mean girls.... We waited for.an hour and 10 minutes or so and the system for checking your place  in line was not working... we.finally get seated and our waitress was this girl.withh glasses who acted very inconvenienced and also made.the most horrible and overpriced guacamole on the planet !!!!! She seemed disengaged and was.not.nice at all. The barrio queen in Scottsdale has the nicest wait staff this location on the othher hand could care less about customer service....
