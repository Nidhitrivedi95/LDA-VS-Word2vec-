ZoCCW3R_LEAzktU0rMbX8w I decided to walk out in the middle of my order because the spicy-attitude of the Latina cheated the amount of chicken for my bowl and she tried to charge me extra meat for an even smaller spoon than the fist one. I like chipotle but I guess I'll just have to find another location with not such small minded taker attitudes. Over a couple pieces of chicken they rather loose me immediate and long term business and the lady threw away the bowl wasting all the food anyways. So dumb
