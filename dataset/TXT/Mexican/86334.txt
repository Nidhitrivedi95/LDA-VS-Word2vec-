DEF77d-_S0UT2OI-njM5fQ I'm liking this place. It's busy, noisy, lots of kids, fresh air with the overhead doors open. The place was full on Thursday night by 5:30. Food very good, service excellent, a beer list that goes the extra mile. Just what the north side needed -- we'll definitely be back. I wish them well.
