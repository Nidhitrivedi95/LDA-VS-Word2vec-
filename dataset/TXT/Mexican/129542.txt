i4QxkI-oZgFLD_dShF4F7g My partner and I went there for brunch a few days ago.  We were walking on St Clair hoping to get some brunch and the place seemed appealing.  Since it was open at around midday on a Saturday we assumed they would have brunch.  Well, they don't have a brunch menu which was sad, however we stayed as the regular menu seemed tasty.  
The food was good, particularly the Guacamole, very fresh tasting & creamy.  It had bits of hot green peppers that were sometimes quite hot. 
The Cafe the Olla was very good, tasted the same as in Mexico, bringing back memories.  :) 
The mains were good (not great but good).  The side rice was just ok.  However they have Esquites and other authentic Mexican dishes in the Menu that I can't wait to try.  
Service was good.

(Mexican breakfast/brunch Menu -huevos rancheros, huevos divorciados, chilaquiles, etc- would make it better).
