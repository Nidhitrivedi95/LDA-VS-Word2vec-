0rrq-d9iNL2rrLET61v7jg By far one of the best Mexican restaurants in Wisconsin. Consistently delicious food, speedy service, friendly staff, and decent prices. We frequent this location. It's my husband's favorite. He always gets the Rio Bravo burrito. I always get the chicken chimichanga without red sauce and with extra guacamole. Either that or the steak and chicken fajitas. The salsa is perfection too.
