WcGKG8_rDVBVx6lSTlWiDA Cafe Rio is one if my fav tex mex places to eat. 
This location was a little lackluster. It was  dirty/ messy inside.
A lot of the tables had old food on them and the drinks area had tons of ice and spilled liquids everywhere.
The staff was nice and quickly got the orders processed. The girl that took my order let me try the new green sauce which was actually pretty good, so I ordered a side of it. 
My food was still good as usual. I ordered a chicken quesadilla that was huge! Chunks of white meat chicken, cheese, and home made tortilla! I always order chips & queso. The queso is always piping hot as well as chips. Their chips are always light, thin and crispy. 
I had the limeade, and added additional lime syrup at the drinks station. Just the right tartness and sweetness. The mint really sets the drink off as well.
I will def be back, but very unlikely to come back to this location.
