knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw The reccomendations that I got on this place were to stay away.  I couldn't agree with them more. 

I was here with a large party from work, and while the service was fantastic, the food was sub-par.

If this restaurant was somewhere in the west or east suburbs, this place would get a better rating.  

The buffett that Zocalo arranged was on par with an over priced Chipotle.  Actually, I can now see the value of a Chipotle burrito. 

Dessert was about as good as an easybake oven, although the pumpkin flan was pretty tasty, but still had the taste of a 'just defrosted' dessert.

I say stick with the tequila, and get nice and drunk and if you have money left, go to chipotle.  At least you wouldn't feel bad about throwing THAT up after drinking that much tequila because it is considerably cheaper.
