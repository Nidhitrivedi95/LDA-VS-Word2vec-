8hZjiPzJIojA1k7_W4hELA tried the food here a few days ago with my boyfriend. I got a quesadilla with meat , and he got a burrito. the quesadilla was about $6 and absolutely great! it was nice and stuffy with meat, and the meat itself had a great flavor. it had pico de gallo with avocado slices inside and beans. and he is not greedy at all. definitely worth the price. my boyfriend got a carnitas burrito and he was in love with it . stuffy burrito as well. great salsa options to mix in with the food as well. we will definitely come back. friendly owner btw!
