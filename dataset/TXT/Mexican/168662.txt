LVkILnI-bXtlCJggb3hfkg I'm really late in writing this review, but that is no indication of the quality of food. Went to this place on a whim - my brother was in town and wanted something light, but still with a southwest flair. This fit the bill very well!

The ambiance is very southwest without being kitschy. White walls, dark beams, saltillo tile floors, a wandering mariachi band, great mexican and southwest decor items. There are menus in both english and spanish. Beers are served cold in a tin bucket with ice!

Our waitress was very nice and extremely patient - she did not speak a lot of english and spoke even less spanish! Thankfully my brother is fluent in spanish and saved the day - otherwise I have no idea what I would have ordered. 

I had the shrimp and crab enchiladas - they were sublime. Flavors were good and the sauce complimented (not overpowered) the seafood. My brother had the shrimp diablo - it looked delicious and fiery! Chips and salsas were fresh and plentiful. 

I saw other tables ordering the ceviches - they looked amazing (but I am just not a fan, personal preference). 

It was a really enjoyable experience and I would recommend this restaurant if you are looking for tasty mexican food that is an introduction to the coastal part of mexican fare.
