JMwwxARF34aR1aq7hzpiJQ I had lunch at Las Popusas. My first time there with two ladies from the office. It is a great Salvadorian lunch spot. No bells or whistles it just about the food. You can not beat it as a value proposition. The server was friendly and our order was prompt and very tasty. I had two pupusas. One beans and cheese and the other with chicken. I enjoyed them both. Again this is not fancy place but if you are open to good lunch spot this is it. We all had two popusas and a drink total bill just under $25.00
