bAm70Bl8QoseFkUAU0mnSw I had another new addition to their menu, the Taquitos de Pato - the duck friggin' tacos - the word "friggin" is traditionally silent in the spanish name of this dish. Served up in four corn tortillas, sided with beans and an optional duck sauce - much to the disappointment of everyone else in the restaurant, I didn't yell out "Barbara Streisand" after each bite.

Beans and a "Salsa Endiablada" - which means "Devil's Sauce" to accompany the tacos. The beans were straight up beans, boiled down to a basic Mexican frijoles but the sauce is what stood out. All mole sauces are "secret recipes", using a mixture of herbs and spices that can go upwards of over 30 different kinds, the recipe reads like Lindsay Lohan's toxicology report only Itacate's mole sauce doesn't include gasoline, old boots and pigeons.

The duck meat was fragrant, herby and had the unmistakeable and aroma of duck. Classic Mexican flavours, the taco when topped with beans and table habenero salsa, complimented the dark and murky sauce and really brought the dish together. I'm hesitant to say that the salsa endiablada is an acquired taste, but it does need some getting used to.
