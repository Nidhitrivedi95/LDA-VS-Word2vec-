FxEJjLZj6UdsOCGcgEufeA We've been searching for a good Mexican bakery and have finally found it!  I decided to try some of their pastries for my office's Cinco de Mayo party and couldn't have been happier.  It reminded me of my childhood visits to Mexico.  The quality was as wonderful as I remember.  

They have these pig-shaped cookies that taste just like snickerdoodles.  I highly recommend them, along with their great variety of other cookies and pastries.

I haven't tried the tamales yet but plan to soon.  The pan dulces are delicious and I can't wait to go back to try more.
