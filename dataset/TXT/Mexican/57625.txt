a8pmtlVKf7NiSLI-4KejIw Decided to try this out before a Yelp event.  Oh m - how delicious!  We decided to get a few plates to share - the lobster/shrimp tacos were delicious and spicy and saucy and just everything nice!  The chicken burritos were ok...a little small for being share plates.  We tried the guac and chips and I think I died and went to heaven.  It was so fresh and light and just like heaven on a chip.  It really makes the supermarket guac go to SHAME.  

The drinks were lovely, the decor is stunning.  In the summer they have the patio section open in the front, which is pretty huge so I can't wait to go back and try a few things from their menu.

We did try the fried crickets (yes they have them as an addition)..you can get them smashed into your guac, which is what we did and it added a nice crunchy texture to it.   For the Distillery District this place is pretty cheap so I will definitely make a run back - maybe for brunch this time
