oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ A couple months back, I was in town for just a little and decided to give Chayo a try.  The food and drinks were pretty good but I have to say the highlight of the night was the resident magician.  Magic Mike made what would have been a normal uneventful evening into a memorable experience.  I will definitely be back to see him when I'm in town
