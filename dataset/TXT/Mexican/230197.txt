sH3UsolKjik01u0HlQ9_0Q Living in upstate New York, funding good Mexican food is tough. Visiting Charlotte, I was ready for Mexican food. Three Amigos delivers in a big way. Good enhiladas, guacamole, chips and salsa make this place a hit. The green enchilada plate was great with shredded chicken, a tasty verde sauce, avocado, lettuce, tomato and cotija cheese. Wish there was a place like this in New York.
