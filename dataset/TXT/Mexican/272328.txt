WTGmtvIE1v9uEBZxiyXImQ I had a lovely time here tonight at Maizal. The server was super nice and friendly and the patio was perfect for the beautiful weather. 

We got the guac, frijoles and tortillas to start and it was delicious - the guac was made fresh and the frijoles were warm out of the oven with a cheesy top. I got the Chorizo Tacos which came with a side of black beans, a generous bowl of warm chorizo and cheese, and three corn tortillas. As another yelper said, you can definitely tell the corn tortillas were homemade and taste the corn too. 

Will definitely come back to try the fish tacos which are only available on Fridays.
