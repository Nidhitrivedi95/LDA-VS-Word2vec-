Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ I went with a huge group (20+) for a friend's wedding early on Saturday night (5pm).  Their service was impeccable.  Really helpful and on top of refills.
The chips and salsa were delicious and they keep you swimming in them (bonus points for that!)
I'm a vegetarian (really a breadatarian) and for me the food was ok.  I had the chile relleno, cheese enchilada and beef taco (gave to my meat-eating friend).  It was all fine but for $20+ a meal I was disappointed.  It's a beautiful restaurant, gorgeous wood carving in the back, and maybe the meat and alcohol make it worth the price for others but for a Prohibitionist vegetarian not really worth the moola.
