That's perfectly fine - except when you arrive and they're standing around asking whose job it was to check the online orders! This occurred more than once at the same location. And yes,  they will sit around and argue about whose job it was before they get moving.  
They are stingy with the protein and very generous with the rice. We ordered extra meat for an extra fee and still ending up with a white rice burrito with about two tablespoons of meat... Seriously. And that's after waiting an additional 30 min for them to make the food because they were bickering about whose job it was to do so.
I hadn't realized how ridiculous they were being with the portions of protein that they were serving until I tried a burrito bowl at a different location. At the Nellis location,  I ordered a burrito bowl with no rice and extra meat. It barely created a mound big enough to rise above the sides of the plate. I ordered a burrito bowl at the location near town square mall and I couldn't finish it in one sitting. The Nellis location is fairly new and it already needs an overhaul.
