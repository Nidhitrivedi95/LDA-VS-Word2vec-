rCJ6qFo_liwGPzbupkLhhQ I just moved into this area in December 2012 and met "Nita Margarita" out shopping.  She encouraged me to at least try La Pinata because I was looking for that ultimate in Mexican food.  As I drove into the parking lot I was a little skeptical but, once inside, it was quaint, albeit a little too dark.  Using my flashlight app (yes it was that dark), I spotted the guacamole which is my absolute fav.  Our waitress came and took our drink orders and left.  After some time she returned with our drinks and started to take our order.  I asked for a side of guacamole to go with the chips as I cannot eat salsa.  We both ordered and waited...and waited......and waited.  No guacamole, nothing.  The place was not crowded or I would have taken that into consideration.  After about 20 minutes our food arrived so I again requested the guacamole.  About half way through my tostada, the guacamole came but by then we were out of chips.  The tostada was absolutely delicious and, once I did get my guacamole and chips, I enjoyed those as well.  Even though the food was really good, I have been to other good authentic Mexican restaurants that had much better service.  I am generally very postive but this hour long meal just did not set well.
