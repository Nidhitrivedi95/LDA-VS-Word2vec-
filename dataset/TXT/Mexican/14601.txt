0xtBEP5zCu1153SoqqemLw It has been quite a while since we have been here, and my husband was craving their tacos. He remembers how fresh the food was, and made to order. 

Sure enough, our food was made to order and came out steaming hot. I love that! We got two tacos pastor, and one carne asada. The homemade tortillas were really good. I love the slight sweetness from the pineapple in the pastor. They were not overly seasoned, and tasted great. 

We were given warm tortilla chips and one salsa. The salsa was rather bland, but I could not stop eating the chips anyway. The fountain drinks were out of order, and there was no horchata. Bummer there, but they offered us canned soda or bottled water instead. 

The tacos were hot, tasty and fresh. The ladies working were very friendly. From the outside this places does not look the greatest, but the food is worth the visit.
