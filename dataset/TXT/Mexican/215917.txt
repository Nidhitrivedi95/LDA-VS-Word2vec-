r1e5Ot6_jGFyV2N_dn8JDQ My wife Sylvia Q. stumbled upon this place when we first came to the desert back in 2004 when we hardly knew our way around town and discovered one of the best Tortas de Carne Asada being served in this little hole-in-the-wall bakery.....BAKERY!?!?!?!

Yup this bakery is also a taqueria, pupuseria, and pizza joint all in one!

You can get Mexican and Salvadoran style breads and pastries here, as well as pupusas, pizza, tamales, burritos, tortas, tostadas, sopes, quesadillas, pizza, wings, and the list goes on and on....


Fast forward 6 years later, and we happened to be around that side of town, so we go and see if that little bakery is still up and running.

Sure enough, they're still in business, so we go in and grab a table and order a couple of Carne Asada tortas. We see that they have Menudo(Tripe) as a special of the day, so we get an order as well.

when our order arrives, it is just like it was 6 years ago, Toasted bread made in house everyday served with a very generous piece of carne asada(not chopped up into little pieces like other taquerias) beans , lettuce, tomatoes, and jalapenos.

You gotta grab this thing with both hands to get a bite, its the biggest torta in town! Our 
Menudo is equally tasty, not gamey, and seasoned well, and comes with HANDMADE tortillas-YUM!

we also got some pan dulce and a chocoflan to go but they weren't all that. Marianna's is much better.
Haven't tried any other savory stuff, but the Torta de Carne Asada is worth coming back for...ALOHA!!!
