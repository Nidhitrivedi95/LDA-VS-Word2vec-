eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw Ordered Chicken and steak fajita servings where very good.Fajitas came hot and sizzling and tasted Great!!! Also ordered side of Queso that came with warmer to keep cheese dip hot! Chips we're light and crispy hint of salt but overall the meal was Good services was Good. But the prices of food was expensive for Mexican food.
