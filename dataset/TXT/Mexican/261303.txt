VtgFuz3LXsrGB-SzPSQbDg Are you looking for something original, unique and amazing, then you have found it.  Went there for the first time today for lunch and will be heading back on my next available Saturday to have the ribs.  Had the green chili shredded beef burrito which was already described here as a soupy mess.  Spot on description and I agree it was very good.  Wife ordered the burnt ends thinking it was a sandwich but pretty much got a plate of the stuff which was fatty and melt in your mouth tender.   Surprisingly very good.  After I ate mine I helped her finish hers.  Outdoor seating only.  Staff very friendly.  Make sure you mention it is your first time and they might have a little something for you to try.
