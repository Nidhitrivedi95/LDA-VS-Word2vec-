Yelp also offered a free margarita, but I decided to save that for later since it was $6 margarita time. The margarita was very tasty too. Their plates and decorations are nice. I kept staring at the walls and all over for the next cool design. Service was great and appetizer food was yummy. We had tacos and empanadas. I will be back!
