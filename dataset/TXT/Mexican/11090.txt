Our drinks came out real fast and they have complimentary chips and salsa.  Their hand made tortillas are really really good and they go great with their choriquezo.  I also had the caldo de camarones and it was good, it had good flavor but I would just suggest that they add some veggies to it... maybe some carrots and green beans??? It was still good though.  Would definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas.  Great all around.
