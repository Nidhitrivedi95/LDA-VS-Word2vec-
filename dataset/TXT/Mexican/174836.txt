moZpwq1hNxC-uJRpfupOTA Visiting Phoenix, bi-annual "move the kid from the dorm" trip. Looking for a good Mexican restaurant, one that a local we were dinning with, might not have tried. Every one of them had mixed reviews. If there were ten reviews with five stars there were two whining about something.

We chose the Carlsbad Tavern because there were good reviews about the food, great pictures, and the service sounded exceptional. The deciding factor was that the manager responded to almost every post. I hate writing these when I don't think anyone is reading them.

Several reviews raved about how wonderful a server Hannah was. After we were seated I asked my server if she was Hannah. She was not. I let her know that she had some mighty compelling Yelp reviews to surpass. Kristen did more that surpass them. She was pleasant, fast, attentive, helpful and above all smiling.

I promised to let this be known, and to clue everyone in that Hannah ain't got nothing on Kristen. Now, having not met Hannah, I will not assume that she is anything less than the reviews suggest. We look forward to returning, and giving her a run as well.

Oh, and the food was good as well. Definitely try the skinny margarita.
