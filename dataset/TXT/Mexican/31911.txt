The food was amazing! all you want from mexican. full of flavours. nice, casual atmosphere. Service was a little slow, since they just started the business. Definitely coming back.

I ordered:
Salsa, guacamole

5/5       1/2lb costillas de cochinita (pork) $16 - my fave of the night! oh man! that hot sauce was so hot, but so addicting! bald flavour! 
4.5/5    1/2lb Plolo Rostizadotop $14 - my second fave of the night. very different flavour from the  costillas de cochinita. the chicken was juicy and tender. all the spices work out well in a harmony.
4.5/5    Ceviche $9 - nice and refreshing
4/5       1/2 lb Res En Salsa Verde(beef flank). good dish with good flavour. but sorry, the pork and chicken were too good!

Sangria $7 - all you want for the night.
