moZpwq1hNxC-uJRpfupOTA Decided to try this place out a few years ago and it has since become a bi-monthly habit.  This place has a great Happy Hour that starts at 2pm.  The Filet Mignon tacos are phenomenonal!  3 large Filet tacos with a cup of beans for $8? (How can they do that) Plenty to eat at a great price.  The Staff is very friendly.  Neal and Art always provide a friendly greeting and check on you later to make sure all was good.  Tyler, the Happy Hour Bartender always provides 5 Star Service.  You can't miss him as he looks like the "Justified" Actor, Timothy Olyphant.  If you're looking for a great happy hour where you can eat and drink well at an awesome price with a great staff....Check it out.  Oh yah, the chicken quesadilla is ridiculously tasty, plentiful and only $5.
