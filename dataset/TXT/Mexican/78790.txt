cr84hpeFeas6N6VGV7Iu3A Awesome food  the Carne asada is amazing and the guacamole is sooo damn good. The only reason I didnt give 5 stars is the dessert. We ordered the fried icecream they call the La Bamaba. Its NOT traditional fried ice cream. They take a ball of ice cream and fry it in a pastry shell. well the problem is by the time the pastry shell is cooked the ice cream is melted. So you get a shell with melted ice cream soup and plantains inside. I would skip the sparkler in it too and try to perfect the food. Otherwise this place is amazing. We will be back many many times
