I3STZd5iAvUL9MNLF_DUug Totally in a hurry due to flight delays. Grabbed a short rib burrito to take on the flight, it was tasty! Shout out to the nice young lady with the short hair working the counter on 8/4/16 as she dealt well with my overall sense of "traveler's frustration", lol.

Would definitely recommend!
