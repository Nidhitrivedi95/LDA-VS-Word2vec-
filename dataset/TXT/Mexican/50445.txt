8WwGP-B3Zxh_03FxZ3gC-g Ordered a red menudo, omg was it delicious!! I love their birria but i was in the mood for some menudo. And its definitely a must try! The ladies here are super friendly. It kinda sucks its always packed but hey thats how u know its a great place with good food ! The place they got now is bigger tho so i give them that for having more space. I love it.
