d0aLkD3VQ3sijckod-oSDg I've been to the south side location multiple times and received better service. We chose to sit outside and we waited 15 mins at least to get a glass of water and meet our waitress. Very disappointed in the service at the north shore location.  Also they do not offer happy hour specials during game days. All around a bad experience
