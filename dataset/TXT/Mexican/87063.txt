Dj8MfG5-UGbjp9GxaNnGxQ Honestly, this was a really good experience.  The food was amazing, the drink selection (beer on tap) was great, the waiter was very competent, that atmosphere was pretty good.  Overall, it was alot more than I expected from a chain restaurant.  In the prices were very decent.  I will be back.  Also, I heartily recommend the caramel churros.... :O
