vGDhK2Lc4Np5iZYZ7FG0QA AMAZING!!  The owner and her staff are the happiest, friendliest restaurant folks we've ever encountered and we're in the business 40+ years ourselves. Her food is perfection!!  When we told her that she hugged and kissed both of us and then later sat with us for a few minutes. Very rare to find someone so passionate about their craft. 

We ate quesadillas de pollo and huitlacoche, a gordita de requeson and red and green tamales. Each was better than the one before. Chicken and steak are grilled and so super tasty. The steak has a little crunch from the griddle. Mmmm. The guacamole was warm and smooth with a kick of fresh jalapeño. Insanely delicious!!

$3 margaritas and $1 off beer during happy hour. 

The prices are beyond reasonable. They should be charging more. 3 beers, 2 margaritas, an appetizer plus the food above all for $43. Unbelievable!!

We will be back often and with everyone we know.
