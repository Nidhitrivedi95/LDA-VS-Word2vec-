knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw This place used to be good. The last time or two I've watched it go downhill. The hostess was swearing because a waitress offered us a table by the bar (we were in a hurry and asked for a two top) even though she said no bc they are for tables of 4 or more. The food was lack luster, our waitress didn't care or offer drink refills. I spent the rest of the evening with a stomach ache and eventually up chucked my meal. Fun- what a waste of money!
