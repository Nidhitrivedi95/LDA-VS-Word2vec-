Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ 5-stars for the duck hash and amazing service!!

I originally heard mixed reviews about Tableau due to their small portions, but I am so glad that I decided to try it!

AMBIANCE: This restaurant feels like it's designed for the upper class. I felt like I should have been wearing a summer dress and sipping on English tea. I liked the design of the restaurant, with the large windows for a view of the outside.

SERVICE: The service was great and they were so accommodating! They had a vegetarian/vegan menu for my boyfriend. After he ordered the vegetarian eggs Benedict, our waitress mentioned that the English muffin had eggs in it and asked if he'd like to substitute something else for it. I know it's typical for restaurants to ask that, but I think most would forget those little things. I was very impressed at how accommodating they were.

FOOD: The duck hash was amazing! The pastry layer on the bottom was so yummy and everything just complemented so well. The roasted tomato hollandaise made everything so delicious, and there was actually a lot of duck. It was also the perfect portion for me. I am definitely coming back for it.

I also tried my boyfriend's vegetarian eggs Benedict and was impressed as well! The veggie patty was really good, along with the scrambled tofu and hollandaise.

The portions are on the smaller side, so you might want to order sides. Regardless, the duck hash is a MUST TRY!
