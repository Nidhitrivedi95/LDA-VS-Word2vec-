o5Mofj5KJkYAMs_fhxftpg Seoul Taco is very unique.  The concept for the restaurant came from a food truck show on Food Network that features a blend of American Mexican with Korean flare.  The Seoul sauce is wonderful and gives a little heat to go along with the spicy pork burritos or tacos.  The gogi bowl is a different take on most burrito bowls featuring rice, eggs, green onions, meat, and kimchi.  The product is consistent but the interior comes off dirty and the music is too loud for conversations.
