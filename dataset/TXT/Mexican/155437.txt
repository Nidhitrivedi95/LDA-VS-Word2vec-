K6MBwTYeuLH0VsTVCLVgxg SO SO GOOD. First, I love the decor of the restaurant. It's so different and fun which creates a nice environment to be in. We ordered the Baja fish tacos, the pork with pineapple, and beef tacos. It was SO good. Our favourite was the pork with pineapple. The baja tacos doesn't come in 2 but it's because it's much bigger than the ones that do come in 2. We went around 12 and it wasn't full but still busy. The waitress and waiter was extremely friendly asking if we're enjoying everything etc. Up to when we paid the waiter looked at our bill and was checking out what we ate and what we can the next time. Love it!
