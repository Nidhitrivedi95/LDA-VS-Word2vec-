We started with ceviche and posole rojo, which is a great meat stew and it is perfect for the recent cold weather. They were amazing but what really hit home run for us were the tacos and their drinks. We tried both tacos crujientes (crunchy tacos) and tacos de la calle (street tacos). 

Beef tacos cruijentes - a solid hard shell taco packed with meat, fresh veggies and a little bit of kick. 
Pork belly - juicy and flavorful. the kimchi topping, which is not your typical red kimchi but more like a pickled white cabbage, is a great touch. 
Blue crab - a great solid crab taco. I love the avocado mousse they use on this taco. it was my friend's favorite.
36 hour braised beef short rib - super soft and lot of flavors this one! My husbands favorite but must warn you, it is spicy!
korean fried chicken - I didn't order this one mostly because I'm korean and was afraid that my love for korean fried chicken would make me a harsh food critic. But my friend who's tried it said it was amazing. I'll have to give it a try next time.

As for drinks, they have an amazing drink selection - beer, wine, spirits.. you name it. I don't remember the names of all of them but we each had at least 3 cocktails because they were delicious. Also got to try the best mezcal I've had so far per the owner's recommendation - Crema de Mezcal. Lightly sweet and very smooth. 

To top it off, everyone at the restaurant was very attentive and provided top-notch service. I recently moved out here from LA and my husband and I've been looking for our go-to spot. This place might be it for us. Service, food, vibe - Crujiente Tacos has it all.
