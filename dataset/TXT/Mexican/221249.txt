rl137V_5Hx0cJAV4beVdhA Moved to Toronto recently and I've been trying every taco joint I can find; Campechano is in the running for the best so far! Every single taco I've tried has been flavourful and delicious. 

My all time favourite taco is Carnitas, and at Campechano, they have a good one, just happens to be a bit too salty. If the chefs are reading this, please tone the salt down by 1/3, you'll have one of the best Carnitas taco in the country if you do! 

Having said that though, the lamb leg taco was amazing. With the Pescado, you can't go wrong. So far every taco I've tried has been yummy! Definitely coming back, especially to keep checking that salt level of the Carnitas :p
