XNWXyFgCGaAwvg9QML2Ypw I have tried their potato taquitos, nachos, salads, fries, and margs. The fries are waffle style and have been my favorite - come with a nacho cheese and spicy type of ranch for dipping. Everything else is pretty typical for a chain. Mad Mex is fun for the ambience and drinks, but otherwise nothing too spectacular. I usually have good service there. On Thursday-Saturday nights you can expect a short wait as this seems to be a popular spot. They have valet parking - otherwise parking is difficult in this area.
