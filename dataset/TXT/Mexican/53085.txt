9LZnA-r7GmdGmh-UPi8o5w I absolutely love this place!

I am so impressed with the quantity and quality of food here. I must admit, I didn't have high hopes for this place. I thought it would be a "greasy" but quick dinner. I was WRONG.

I ordered a veggie burrito filled with black beans, brown rice, all the veggies, and lots of cilantro. I was excited that there were rice and bean options. The healthy part of me lit up when I saw that everything was being made fresh. My boyfriend ordered the chicken burrito with all the fixings. We also bought 2 drinks, and our total came to about $22. Not bad.

We sat down, and were ready to indulge. I picked up my burrito, and could not believe how heavy it was. I was kidding, saying that I could use it to bicep curl, and burn off some calories before I ate it. We are huge fans of getting lots of food for our money (who isn't?). So a large portion was a definite plus, right off the bat.

Then I ate it. Holy Moses and sweet baby Jesus. It was delicious. I swear, there was a little Mariachi band playing in the background as pinatas were bursting and fireworks were going off! Mind. Blown. My boyfriend felt the same way.

I was actually sad when the burrito was finished *tear*.

The only minuscule downside of this restaurant is that the food takes longer to make than you would expect a "fast food" place to take (although, I'd argue that it shouldn't be classified as fast food). However, knowing that the wait was due to everything being cooked fresh made it easier to sit through. And let me tell you, it was worth it!

I'll definitely be coming back here over, and over, and over again!!
