yGg7O0ATbMzoxrLvByzp2g To begin, my girlfriend and I went to Elixor for our anniversary after hearing good things about it. When we arrived, there was a 25 minute wait, which actually passed much faster than that. The hostess was very polite and even though it was rushing, showed genuine care towards the customers. 

When we were finally seated, we were greeted by an enthusiastic female waiter who let us know everything we needed to. Since we had already looked at the menu on line, we were both ready to order right away. I had ordered the bronzed salmon while my girlfriend had the spaghetti, as an entrée we took the cheese and spinach dip.

The dip arrived very quickly, and was fantastic. The only problem was the fact that the "pita bread" that came with it was as hard as a rock. The table next to us would stare at us every time they heard us chew down. Nevertheless, the dip made up for it, but I wouldn't order it again.

The salmon was alright, nothing special. The flavours were lacklustre and the sauce used on the plate wasn't the greatest. The asparagus was overcooked and the garlic potatoes tasted extremely plain. 

As for the spaghetti, it came with a mere 2 shrimp and was loaded with mushrooms. The spaghetti is also very thin, which coming from an italian background, we weren't used to. There was also barely any sauce, but we still made the best of it.

To sum it up, this place has great service but the food could be better. It might have just been our dishes, but it wasn't very enjoyable. The salads on the other table looked good though! Overall, it was an alright experience.
