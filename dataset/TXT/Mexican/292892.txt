yvqcZrHixuf_oIUW83xUcQ I haven't  had Macayo's  in such along time. I was kinda worried that it wouldn't be the same, but it was, I loved it!! The food was so good, the cocktails was everything!!! Our server Heather was awesome she helped us pick the best dishes on the menu. It was nice and clean, I'm proud to say that Macayo's is just as good now as it was back then:)!!!
