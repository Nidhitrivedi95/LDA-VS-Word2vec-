JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg As many previous reviewers mentioned, yes it is next to a gentleman's club but that is where the similarities end. There is a separate entrance and nothing inside the restaurant relates to a club. This is a Mexcan restaurant 100%. I loved the al pastor. I get those everywhere I can just to see who has the best and these were great. The rice was a surprising win. I'm not someone who talks about how good someone's rice is but the rice was packed with flavor, as much as rice can be without added ingredients. Our server was very knowledgeable about all of their foods and how they fit the GMO-free theme. There are many yelp awards in the restrooms and on the walls and you can tell why once you try the food. I was very pleased. If you are visiting Vegas, you have to try this place and el gordo. Both are highly recommended.
