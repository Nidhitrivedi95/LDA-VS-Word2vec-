Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ ROACHES! ROACHES!! Went to eat a late dinner ended up throwing up my $22 Nachos after a cockroach crawled across the floor next to my foot! Bus boy stomped on it and just left it there next to my table on the floor. Was totally grossed out!!!! The waitress tried to explain why because of the indoor/outdoor setup but that really didn't help with the dead cockroach on the floor still!! Called the restaurant manager the next day and all he did was apologized,..... totally disappointed in how the whole situation was handled including the manager. Didn't even comp our meal or anything.....bad ending to my birthday weeke
