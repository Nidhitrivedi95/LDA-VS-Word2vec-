**2016 Yelp  100 LV Challenge #3**

So supposedly this spot shut down for about a YEAR... & it was ALWAYS a place to get your grub on because it was 24 hours & this is where you go after dancing up an appetite at Encore or XS. So i dunno if this location is a bit bigger... but definitely a bonus that the tables & chairs move unlike the Charleston location where the booths are bolted down ahahahaha

The staff is just as quick & efficient i would have to say when it comes down to getting the tables cleaned & showing up out of nowhere w/ foil to wrap up my leftovers! =]

I thought that the food would be the same as the Charleston location... but it was different =[  I will unfortunately have to say it was not as good as the Charleston location.

1/2 AL PASTOR FRIES $6.00 - I wouldn't say i would order this again.... but it wasn't bad to try. I thought it was a bit dry... just not enough of everything for each bite of fries.

FLOUR MULA AL PASTOR $4.25 - this is my go-to when i eat at tacos el gordo, but i was bit disappointed w/ the flour tortilla because it wasn't as GREASY as i would typically expect it to be... me & the hubby assume maybe the flat-top needs a little more "dirtiness" breaking into. 

AL PASTOR TACO $2.10 - ALL-in-ALL i think the Al PASTOR needs a little more seasoning to it in general. I don't know why it would be so different from the Charleston location, but the flavor is just not as BOLD.
