YSYDJTCt5kzY2kKnLNGRiA The staff here is so friendly and on top of it! They are constantly doing a great job grabbing drinks, clearing the table and bringing chips! I love the fish tacos (they are so good ) one thing is I wish they didn't put beer in the beans or any alcohol, doesn't mix well and wish they had some regular Mexican beans. Love their margaritas so good and refreshing! Overall love coming here and will still keep coming (and wishing they would change the beans)
