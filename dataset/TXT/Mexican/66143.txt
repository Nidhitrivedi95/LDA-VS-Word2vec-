BEplfZTUzYwApjMUaOA12w This was a great atmosphere to be in, especially after a long day of traveling. I'm usually really picky with my mexican food but this place was great! I had these Carne Asada strips that were so tender and they came with some sweet corn tamales that were to die for! I can't wait to go back! Especially for those tamales!
