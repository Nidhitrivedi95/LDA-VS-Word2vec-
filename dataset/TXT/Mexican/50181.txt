8tCrCYuNfFrPEk27WbKi9w This was a new place for us and we loved it!  I ordered a couple of items i know and a couple that were new. One of the new items was the bread with cream cheese and jalapeño stuffed.  Soooo good!  Light fluffy and good flavor. The only item that was my least fave was the churro. It was too hard for my liking and the center was filled with dulce.  This place was clean and friendly service.
