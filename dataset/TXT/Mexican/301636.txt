Zv71mk1Ysq56xHzY0MWzUQ 2 words: chicken taco seriously the best chicken taco I think I've ever had! It has this jalapeño cream cheese filling in it and my mouth is watering just thinking about this  The only thing I have to say is the salsa is two . If you're a Mexican restaurant, I feel like you should have a decent salsa- but I'm with everyone else's reviews on their salsa- it's not good and tastes like ketchup. I would suggest coming up with a 2nd salsa and give the customers their choice of which salsa they want. And I also wish the drive through was open more hours(but I understand that they are small and don't have the staff for that) but all n' all- good food!
