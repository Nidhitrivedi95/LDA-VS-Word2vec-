I came here with a group that should have annoyed any wait staff. 15 people, coming and going, different cheques, some ordering food, some not. The staff could not have been more gracious and helpful. The patio location around the fire pit was perfect for a fall night. Drinks and food were great (albeit nachos are avant garde) for my taste.
