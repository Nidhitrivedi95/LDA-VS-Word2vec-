ndXuzuD4BpNIrm1I0nTsww 5 stars for this place???? ahh!!! Are you kidding me?? 

You can find much better Mexican AUTHENTIC food for the fraction of the cost pretty much anywhere. Don't let Chef Garces' name blind you from how this place really is.

4 bucks for each individual small taco. Chips and salsa is not on the house,which is common at other places. Also, where is the salsa bar? Not gonna find it here.

I get that they're trying to be more upscale and cater to the retired people and tourists. I get it. I knew this coming in but wanted to try it regardless since they're actually changing the menu up completely. According to the waitress, this location initially was doing very well due to Garces' name attached to this place. But after all the hype, they've been really slow. There were only two tables total when we were there. It was 99% empty.

Garces likes to place his locations in wealthier areas where a bunch of retired people live and I don't blame him. Case in point; he has another location in Palm Springs. But when an area like Scottsdale doesn't generate revenue, it's a a pretty bad sign, hence they're revamping the menu very soon. 

At the very least, I can say I was one of the last to try the soon to be "old menu", for whatever that's worth.
