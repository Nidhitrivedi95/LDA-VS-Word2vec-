X57f6FWZiwI1wOidPPhOrQ Dos Reales on Prospect is the ONE place to go in Champaign for amazing Mexican food. Don't even think about going to the one on University (well, unless you're on campus or the line at the Prospect one is ridiculous).

Why they're awesome? Everything on their menu is delicious and comes in ginormous portions! And those of you who can finish a burrito bravo in one sitting seriously deserve some sort of medal.

Also, Dos has SUPER fast service - your orders come out in like 5 minutes. I love not having to wait for food!!!
