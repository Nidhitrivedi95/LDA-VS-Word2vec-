XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg The atmosphere here is nice. This place is in the middle of Caesars & that itself is a maze to get through (especially after a couple drinks). I have eaten here many times. The first few times many years ago, I fell in love. The Cuban pressed burger!!!!! I don't need to say anymore about that other then...it's gone!!
I have had other dishes, but most recently the Mesa burger. It's really good, very juicy & large enough for a big appetite. Even though my favorite burger of all time is no longer available (hasn't been for years) I'll still come here as the Mesa burger is very good.

PLEASE BRING BACK THE CUBAN!!!!!
