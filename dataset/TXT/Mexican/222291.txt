RRtjC-KUE9vSbD09r6is2A Lets be honest - This is not a place you are going to come because of the awesome food and decor. 

We went twice in the week we spend in Scottsdale and both times had phenomenal and fast service. The patio had a great atmosphere with everybody socializing and you definitely can't beat their happy hour menu ($4 margaritas, yes please!)

The food is bar food, so don't come searching for one of the best meals of your life. However, the servers kept our chips and salsa (yum) well stocked and the table side guacamole was great. 

I believe this will be our hangout for many more spring trainings to come.
