C2BR0TjNacoNzItPLUHTAA Our second time here, yay!

These people are an interesting mix of talent, and somebody really did a great job hiring. Congrats. 


Kristen (on the left) and Chelsea (right), waiting timidly for the next customer. 

This is their normal pose at the counter.  
They are required to be amazing and fun to work with--or else!


Full of energy and charm, Chelsea knows the menu well, and this crew really take care of business.

This reflects well on the ownership when their people, who work day in and day out, make their customers feel appreciated and important.


I had the fish tacos again, and two of them were plenty filling. Fresh, with nice fresh chunks of mango. Tasty stuff. 

no matter how big or fancy anyone thinks their business establishment is, and whatever business you're in, the only activity that really matters is getting, and keeping customers. 

Nothing matters more. 

#1 Getting. 
#2 Keeping. 

This is a must-visit.
