GUsYtGG557XKlHaMH87erg One of my first or few Mexican experiences in Phoenix that are actually authentically enjoyable. 

Entered there for early lunch and not very hungry which is not a good sign for lunch place reviews. Ordered a shredded beef tostada and a beer at 11.30 :). They have a nice selection of Mexican beer. Have to ask if they make Micheladas. 
Tostada was buried in salad but was good! Especially because of the salsas they have in the amount that you want. Their green salsa - salsa verde was very good. The red ones I would definitely improve and chill a bit more. But it was so pleasant experience and I felt like in the right place. 
Wanna try also their fish tacos next time. 
 And I just wanted to shop at Safeway :). Good for me:)
