svdEhLmNmpVaIv1WLtoOvQ This wonderful place never fails to make my mouth happy. We always puck and share the different tacos. I would say that the shrimp and Carina's taco choices are hands down my favorites. 
The crunchy beef is interesting as it has mashed potatoes in it. Tasty and one of the people in our group would say it's her favorite.
The beer!! Oh it's great. I love sitting at the bar with chips and their various hot sauces....just trying all the different types on tap. I think it's usually 20 awesome unique types...the bartenders are always helpful in choosing different types based on personal preferences of the consumer.
I go at least once every time that I'm in Las Vegas.  They have never dissapointed.
