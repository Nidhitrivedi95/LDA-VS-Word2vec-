Pros: 
 - Handmade tortillas! Yes! You can see the lady actually making them right in front of you while you order.

- The fam all ordered asada tacos and they were really good. Lots of flavor and they add guacamole. They don't skimp on the meat either!

- They have a fountain machine so that's convenient. 

- Prices are pretty decent considering their location.

Cons: 

- Line was long consistently.

- Not much seating. Mostly inside with a few outside. 

- When we first went in, the whole place inside was so smokey that the employees had to open up the doors to air it out. So watch out asthmatics! 

- There's no salsa bar! They have a bar for lime, radish, etc., but no salsa and I was not going to wait in that line again. 

Overall, I think the pros outweighed the cons. I'll definitely be coming back! You
