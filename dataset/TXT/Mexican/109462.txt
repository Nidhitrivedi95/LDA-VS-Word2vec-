FTo64sohiSRBRM9e9NzeAQ Stopped in for margaritas and was surprised to learn they only serve bottled drinks.  They did serve beer and a bottled margarita but it was a little odd finding a Mexican restaurant sans Margaritas, lol.

Since we were already seated we stayed for a drink & chips/salsa. 
My friend had the bottled margarita which she said was ok. I ordered a Michelada which was delicious and perfectly done! 
Salsa was flavorful but can't say I was a fan of the chips.

Would return to try the food, even without tequila!
