OlA7h9oOttqTALudvEUzTg I had Gloria's veggie tacos and a pepper and cheese tamale--so good! I love vegetarian tacos with cilantro and onion; these did not disappoint--nopales and queso fresco added a depth of flavor (and ingredients you don't often see in MSN). 

My boyfriend got a Michelada and said it was one of the best ones he's had in Madison. They use camaronazo and garnish with Tajin--I tried a sip and also agree it is top notch.

The owner/manager was super friendly, gave suggestions, and checked in to make sure we were happy. 

Plus they had Liga MX on TV--always fun to watch football highlights. 

Nice to have another family owned Mexican restaurant in MSN.
