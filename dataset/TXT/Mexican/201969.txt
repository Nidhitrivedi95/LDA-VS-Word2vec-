plHKBwA18aWeP-TG8DC96Q Went there for lunch on March 18th.  A little difficult to find, but worth it!  Waitress was friendly and attentive.  Food was great.

Chips were out of this world.  Queso was amazing as well.  Table next to us saw us chowing down so they ordered the same.

We both ordered veg tacos.  I added brisket.  It was good.

Cannot wait to go back to try more!
