-uqIK0vIzD_7PrnCgwhlHA Came here to fill a burrito fix since there's nothing else nearby, and was extremely disappointed.  We walked in around 7:30pm on a thursday and there were hardly any ingredients left, with a TON of fruit flies everywhere.  Of the ingredients still available, nothing looked fresh.  Only noticed this after we ordered and paid, as the ingredient station is around the side.  Have to admit... very weird process - noodles?  And once the burrito was made, had to wait about 10-15 minutes for it to just be grilled.  Overall, will not be back again.  I'd rather drive an extra 20 minutes to a chipotle.

If Golden Burrito staff are reading - please get rid of those fruit flies!!! Can't be good on the health and safety scale to have at least 2 dozen flies landing on and flying around your open "fresh" ingredients.
