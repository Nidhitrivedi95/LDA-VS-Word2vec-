woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ Awesome place. Had the polo asada and the bistec. Both were really good but the bistec was fantastic! Chips and salsa was also solid. Definitely would recommend getting a reservation. We lucked out, walked up when they cancelled someone else's reservation & got seated outside right away.
