-xIrVu_7prj_0GDl1tds1w I give places 5 stars based on: did I love the food, and would I come back again? Yes and yes for this dope little taco place 

I like Los Dos more than Mucha Lucha because of its proximity to my office, and I hate the line at Mucha. Ive had the asada tacos, chicken tacos, and the asada burrito--all very tasty and well portioned. The hot sauce is really good: the red isn't runny like other places, and the extra hot green is creamy and super good on the asada. It's definitely since gotten spicier since my first visit, as I formally would have called it "white people spicy". The extra hot green def lives more up to its name this time around. 

If you're starving, go for the burritos or if it's Tuesday, get the 99 cent tacos. 5/5 will continue to come here for lunch when I can
