When we ordered drinks off the menu, the bartender came to inform us they didn't have some of the ingredients, then proceeded to state the drink is sweet enough without. That's a small insult to those who create the menus, in my opinion. Unfortunately, there was little interest in the bartender to make up for this, even something as small as offering her expertise as a bartender to concoct something else for the other customer I was visiting with. Last issue was the price vs meal. For nearly $11.00 for a "Chicken Bowl", you're served a plate covered in lettuce and small portion of rice and chicken. This meal was nothing short from an over priced afterthought.  Sadly, this native New Mexican will not be returning.
