eSENXDnnNSo-MLLkWJQ8Vg Service here is absolutely awful! Expect to sit and wait 20 to 30 minutes just to order your drink. Today we waited for 30 minutes to be greeted only to be told that their register was down and they were no longer taking orders for the day. Had they told us that when we arrived, that would have made things much easier. Will not return again
