JMwwxARF34aR1aq7hzpiJQ Be prepared to wait a while here (15-20 mins for 3 pupusas, beans and rice) or call in over the phone so you're order will be ready when u get there. This is my 2nd time here, and they make the food as you order, so u get piping hot, fresh pupusas! U can see them making the dough, and forming them as you order. What I like are that they also have vegetarian pupusas, which most places do not, and if they do its just bean/ cheese. This place had "sucini" ones among others which is how they spelled "zucchini" and it was delicious! Also, prices are really great for what I order!
