ZAqgv1gply0m_4fHAIffWA Ate a quick lunch here since I was staying at the Palms. Being from Los Angeles, tacos are a cheap, tasty way for a quick meal. I realize this place is in the food court of a resort, but yikes, my wife and I each had two tacos, a coke and a beer, and the bill ended up being a little over $30. For what you get and the quality of the tacos, it's way overpriced. The asada tasted more like it was boiled and my wife said the pastor was dull and bland. My wife and I knew there was something wrong when they asked us what kind of cheese we wanted on our tacos. Cheese? Where are we, Taco Bell?
