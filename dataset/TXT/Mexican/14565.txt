When you dine in, they serve you with 2 types of salsas and chips: the bigger salsa bowl is a mild/medium flavored salsa while the smaller bowl is spicy salsa, which has a great amount of spice to it.  I'm pretty sure that's why they give you a smaller serving bowl incase you can't handle it.  

I've had their chorizo plate that comes with rice and semi-refried beans.  I like their refried beans because it tastes fresh, and it's not 100% mashed, so you'll still be able to see some beans there.  

There are some mexican places where they serve you a load of protein and beans with very little spanish rice.  Well, this place will give you a good amount of spanish rice to go with your plate.  

Last time, I got the carne asada plate for $10.  I was expecting some diced carne asada meat, but to my amazement, I got 3 decent size strips of carne asada.  Flavor was as if it has been marinating in awesomeness for a few hours.  I had a big plate, but the flavor was so good, I made the clean plate club.  I would definitely get this carne asada plate again!
