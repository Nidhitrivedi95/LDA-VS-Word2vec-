POgTu9ieZzOBafGMJ0MZow I was born and raised in the Southwest so I know my Mexican food and finding it in Ohio is HARD.
Mucho Buenos is the first place I go to when I am craving good Mexican food. I love that they have plenty of vegetarian options and their salsa is perfect. The staff is always incredibly friendly when I go with my family. I haven't been to too many Mexican restaurants (Chipotle doesn't count) that have meat alternatives (tofu) it would be nice to see possibly in the future!
