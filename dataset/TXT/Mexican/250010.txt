UJb1PrUWDFfuzwUPc1pP4Q Racist location. Went there on a game day. Had on usc gear and a pair of tennis shoes. Told me we cant get in because we were out of dress code because we had on tennis shoes. Ok no worries ill spend my money else where but you let white boys in with tennis shoes before us and about five packs after us. Save you money racism is alive. Look i didnt get 2 degrees to accept this kind of thing. Flip flops are ok but tennis shoes are not if you are black. If u have a dress code cool but if only for a certain look of person then thats racist.
