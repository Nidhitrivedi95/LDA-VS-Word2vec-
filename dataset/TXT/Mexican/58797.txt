agslgubMJJRFG9GGa00WtQ This place took 1/2 am hour just to take my order....only 3 cars in front of me. Taco Bell, not a fancy order, just tacos.  

When I pulled up they didn't greet or say anything, so I said hello and got a attitude with her response. I'll be with you in a moment. 

That moment took another 5 minutes before she came back on the speaker...pretty dumb. 

Last time I go here....
