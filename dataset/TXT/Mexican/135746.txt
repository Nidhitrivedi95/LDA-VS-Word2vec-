INzLc1Y0JNQzIHjPH2Nbeg Been here many times but this past week was disappointing.  Ordered taco combo plate with fried fish and shrimp and the fish look kinda strange, shaped more like chicken tender.  Took first bite and I noticed the meat was kinda hard and dry.  Informed guy at counter that I assumed was Manager, he had blue polo, that they might of made mistake with my order.  He tells me they don't make fried chicken tacos, well sir, I guess today you do now.
Showed him my order and he said they might of over cooked it and just walked away without even apologizing or offerinvvvg to remake.  Took another bite and there was no way it was fish.  Even if you over cook fish, it will not turn hard or chewy.  I work in the food and beverage industry for over 20yrs so I would know when something like this is wrong. 
Really disappointed that they made no effort to make things right.  Come on, what's the food cost on a fish taco, probably less than  $1.  And they couldn't even offer to remake one.
