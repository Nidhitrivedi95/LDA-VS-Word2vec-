lXE09qNzIeqgVLJGsylEXg We tried Lupe's today, excited for a new Mexican restaurant in Middleton.  

Food - we had a cheese quesadilla, chicken burrito, and a few tacos.  Everything was very tasty, nice assortment of meat choices and toppings.  If you like a little heat, I recommend their hot sauce as a topping on any of their dishes.  The mexican rice isn't anything fancy, but tasted good too as a side.   This is counter service like a Qdoba, not a sit down restaurant, but we liked the simple menu.

Prices - in line with what you would expect for a smaller Mexican restaurant, perhaps the taco at $2.25 is a steal based on the generous amount of toppings. 

Atmosphere - Like others have written, it is well decorated with bright colors and some fun painting on the wall.  The music was nice, the TV was a little strange as they had wrestling on which was interesting enough, then it switched over to some strange Mexican movie.

Opportunities for improvement - There are just a few things that need to be fixed up to get to 5 stars in my opinion.  One is that if you want some water to drink, you need to pay for it and get a bottle of water which is purchased from the nearby Copps.  There is no fountain soda service.  Also, there was very limited 4-top seating, almost all the tables were for 2 people though you could push some tables together if it isn't too busy.

Considering it just opened recently, the restaurant is on the right track and we will be back again.
