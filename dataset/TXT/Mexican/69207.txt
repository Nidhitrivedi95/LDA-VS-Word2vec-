I had the carnitas, which were very flavorful with nice little crispy bits and edges that gave it nice texture. My wife's carne asada was marinated and delicious. We also had the bean dip as an app. It was excellent and a nice break from a standard bean dip. 

The only things to nit pick about were the house salsa and the fact that your meals only come with one tortilla (the tortilla it self was great and obviously fresh). The house salsa is more like a hot sauce. It was just ok. They have another vegetable salsa that came with my food that was much better. 

We will definitely be going back.
