4KKmloORuH47OySm9Fq6ug Just horrible. Food is bland and expensive. Seriously Filibertos might be a better option than this place. 

Customer service: there is none! I don't know why they run a business. You ask questions and forcefully answer with no sense of wanting the clientele, its just strange. From the other reviews and the sign on the window stating to call to ensure they are open this place can be close whenever they want. Surprisingly they are still in business. Lol.

Food: bland. No taste. Nor the green nor res chile is good. Absolutely bad. Burritos are all tortilla no meat. 

I wasn't a big fan of Litos but they are much nicer folks and food is 100x better than this place.

FYI - don't be fooled. They have no affiliation to Rito's in downtown(that place is actually good).

Take it from me(been to countless burrito places) If you really want to taste something good for a chile burrito. Go to La Canasta on 7th ave and Buckeye Rd. Now that place knows how to make food.
