ZB7Vg9gOkgOKg0HImEH0AQ I'm a burrito kind of girl. I like them a lot. Unfortunately, Mucho Burrito is nothing to get overly excited about. 

Don't get me wrong - I've never had a 'bad' burrito from Mucho. But I've had a few 'so so' burritos from them...

There's just no magical 'wow' moment, you know? Luckily for Mucho, there aren't a lot of great lunch options in FCP.
