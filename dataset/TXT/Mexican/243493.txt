Whether you go on Mondays for cheaper tacos or any other night, the food is amazing and they also have a full bar. Steak tacos, fried plantains and a Dos XX is my go to every time. 
Parking is a little small so if you're planning on drinking, just Uber there so you don't have to worry about parking. If you do drive, there's a big parking stricture about 1-2 blocks away, so it's not too bad anyways.
