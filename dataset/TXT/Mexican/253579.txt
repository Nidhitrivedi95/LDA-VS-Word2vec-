UZ34XAw1GJ3chCOuKL69Mg So let me start with the note that the food was excellent. A family friend and I went to lunch and it was totally affordable! I had the cheese enchilada, beans, and rice. It was amazing and my friend was very satisfied with her meal. However, the service was AWFUL! We asked for salsa a few times because the salsa was amazing! Every time they came to our table they'd kind of "toss" or roughly slam the small bowl down. The woman who sat us and took our drinks was very soft spoken, when my friend asked what she said the woman scoffed and rolled her eyes and said louder and slowly like we were stupid. When our food came I was trying to make room and the waiter still went ahead and tried to put the plate down which burnt my arm. It wasn't a horrible burn it was more like a small ouch and a red spot that went away. After she burnt me and I jerked my arm away she slammed the plate down a bit rough and smiled at me and told me 'careful the plates are hot' and left. 
I work in retail and I understand some customers are irritating and can ruin your whole day but in the end customer service determines your customer flow. I definitely won't be coming back to this Garcia's. The food was excellent but didn't make up for the horrible customer service.
