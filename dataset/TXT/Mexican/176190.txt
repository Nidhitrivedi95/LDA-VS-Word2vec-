mqqpu_OBoaQmtA4wFfG-Yg Don't come to Z Tejas without getting one (or two) of their margaritas. 
Not only are they extremely strong, they're also delicious.  I think they only allow each person to have three total- that's how strong they are. 

You'll usually have to wait a bit for a table at this location. The entrance is in the mall, so it's always packed with shoppers any time of the day or night.

Since I'm a vegetarian, I often have to modify menu items that include meat.  It may sound weird, but I always get the chicken diablo pasta, minus the chicken and I ask them to add their mashed potatoes to it.  They put them right on top of the pasta and for some reason unknown to me, it's delicious. Quite the tasty combo if you will. The server will probably look at you very strangely if you order this, but it's worth it.  Give it a try!
