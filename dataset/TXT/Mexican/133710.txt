iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg Wow this place is busy but for a reason! I only eat halal so i got 1 gobernador, 1 blackened mahi mahi and 1 baja fish taco, each are $5. They were all pretty good, this wasn't the best baja I have had though. The gobernador was really flavourful however if your not into anything smoked this is not for you, luckily smells don't bother me so this was okay. My favourite was the blackened mahi mahi, it was the perfect combination and they have a sauce bar on the side. The only downside is I think 3 tacos were just a snack not really a meal and its super messy but definitely a cool place to try if you are in the Kensington market area.

*If its your first time here: Get the gobernador (if your adventurous) or the mahi mahi (if you wanna play it safe) as these are the most popular, if your thirsty grab a jarritos, order more if you want however the line is usually crazy :)
