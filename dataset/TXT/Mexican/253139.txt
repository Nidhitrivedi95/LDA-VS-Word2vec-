UXlEtuFrMu4YZKH9M2DRIw Rubio's is definitely one of my favorite Mexican restaurants and I have tried out a lot of them! Their dishes are a perfect combination of delicious and healthy! I usually get their California bowl and I add shrimp! It's looks, smells and tastes amazing and I don't feel guilty after I eat it lol highly recommend the place for a great and healthy lunch! Also, their staff is very friendly and kind
