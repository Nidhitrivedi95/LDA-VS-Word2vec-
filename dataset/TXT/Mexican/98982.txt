Es-MfCr79uHI-CSrzkea-w So, I ordered from this place on Grubhub, so I can't speak to the quality of the service. If it's on par with the food, I'm sure it's terrible as well. I studied the menu long & hard before ordering, and I was impressed that they had typical Mexican dishes you'd be hard pressed to find in other Mexican restaurants (chile en nogada? Heck yeah!) I read the reviews, but didn't take them too seriously. I ordered the cochinita pibil, a yucatecan dish of pork that's marinated in achiote, spices and citrus juices, then roasted in banana leaves. What I got was the Chata brand of cochinita pibil that you can find in a can or a plastic pouch in the "Hispanic food" aisle in Walmart. I'm not even exaggerating. For $15? That's a mistake I won't be making twice. Take the reviews seriously; stay away.
