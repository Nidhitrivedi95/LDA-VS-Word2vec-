TzpqNdtAZHXuIKf2xS0o2A I got what I at first thought would be a small portion of food turns out to be a moderate amount.
I got fish Baja tacos , nachos,  and cheese quesadilla. 
I got a little suckered into making the small  nachos into a deluxe nachos.
So it turned into quite a bit of food .
It was good ,  my friend and I both enjoyed the food. Even had to take some with me.
What do you expect from a chain food place
