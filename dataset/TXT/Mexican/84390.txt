d7MApy1gIfSYZzVzUUsf8A There is NO excuse for a restaurant to leave out food in an order. Period. Every.single.time. I have no idea why i return to this location... Other than convenience. Tonight I spent $24 to feed my family. I ordered 4 soft tacos, 2 hard tacos, 2 bean and cheese burritos w/o onion, 2 Mexican pizzas and a burrito supreme w/o onion. Of course they rush me off after a quick perusal of a dark paper sack. The guy even tells me "the ones with no onion are marked." When I get home, I have 1 Mexican pizza (there goes dinner for my 9 year old), 1 bean and cheese burrito (sorry 4 y/o! Forgot your burrito too) and the burrito supreme was accurately marked to have no onion. But alas it had onion... And TONS of it as if we asked for double onion. Sorry mom... You can have cereal if you want?? Ugh. I HATE you Taco Bell. Learn to review your orders or go work somewhere else.
