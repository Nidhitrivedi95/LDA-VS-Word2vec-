4LP1fINwJGhLXF2dWxz5nw I love Chipotle. But we just picked up food to go and the rice was so undercooked it was crunchy. The guacamole was so salty its inedible and my sons pork was so dried up it looked shiny. If that makes any sense. Honestly I think it must be sitting out from lunch in the hot container for a few hours. Such a disappointment when I know their standards for food are much higher.
