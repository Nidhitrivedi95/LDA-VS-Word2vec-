Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg Thank you Yelp Las Vegas for the recommendation. 

Showed up here after a day of walking and shopping and I have to say Julio, our waiter, is fantastic and made the experience a memorable one by making recommendations for my party; who are a bunch of newbies to Mexican food. 

The service was pretty attentive with our drinks being refilled and empty plates being whisked away without us asking or noticing. 

I orders the garlic shrimp; which was pretty good, bf ordered something chicken salitas (?); the other two in our party orders a chipotle chicken and carnitas. The carnitas were probably the winner, but not by much.  

The menu is a bit confusing, so if you get Julio ask him for help navigating the menu.  Do it. 

The table-side guacamole is pretty fresh and tasty too. It is worth the drive off-strip.
