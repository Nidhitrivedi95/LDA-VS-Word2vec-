BEplfZTUzYwApjMUaOA12w This place deserves 5 stars! Been coming here every time I stay at the Vemetian and I never miss a beat. The staff is so warm and welcoming, the food is amazing, and the drinks! If you sit in the patio area you are right by the waters so you see the gondolas go by with beautiful singing, kind of like live entertainment. Definitely check this place out!

My favorite dish is the Fajitas Trejanas!
