_WtxQbDK7B-ExGdeG-2j6Q Cozy and dim little restaurant with fireplaces and wine bottle storage all around you. They have very tasty happy hour bites that pair so nicely with the drinks they offer. Bacon wrapped scallops? Yes please. Carne avodava sliders? Hell yeah. Add a glass of red and you've got the perfect date. 

I've been here several times for brunch because it's great food and there is NO wait on the weekends. 

Their Huevos Rancheros con chorizo are knock-it-out-of-the-park delicious. And so much food that I was able to keep about half of it for breakfast the next day. All those delicious, yet understated, flavors all compliment each other so well. I was graced with a sample of their french toast, and it is pretty amaze also. 

Last time I was here, I tried the salmon benedict and was underwhelmed. It needed some sort of kick or maybe a heavy glaze on the salmon because the flavor combos were pretty bland. Since they don't have any hot sauces aside from sriracha, I was outta luck on that front. 

On a more positive note, you know it's gonna be a good mimosa when they ask "Do you want a little bit of orange juice, or a lot orange juice?" Honey, the mo' champs the better. She nods and says "I thought so!" Wine glass sized mimosas = yes. 

See you next time, Rokerij.
