wYSWgZMiMJxfusnxeWKYXg If I were to judge on the food alone, this place would have 5 stars. The food is exceptional quality! I ordered the Carne Asada Quesadilla and a cheese Pupusa. The Quesadilla had the perfect amount of cheese and steak. It was also grilled to perfection. The Pupusa came with a very mild salsa and a slaw. Both were fresh and flavorful. 
Now the service. I can't remember the last time I had such poor service. We had a young guy (probably the same one who has been mentioned in another review) who looked to be of high school age. I wish I could blame it on a language barrier, but we were with someone who is affluent in Spanish and who had no problem communicating with the server. He never came around to check on us after our food had been brought to the table. My fiancée ordered a Pupusa and some double fried tacos. After all the food was brought to the table with hers missing, we assumed the server had forgotten to enter the order. Nope. Apparently that dish just takes longer to cook, but our server never told us. To be honest, he looked like he had no interest in doing anything but talking to the girls that work there. After we were finished eating, it took 15 minutes for him to check on us and then to bring us the check. Tables waited on by the ladies did not seem to have these same problems.
We will go back for the food, but will request not to sit in his section.
