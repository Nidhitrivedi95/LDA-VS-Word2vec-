dwQEZBFen2GdihLLfWeexA Passed this place a few times and finally decided to try it. I got the #17 on the lunch menu. It was a burrito  with eggs, chorizo and cheese.  It was probably one of the most tasteless burritos I've ever had. It was covered in what appeared to be some sort of franks red hot sauce, and no im not mistaking it for enchilada sauce. The side of my plate was a pile of tomatoes shredded cheese and a piece of lettuce, a whole piece not shredded. Not happy with my lunch at all. The salsa and cheese dip were average, nothing to go crazy over. Service was quick and friendly. The food came out about 5 minutes after we ordered which kinda scared me. I like quick service, but also don't mind waiting a few minutes for some really good food. Overall the place was cute, people were friendly but food was less than OK. I wouldn't go back.
