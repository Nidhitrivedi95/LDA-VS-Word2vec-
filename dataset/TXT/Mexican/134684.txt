IiYY8e_I7wFt0xo5I-6GDA People have raved about this place I would not give it five stars the food was good but very greasy. We had the Mexicali platter which was enough food to feed and army however the meat was overlooked and dry.  The charro beans were excellent and the catacus was prepared perfectly.   If you can get through the grease then the Restuant is worth one more chance.
