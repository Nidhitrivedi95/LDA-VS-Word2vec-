L2iT7pipc455Tgpbo35_mw This place is a shit show! They literally sell buckets of alcohol to all the belligerent night owls in this tiny tiny establishment that is outside. It is 2 levels but super small, and sometimes they host block parties that get super crazy. That's the only reason I go here is to see sick djs. Otherwise I would not come. There's no bathrooms, people are over served, but the drinks aren't that expensive and there's a cool patio upstairs. It's just really really dirty and the crowd is annoying!
