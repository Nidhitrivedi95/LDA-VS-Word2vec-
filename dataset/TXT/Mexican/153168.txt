Typically, when you go out for Mexican you get a ton of food and typically need a box for left overs. I got 3 tacos and it was $15 for that and they were unfortunately very small tacos that didn't really hit the spot. Nevertheless, we enjoyed the atmosphere, and service. Would most likely go back and try something else that might offer more food.
