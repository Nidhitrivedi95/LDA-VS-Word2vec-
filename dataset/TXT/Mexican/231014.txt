sIZm6SbTVueFfswzo-a0hg Being from California, I thought this was some of the best Mexican food I had yet to find in the UK, until I was terribly sick with FOOD POISONING later that night. 

I came here with a friend on 31/12/13 for a quick, last minute dinner as all the other restaurants in town were fully booked. I ordered the chicken burrito and for £11 it was actually pretty decent. However I'm 100% positive that it was the burrito that gave me food poisoning about 6 or 7 hours later. 

Don't come to Mariachi if you can help it!
