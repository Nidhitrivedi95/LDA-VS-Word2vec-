qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A This cute little bistro is full of light and art as soon as you walk in the door. Brunch seems to be very popular here because the place was packed. I ordered an omelette that had green chili, corn, cheese, and so many more ingredients I forget. It was huge and bursting with flavors you don't normally experience in an omelette. Our waiter was extremely friendly and knew the menu well. All around us there were at least 3 people who had ordered the chicken and waffles, so my next trip here I will have to try that dish. I've always loved New Mexican food and this place brings a wonderful infusion with Jamaican as well.
