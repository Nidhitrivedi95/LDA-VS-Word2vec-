ZkUWOdBA4T7pdUhT0dkRzQ Barrio is a lot better than I expected. It was a bit pricey compared to most mexican restaurants, but the quality is very high so it is worth it. I just got a burrito and I was impressed and the quality of ingredients inside. I love the environment as well. The chips and salsa were also delicious. The portions are big. The server was very friendly.
