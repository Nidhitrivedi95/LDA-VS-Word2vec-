YauBkH-HEx148jC0pv4Hcg Wow...do I ever love this place!  We stopped in Saturday for happy hour and dinner and it reminded us how much we missed this place.  Love that they offer $6 glasses of wine for happy hour at the tables as well as the bar - I enjoyed a lovely Silverado Sauvignon Blanc.  We shared the spinach queso, green chile pork tamale, chicken, beef, shrimp and sausage skewers over rice and pinto beans and the shrimp and scallop pasta with a side salad.  We definitely overdid it, but couldn't decide what NOT to have...tough problem, right?  After dinner we went to the cellar bar at the Rokerij...perfect way to end an evening on a hot summer day!
