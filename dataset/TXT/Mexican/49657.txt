8ou6p7T-3KaNOhDeln3Ccg My family and I stumbled upon Fresco and I'm so glad that we did! The service is friendly and fast. The food is delicious. The restaurant is clean the atmosphere is really relaxed.I tried the queso with beef and I ended up eating it all and ordering one to go because it was so yummy. The guacamole is really good as well. This is weird but Fresco also has really good ice. I was really pleased with my meal and the prices were reasonable. I definitely recommend trying Fresco.
