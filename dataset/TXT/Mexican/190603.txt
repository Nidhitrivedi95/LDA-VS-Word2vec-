No beans, no rice, and apparently no fresh guacamole. The menu claims that the guacamole is prepared "table side". Instead I received what I would classify as a cereal-bowl-sized serving. This cereal bowl came out appearing to be thrown together at some point during the day (hopefully) and then tossed into the fridge until some ill informed customer orders this $12.50 "fresh" not fresh dish.

How can an airport in such a Mexican affluent area serve "Mexican" dishes over...fries...?
