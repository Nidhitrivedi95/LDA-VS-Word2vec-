lewN3yvie6jSbRNuyAV0GQ 4-15-2017 UPDATE  Family tried again twice at this store.  Ordered the triple double crunch wrap box and the non regular taco was different both times.  Still teeny tiny meat filling in the regular tacos. Out of Pepsi at 11:30 am.  Ordered 3 Quesaritos and they had no meat at all.  The menu is too big, the names too long, and the staff filling the orders don't know which is what.  I have absolutely had it with Taco HELL.

We are usually very happy with this store.  They are polite and fast and the food cheap and good.  But our last visit, the food-yuk!  Ordered a Fiesta Bowl salad.  Short on the stuffing in the bowl and tasted the bowl itself, it had a rancid and bitter taste (perhaps old grease, old shell?) Nasty.  Also ordered 5 regular crispy tacos.  There was LESS than a teaspoon of meat in each shell and very little cheese and no lettuce.  When we first opened them, we thought they had forgotten to fill the shells they were so flat and lacking ingredients.  Shame on you for cheating  your customers.
