REJPrXEZly4PDQNmiMGI8Q Robertos Taco shop being 24 hours is just brilliant!  They have wonderful fresh guacamole that I always order extra of!  The meat is always fresh and tasty, I also love their tortillas.  I have went all different times and whichever staff it might be are always friendly, the restaurant is always clean, and the food is always fresh!
