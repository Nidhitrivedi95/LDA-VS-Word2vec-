MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA Baja fish is not bad, the carnitas too, except well you can't really fuck that one up. Was it tasty? Yeah. Is it worth the hype? definitely no. The tacos are mini sized, I need at least 5 to feel full, expect at least 35 dollars per person. Taqueria food for tapas price is a Toronto thing, where we just settle for second class efforts. No need to talk about Mexico, any cheap Taqueria in mission and 16th in SF blow the "best in Toronto" out of water flavor wise, and there you leave full with less than 10 dollars spent.

The service was like "I don't really care", and that's exactly how I feel about this place too.
