eoGAZLu8HQXxCNJC86uPcQ I really love authentic Mexican food, so my hopes for this restaurant were high. Was I ever disappointed, the only thing on my plate that had any flavour was the Diablo sauce. Which was a pleasant surprise because I can take a lot of heat. Everything else was bland and flavourless.  The beans tasted like they came right from the can and the rice was very plain. The chicken tacos I ordered tasted like they have been reheated in a microwave, after living without one for almost 10 years I can taste the difference. The "salsa" that was served with chips before my meal came was just some crushed tomatoes, which made me really sad because I love fresh pico de gallo!
