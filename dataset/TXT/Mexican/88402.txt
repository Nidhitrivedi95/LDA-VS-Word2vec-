DMwU0igEs9K7XuI3utsr6g Went there today during a layover.  I ordered a frozen strawberry margarita and chicken quesadillas. Both were mediocre.  What prompts my one star is the fruit flies at the bar.  I was sitting at the bar and I saw 3-4 fruit flies at any given time.  Okay I understand things happen at the bar.  However, one of the bartenders then came over and placed something down under the tap and all of a sudden I saw a surge of 20-30 fruit flies fly up and I couldn't eat anything after that.  Flashbacks of every episode of Bar Rescue was flying through my head and I just wondered what their kitchen looked like in hiding if that's how dirty their bar was in public.  I won't be returning there during my travels.
