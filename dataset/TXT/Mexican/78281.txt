cMK38jKxH8x5PvFfAfjZmA Update-(reminds me of movie 'Mystic Pizza.') Just left Casa Flores after an excellent meal! Spent the day at Stewart's Point Lake Mead taking Christmas pics! Belly was growling. Once again, Kelly was our Ambassador! Great Team Work amongst team. Had the Margarita, excellent! Nachos & 3item combo platter. Free tortilla chips, bean dip & salsa hit the spot. Homemade salsa had excellent oregano flavor. Albondingas soup was very good although pasta is now elbow. Same med. well tasty albondigas! Nachos were very good. My chicken taco was good although that too has changed to premade Taco Bell style shell, wife did not like it. Son DJ had childs Quesadilla & beans, loved every bit. Definitely the best Mexican food this side of Arizona/California border. Again, stay away from Poncho's in Summerlin- YUCK!! Please bring back homemade taco shells. Chef Gordon Ramsey said it is the easiest most important thing to make in a mexican food restaurant otherwise we could all make tacos at home! Please mention Yelp reviews to keep'em honest. Carlos
