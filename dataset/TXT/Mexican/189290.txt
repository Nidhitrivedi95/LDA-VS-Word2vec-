oBABBuVRfIump4jHKlJmHg As a first timer, I had an overall good time. Definitely can't say that it's authentic Mexican dining, but an absolute fun and tasty experience.

Likes: The outside dining gave a more relaxed feel for devouring the food and being able to inhale some fresh air. Or for those who prefer indoor dining, the decor is very eccentric and odd to examine the modernized yet Aztecan influenced artworks. Mixed drinks were superb without it being over powerful or heavy to digest with food, even with or without the salt rim. The employers were real down to earth and friendly people, much props to them and their tiresome work. 

Dislikes: This place is heavily compact in space and too dark to dine later at night. Seatings were definitely too close for comfort especially not being able to hear your own conversations if you happen to be dining with company. Noisy atmosphere at times due to them being a hangout area.
