ehMxdQ9FfF4uOcGPKNWNOg So I went to cafe rio today to pick up just a simple quesadilla for dinner, which takes about 5 mins tops to make. There was only a couple in front of me and about 10 people "working" in the back. They all kept spilling things like food and cups and plates while I was watching. The total time I was in there from start to finish took 25 mins to get just my quesadilla. The couple order 1 salad and 1 burrito, which shouldn't have taken long either but they were out of just about everything and I had to wait (after they had already cooked my food and had it sitting ready one a plate) for the cooks in the back to make more chicken and beans. And again a million people working and they could have helped me but, what ever, that's not even the worst part. Here's the bad part, when they finally finished making this mans salad they spilled it on the floor, and I kid you not, the guy making it scooped it back up and put it in the bowl for the man to take to go. The couple didn't see this happen so I said something and asked if he really was going to not make him a new salad. The kid working there pretended like nothing hit the floor. At that moment I walked out and wasted 25 mins of my life. DO NOT GO HERE. I cannot believe they have an A grade in the window. They were dirty and careless. I am disgusted.
