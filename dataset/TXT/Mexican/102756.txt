Momocho created that experience for us.  

It's a restaurant I've been eager to try and, turns out, rightly so.  Everything from the zany lucha libre decor and lively energy to the prompt seating (we had a reservation) and upbeat, knowledgable and friendly waitstaff.  I was impressed from the moment we walked through the door.

Tom was our server and did well to explain the menu with his charm and playful personality.  My dining companions and I loved it and appreciated that he corrected a couple of drink errors he made by comping that portion of the bill, no hassle required.

But, the food!  Good gracious, it stands alone.  We started with margaritas (the cucumber & blood orange are a must!), plus one of their seven guacamole combinations (blue crab, corn, chile chipotle) and shared between us a variety of their signature taquitos: machaca, bistec, pescado and pato (I ordered the pato because they were out of the atun).

We all marveled at how well the proteins and sauce pairings went with each other. Each dish was a happy marriage of flavors (bravo, Chef Williams!).  My only teensy tiny complaint was that my duck was on the dry side, but nothing a little pomegranate ancho barbacoa sauce couldn't cure.

Momocho is another Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives winner!
