BIbjBxoiJLS8CnNsSP64TQ Don't go here!  Don't say that I didn't warn you.  I made the mistake of not reading the Yelp reviews before getting food here.  Just like the other reviewers have said, 360 Gourmet Burrito is like a wannabe low quality version of Chipotle.

You basically order your food at the register and pay for it.  Then you wait for your order number to be called.  The food came out really fast which is a plus, but I noticed that they had gotten my order wrong.  I ordered a steak burrito bowl and a chicken burrito and instead I got two burritos.  I told the guy who was working behind the counter that I ordered a burrito bowl and not two burritos.  He literally looked at the receipt and said, "Well, it says two burritos on here that's why I made two burritos."  I repeated to him that I ordered a burrito bowl.  He then repeated that the receipt says two burritos.  Oh hell no!  Are you for real?  I think he could tell that I was about to go off on him so he quickly said, "Do you want me to make you a burrito bowl then?" with a slight attitude.  I didn't want him spitting in my food so I just said that as long as I'm charged correctly then whatever, I'll just take the burrito even though I didn't order that.  Then the guy turned to his co-worker and yelled, "Stop taking the orders wrong!"  I know, hella professional.

I grabbed the food and took it elsewhere to eat.  The burritos were horribly wrapped.  Literally, the burrito was not covered completely by foil.  There was an opening with exposed burrito.  My bf and I had to bite into our burritos to figure out which was which since the burritos were not labeled either.

The burritos were tiny for being $10 each.  I understand that airport food is expensive, but these burritos were such a rip off.  Each burrito had like 5 small chunks of meat.  It was like I had ordered a vegetarian burrito.  The food didn't taste good either.  You're better off drinking your own saliva.
