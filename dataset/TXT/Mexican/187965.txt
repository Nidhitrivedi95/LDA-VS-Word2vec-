O3y-5O1n5l0ge_6KGyR_4A Wow I'm really impressed!!! I'm so glad I gave this place another chance. My last review was terrible, but years ago, and this place has improved greatly. I went in a first thing I noticed was they repainted the walls, which to me was a great sign because then maybe they were under new management. I'm not sure if they are, but my experience was much better this time around.

I went to the register to order and the guy who was the cashier was really kind. The team behind the counter seemed really close knit and worked well together, and quick! They were running around fast and there was only a few customers inside. I ordered a bacon breakfast burrito with extra cheese, and it only cost $5. Love it!!

I only waited literally 2 minutes for my food. It was done so fast!!! I was so happy cuz I was hungry! Lol so I got home with my food, and it looked so delicious!!! The bacon had a great flavor, not overcooked. The potatoes were delicious and tasted fresh. The eggs were cooked great and the cheese was on point. I usually can't finish it all but I ate the entire thing, it was so good!!!

They are so much better now and I'm definitely going back there often!! So glad!!!
