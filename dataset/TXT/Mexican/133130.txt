iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg While I enjoyed the tacos it was at as amazing as the reviews made them out to be. One was too salty (blackened something something) but the shrimp one was on point. They were large and very filling. Downside is it's a small joint, and when it gets crowded there is no where to stand, never mind to eat. That could be a bit frustrating. Luckily, my experience was we found ourself a little corner by the trash to eat.

Cash only. And no atms near by so be ready.
