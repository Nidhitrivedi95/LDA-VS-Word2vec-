Knowing how crazy Brunch can be (DW does not accept reservations on Sunday Brunch) we went around 11am to eat. This turned out to be a perfect time because all the 10am "Brunchers" were on their way out, so we did not have to wait for a table. 

Shout out to our waiter Nick, who made our experience amazing. He was very attentive and gave great suggestions.  I will not comment on the food, because its pretty amazing! and you can read everyone else's reviews.

Nick explained all the sauces on the table, as well as sent us complimentry Carrot Cake for dessert. We were stuffed! but not complaining of course!  

Tip: If you're on a budget, ask how much the specials are before you order. My boyfriend ended up getting the special filet breakfast burrito but we did not realize how much it cost until we got the bill. Overall, the experience is great! Can't wait to try DW Bistro for dinner.
