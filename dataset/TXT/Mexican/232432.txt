Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg A mixed review here. The food was superb, but the service had problems.


 This is a large place and easy to spot from the road. On entering the Mexican cantina atmosphere is recreated well. Just by the entrance is a small open room where senoritas are hand rolling stacks of fresh tortillas to be sent into the kitchen,.


 We were seated immediately by the Maitre'D and our Margharita orders were taken and delivered very promptly.


 After a short while a young waiter came to our table. His english was really poor and he either didn't understand or didn't know the answer to any of our questions about the menu. He brought over another waiter with slightly better english who we asked the same questions of. The reason we had so many questions is that my wife cannot eat food with any hot chillies in. She comes with me to mexican and Indian restaurants because they are my 2 favorite foods, but usually she can find something on the menu that she will enjoy.


 Anyway the first course was a tortilla soup that was included with all meals. Delicious.


 Then I had a combination platter of Beef & Bean Burrito, Cheese Enchilada and 2 Tacos. Again Delicious.


 The dish that my wife had made sure had no chillies in came to the table coveres in a hot salsa! Obviously we sent it back with the waiter.


 When, 15 mins later, I was nearly finished and no replacement had arrived I called the waiter and it turned out he had just taken back the dish without ordering a replacement without Salsa.


 After this I insisted on speaking to the Manager, who was very apologetic and sorted my wife's meal out but it is hardly ideal to go out to dinner with someone and find yourselves eating 30 mins apart!


 Like I said at the top, great food but it needs to sort out the service side before I come back. Especially as there are hardly a shortage of great mexican restaurants in Vegas.
