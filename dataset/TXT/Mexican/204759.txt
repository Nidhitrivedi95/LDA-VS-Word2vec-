pugciBzSCFqa_vn-X5pcEQ I got the 5 street tacos, you can choose from many types of meat and toppings. My food was great and cheap too! There's many things to choose from on the menu, tacos, burritos, nachos, quesadillas, they even have a breakfast menu! It's a small family owned restaurant and they were super friendly. We will definitely be going back some time soon! 

The only thing I would say was not so great is that they close at 8, I wish they were open a little later.
