fVo4uithMrIbNYom48b_fg The food at El Paso is delicious. The carnitas dishes are fantastic. The staff is personable and always willing to help with recommendations. I'm a sensitive celiac and have not been "glutened", always alerting my server and asking for corn tortillas. It's great having a go to Mexican restaurant in the South Hills.
