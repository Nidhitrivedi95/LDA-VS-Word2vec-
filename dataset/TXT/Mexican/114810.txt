gGt00WW8sNY2Sop7jYa7Tw We saw the reviews and photos for this place so we decided to give it a try for dinner. There's valet parkig right next to it or you can try to find parking on the street. This place definitely gives off a hipster vibe. It was packed so be prepared to be on the wait list. Drinks aren't really on special and prices for dinner cost way more than the portion they give you. I'll come back to drink of out the boot glass but food wise I'm good, thanks.
