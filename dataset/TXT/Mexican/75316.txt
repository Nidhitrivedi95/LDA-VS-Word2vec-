cIRZU99i82ReJxCqhgXc5g There's not much to say other than this place has some decent hot dogs with a lot of different options.  The only negatives that I can say we're the tater tots and the speed of the meal.

The fries tasted like your frozen bag tots which are just bland and uninspiring.  In addition, I wish they had cooked the meal quicker.  I love things made to order, but it was a good 20 minutes to get the food, which is a bit too long especially as no one was inside and we're talking hot dogs, not something that would need extended cooking times.
