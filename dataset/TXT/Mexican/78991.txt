CrwL7Y-jdzno4mmV7CN67A This place is a small diner looking Mexican restaurant that's is secretly a wonderful sit down place.
I am not talking about suit and tie but it is mos def a classy joint.
The food is homemade by people you can see in the kitchen and the manager/ owner came to check on us after cooking.
The food is amazing and the staff is super friendly. 
They also gave us a 20% card.
I will be back here again soon
