plHKBwA18aWeP-TG8DC96Q Smoke is so so delicious! 

I love the Egg Taco and can't seem to order anything else. The Mac and cheese is to die for! 

TIPS: The smoked meats are great, but some of the tacos pack some heat!. Ask your server about this if you are at all sensitive to spice. Get there early to save a table on the NoWait app and stroll around Lawrenceville while you wait. It's not always busy, but we have waited 2 hours for a table on a busy night - well worth it!
