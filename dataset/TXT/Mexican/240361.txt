T4OvU9iSqGnZ1g69QUG7Gw Finally, something that's open 24x7 in the far SE part of Hendertucky! With a drive-thru! Having had a bad experience with Roberto's I avoided this place for months since it opened thinking it was just another Roberto's clone. But in the past 2 weeks we've picked up 5 different orders and while the menu may be similar to their competition, the food is much better. 

Carne Asada nachos. Fausto's up the street is better but not by much. And these nachos can be picked up without leaving your car which puts them ahead of Fausto's. Want carne asada quesadillas? No problem. Chicken tacos and chicken enchiladas? Yes, and unlike the competition they won't be swimming in grease. and actually taste good. 

They have an app / website that you can pull up to see the menu and get coupons. And the drive-thru is sure convenient. When you crave tacos at 3 am, it's nice to have this place close by.
