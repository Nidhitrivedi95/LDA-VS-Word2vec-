IghwtXL8ZgK2dEL62Pzhrw Whoo boy. I was on my way to another extremely popular taco joint in the neighborhood and saw a line out the door. Pulled over, checked Yelp, and saw this little place nearby. I'm so glad I did, I think something changed inside me. These could very well be the best tacos I have eaten north of the border. Nothing fancy; you wont find find hipsters behind the counter, no coffee-braised anything, just simple and straight-to-the-point amazing street tacos. And I'm a man who knows my tacos. Trust me, eat here.
