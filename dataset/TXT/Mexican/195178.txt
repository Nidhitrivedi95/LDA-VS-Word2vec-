I ordered via the drive thru and there was some drama going on with the customer in front of me, which may had had then distracted since they didn't put my order churros in my bag, however they charged me for it. Lesson learned to ALWAYS check my bag prior to driving off. I ordered a grande avocado chicken bowl and an order of churros. 

The bowl was good, my only complaint was the lack of avocado, the online pictures are deceiving.

Grande avocado chicken bowl - 3 1/2 stars

This time I ordered from the one on East Thomas. Thank goodness my food was free thanks to the $10 comp that the company gave me for the mistake on my last order. This time the food was lacking in flavor, I didn't even finish it. Needless to say I will NOT be back.
