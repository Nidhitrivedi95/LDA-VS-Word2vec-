_H4GXECi4nHfJTz4dsQV_w Other than being muy disappointed that they were out of Carne Asada, we were pleasantly surprised and pleased with our choices of brisket wrap and barbacoa burrito.  Two previous food tenants in the space failed, so we hope people will patronize Rita's enough for them to succeed.  The food is very good and the prices are very reasonable for such high quality.
