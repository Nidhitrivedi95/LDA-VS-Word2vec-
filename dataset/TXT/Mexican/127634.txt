HWl2EbZhkhAkFgqt44yUkA This place is way overrated. Prices are way too high and the quality of service is awful. Understaffed, limited menu, and even though there were plenty of seats outside where we asked to sit, the hostess told us that we would have to wait to sit outside but the inside was readily available, which was funny because when we came inside it was WAY more packed.  I had to freeze my whole dinner.  The margaritas SUCK!  We ordered 2 yards of Mother Froggers which should have had Patron in them, but they tasted like watered down bottom grade margaritas.  The $9 tortillas soup was basically tomato soup with a few ingredients you can add in.  Im sorry but if I wanted to be robbed I would've just went to Mexico.  I highly encourage you to think twice before coming here.
