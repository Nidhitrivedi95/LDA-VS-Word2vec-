dCPyV8XCEyE7pyUgzOCDKA I am a huge fan of Chipolte and it is one of the only fast food places that I will frequent because they are committed to using all natural, non-GMO ingredients.  The food is high quality and a great option when you need to grab something delicious and nutritious on the go.  This location is always really busy so I've only gotten take out from here.  The store is generally clean even during busier times and my only complaint is the customer service which is typically close to non-existent even during their slower times, which is why I don't give this location 4 or 5 stars from me.  The employees just aren't very friendly here, and I realize that they get slammed during lunch time but it still doesn't make for a pleasant experience to feel as though my business isn't appreciated.
