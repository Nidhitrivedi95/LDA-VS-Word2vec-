S3qs5ZAZgqDvM88jj17hbQ First of let me say that this is better then the other restaurant in Laval centropolis. I took the enchilada, weren't to bad but not that inspiring also. I felt I could have made something better at home.My gf took the fajitas plate, the chicken was moist and well seasoned, but they barely give cheese which I don't really understand. The chips and salsa are good here though, the chips taste home made, not oily and well salted.

The drinks here are the real star, take the 4 oz margarita, hey if it's your birthday you get a somprero I think! Sorry I forgot to take photo, will do next time.
