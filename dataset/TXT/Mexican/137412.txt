itnExCtgV-49SKgMs3M7kg Something is changing at Chipotle...and it ain't good! The last three times I've been there the portions were smaller in the bowl meals and there was much less meat in there. The guacamole was not super fresh, and had a little browning to it. The burritos don't seem to be rolled very well. I haven't been back. Me thinks the fast food genes are starting to reveal themselves. So disappointed, because I used to love my burrito bowl.
