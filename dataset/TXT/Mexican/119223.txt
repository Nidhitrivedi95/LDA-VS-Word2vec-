GrwvBAEALujIOPQeOfN1vA We had a good time here.  The waitresses and manager were friendly with us and the food was tasty.  I wish it was actually a little spicier though.  For a place called Jalapeno Inferno Bistro they should have some KILLER hot sauce but they didn't.  I really like the look of this place on the inside.  High ceilings and cool southwestern style paintings are on the walls.  I did like the Kick Ass Tex Ass margarita.  Yummy.
