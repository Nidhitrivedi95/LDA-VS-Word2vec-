tXZxc-3HcXvj1Z-Tzs4Mkw This place sucks. I ate lunch here a few days ago. I know this area isn't exactly a mecca of fine cuisine, but this restaurant was just all kinds of wrong. One of the worst places I have eaten in a long time. The waitress was high on something or half asleep, not sure which. The chips and salsa were the token Mexican restaurant staple, to be expected. The food was slop. Camarones del diablo (spicy shrimp dish), tasted like camarones de la basura (shrimp from the trash can). Tasted like canned food. It was supposed to come with guacamole, and did not. It wasn't very spicy, as described. I'd take a hot-pocket over this food any day of the week. My stomach ached for the rest of the day after this meal. Honestly, if I lived in Robinson, I'd probably return here just to give it a second chance, due to a lack of Mexican options. Hopefully this was an uncommon experience, but I'm not going to find out. Maybe the margaritas are good? Maybe dinner service is better than the lunch service?
