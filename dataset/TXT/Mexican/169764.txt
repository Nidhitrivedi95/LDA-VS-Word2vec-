lXYTzkRVMHPYGcDRc_8JvQ Good food (sometimes). Other times I notice the steak isn't always cooked and has a kind of chewy texture to it (really chewy). Staff is always nice. Not sure who the manager is now, but in the past I had always had pleasant experiences with them. I do wish that they allowed for more meat in their bowls/burritos (without the extra $2-3 charge they rack on for asking). Chips are great (as long as they have sat for a while.) I will return.. not as often as I used to....but I can overlook the smaller things, shut up, and enjoy their food. I also need to check out other make it burritos places and compare how they do against chipotle.
