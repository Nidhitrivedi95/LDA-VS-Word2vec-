PkL9tPTvvEtmBJvckrD_vg Want MICROWAVED fish for your fish taco?? GO HERE!!!

This place had a dealfind coupon for $12 which gave us 2 burritos, 2 chips and salsa/cheese and 2 drinks. 

I ordered the fish while the wife ordered the carne asada. I was shocked that they dont cook their fish to order like burrito boyz / fat bastard do .. but they microwave fish fingers that look like your grocery store variety. 

Taste was so-so. Something I can make at home. 

NEVER COMING BACK .. coupon or no coupon.
