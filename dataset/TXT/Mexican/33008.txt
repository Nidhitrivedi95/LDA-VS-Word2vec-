We arrived a mid day to an almost empty house.  After getting seated it took about 10 minutes to get drinks orders and menus.  

My party of 4 decided to split the Nachos Grande, as they advertise it feeding "3-4 Amigos".  They were pretty spot on, as the nachos tower nearly a foot from the base of the plate.  Sadly, nearly 2/3's of it are just nacho chips.  The outside of the chip tower is drizzled in pic de gallo, cheese, sour cream, salsa, and guacamole, with a heavy black bean base.  After a few initial scoops, the tower becomes very heavy on plain chips.

Wanting to fill up a little more, I ordered 2 tacos from their happy hour menu ($2 carnitas and chicken tacos).  My companions also ordered some other items.  Handling the orders for a table of four seemed to be an issue with wrong orders coming out and some not being delivered all together.  As for the tacos themselves, the chicken taco was garbage, but the carnitas was delicious.  Do the pork tacos.  My friend raved about the Mexican street corn - worth a shot if that's your thing.

Overall, I've experienced better.
