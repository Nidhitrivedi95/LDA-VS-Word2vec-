MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA So I loved it obviously! I really liked the taco with crispy cauliflower because there is just not enough cauliflower play in the world! Honestly, loved it!! Also the fish, but I am sure everyone recommends that. They play grimey rap and hip hop and we somehow only waited 20 minutes on a sunday afternoon... but put in your order and stroll around the plethora of shops in the neighborhood. Yumsies!
