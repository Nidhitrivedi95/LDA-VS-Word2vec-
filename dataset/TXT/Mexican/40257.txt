6qKjl6xJQzLb9ka-QbTudA Customer Service: Great! Very welcoming, great at suggesting menu items & attentive overall. 

Food: Delicia! Very yummy Mexican food + They have the perfect serving sizes to satisfy your hunger. 

Hygiene: What I really loved is the restaurant is very clean & well-maintained. From the entrance , seating to the restrooms. 


Overall, The restaurant is small imagine going in to a Subway type setting. Its not for large parties as theres not enough room. If you are not familiar with Mexican food, they have a menu on the wall with pictures of the dishes. Also, the food is made fresh, you can tell once you take the first bite. If you're looking to explore, id deff recommend this restaurant :-)
