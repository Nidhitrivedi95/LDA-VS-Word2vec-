vqEtZ7CtNB9G8WMzjwJA2g Always amazing tacos and food, especially love the taco of the day. But I regretfully can't rate it any better, the old fashion was sickenly sweet and the sangria were very watery. For a bar that's just not okay. If your only having beer and food, this place is awesome, but if you want a cocktail or a Margarita go elsewhere. They do have an extensive tequila offering, so if you drink your tequila straight, there is that.
