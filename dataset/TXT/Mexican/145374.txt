Having lived in BC for a few years, I was really impressed with the Taco Time locations out there. Enough so that when I learned there was one in Ajax, I decided to mission up there anytime I could. 

Well, after four tries, and long drives to get there - I'm done. 

This location is absolutely nothing like their BC counterparts. The portions are smaller, the ingredients far less fresh, and there's just something seriously missing in the flavour. Each time I've gone, there has been some kind of error or problem with my order. 

The final straw was taking a detour up there while heading home on the 401 west. I ordered a large Super Beef with a large Mexi-Fries Deluxe. My receipt reflected this. 

I get home and open the bag to find a tiny, barely-filled burrito that was literally 1/3rd the size and deliciousness of what I'd had in Vancouver, and a regular sized, regular Mexi-Fries. I was the only customer in there, so this wasn't some mix-up.

I hope that this place goes out of business. I'd rather fly back to Vancouver for quality Taco Time than ever go back to this place.
