UGiMMw54qYxac0eE_cBbaA I wish I could give less than one star. We were here on a layover and experienced nothing but irritation from our server, Jeffrey. He not only talked crap about his tables at the server station (1 step from our table) but was also extremely unfriendly and unknowledgeable about the menu. As an airport restaurant I doubt they will look at this, but they certainly should. I hate traveling through Vegas solely because the restaurants are less than mediocre.
