WrlJ7HR3WrpjkSCh8-O4kg First off let me say I go to this place a lot. Me and my son go tonight to eat. I order 2 bean and cheese burritos, and carne asada fries with half the sour cream on the fries and half of the sour cream on the side. She makes a big deal about the sour cream thing. I said whatever ur normal portion is just cut it in half. Half here and half there. So I get my food she doesn't listen there's no sour cream on the fries. So I talk to the cook he's like ok give it to me and I'll put some on the fries. She makes a face and rolls her eyes. Whatever I'm thinking it's the way I want it. So me and my son start to eat, and my bran and cheese burrito is freezing cold not even the tortilla is hot. So I take it back and say my burrito is ice cold please make another one. I even told her feel the other side of u don't believe me. She doesn't of course just rolls the eyes again, and throws it away. So now I'm getting irritated, and I call the number they have posted on the counter. He calls me back, and ask to speak to the lady. She rejects to speak to her own boss.  So he's like I'll call the store. He calls the store I sit down, and eat with my son. He calls me back and says that she says I'm problematic everyone I go there. REALLY??? 
Why because she can't follow instructions on the sour cream ??? I'm like ok when I get home before I write this review I'm gonna call or text him to see if there is someone higher that I can talk 2. He says no, and that I'm the only customer who called today, and that I'm lying about my burrito being cold. <U+200D> Really I'm gonna lie about my burrito being cold, and if I was lying why would I tell her to feel it??? I wish I can post the pic. Of the text he sent me. Don't give robertos ur money! Please save ur self the headache and give ur money to a better Mexican restaurant or at least one who will not call u a liar, and take care of the issues.
