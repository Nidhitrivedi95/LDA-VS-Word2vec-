JsCKeWHA8n_5mFQ3F6t4UA "MEH" is right!

Living in California makes it really hard to give high ratings to mexican
restaurants around the world.. ours are so much better! We had an awkward
table that felt like was in the way of everyone and everything. The place was
expectedly noisy (inside NYNY, next to the casinos and the rollercoaster)
and also rather dirty. Taquerias aren't always spotless, but hey.. it just FELT
like we were in a dirty place. The food was below average, I don't think I even
got halfway through before throwing in the towel.. and the service was
pretty non-existent. With all the places around, I really doubt I'll ever be back here..
felt too much like a crowded Taco Bell full of drunk teenagers.
