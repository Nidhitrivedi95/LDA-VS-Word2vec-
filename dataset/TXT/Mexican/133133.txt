iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg After being informed that a long line up can form before this place opens for their business, the little budget foodie group that I often hang out with got the best spots in the line by arriving about an hour early before seemingly obscured eatery opened its doors.
I decided to take a few pictures in the area before getting my spot. This place needs to put up a really noticeable sign for their store because I walked right past it up kensignton avenue to baldwin street and when I decided to head back here I still couldn't spot it until after I looked at my map app a few times and saw one of my foodie buddies standing infront of the store. It was a Saturday and people did not start lining up until about 20 minutes before 12pm, proving the rumors about the line up. Being some of the few at the front of the line was beneficial because our orders were taken swiftly and the food was served promptly.
When I looked at a pic of their menu on Yelp, I already had my mind made up to try out the Baja Fish (Mahi Mahi) taco. The taco served in a red basket with a checkered lining was light and the fried fish was not at all greasy and the vegetable garnishes also countered the grease from the fish. However, I do wish that I could have gotten a distinct taste of the fish and the cream sauce on it. I think the real stars that day were the three different hot sauces, each heat level made with a different type of pepper. It added a bit of zing to the fish especially the medium.
I will probably go back at some point if I want to brave the line up as I'm curious to try the "Gobernador". And my fellow foodies also raved about the Agua Frescas.
This place seems to be the spot where if you really need to satisfy your cravings for some "local food hub/street-food style" type tacos that are of the comfort-food variety then go check out Seven Lives
