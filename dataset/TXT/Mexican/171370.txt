manv27dcWwK7reqL-PLDKA Car broke down in their parking lot. Employees were super impatient about it and interrupted me while I was on the phone with the tow company. Went in to explain the situation to them and they insisted I had to move my broken car NOW and not wait 15 minutes to get it towed. Accused me of being rude for not answering them while on the phone with the tow company.
