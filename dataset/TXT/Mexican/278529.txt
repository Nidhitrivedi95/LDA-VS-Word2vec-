XNWXyFgCGaAwvg9QML2Ypw We really like Mad Mex for what it is. Sure, it's fast casual--not upscale--but tasty. 

We especially like:
+ Turkey and chickpea chili
+ Potato taquitos
+ Los Wingos, buffalo, medium
+ Spicy Mad Mex burrito (I get a "bare-ito", no tortilla, shrimp, tofu sour cream, and fake cheese)
+ Nacho Mama's Taco platter (half crunchy; half soft is how the husband likes it)
+ Enchiladas (really like their Coronado sauce)
+ Super long beer menu with lots of choices on tap
+ Margaritas
+ Red sangria (never tried the white)

Great deals:
+Student specials M-Th 2-4pm (half off many food items)
+Happy Hour weekdays 4:30-6:30 (1/2 price drafts and wings and margarita specials--get a "little butt" for only $3!)

P.S. Brunch is served on Sundays. The huevos rancharos are great!
