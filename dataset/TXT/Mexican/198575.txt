P8IsTiHq5Hesa6UPL604ww Yum & I want more!! Didn't know that Guy Ferrari had did a piece on them. Glad that I didn't see the episode. Lunch time crowd-get there early. Ordered the Sopes w/carne asada served w/rice & beans. Very tasty. The sopes were yummy & carne asada flavorful. Chips & guacamole was ok-chips could have used a bit of salt.
