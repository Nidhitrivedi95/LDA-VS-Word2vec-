wDfz8ap9xWzj46mtNDcT9A If you can find this place, and you want some great mexican food, please stop by this little hole-in-the-wall joint, you won't regret it.  After a friend recommended Miguels, I went to check it out and almost wound up walking into the Mexican general store down the street before realizing this little trailer in front of a motel was the actual restaurant.  

but looks can be deceiving.  there is an outdoor seating area, which would be nice in the warmer months.  inside, the decor is, what i would call, Mexico's version of a diner.  with the prices to match.  I ordered the Fajitas, which were on special for $8, but these were not like any i've had before.  in addition to the standard peppers and onions, they also put in zuchinni, squash, mushrooms, and other veggies that really set the dish off, making them the best fajitas i have eaten.

They also had drink specials, which I do not recall at this moment.  All in all, I had a beer and a great dinner, with leftovers to take home, for less than $12.
