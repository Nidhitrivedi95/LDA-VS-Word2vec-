iIjVO7cLD1UEmIO7G05Ujw Worst service ever first time we went there was overcharged and bad service...thought we try it again had bad service...call speak with manager about being overcharged explained the situation...returns my call explains that I undercharged the second time I was there don't even talk about the first charges or the bad service....  What a great manager mother and daughter....don't fix the situation if there an owner like to speak with him ..the foods not all  that service sucks....don't mind paying for food and great service....long story short watch your tab ...then to end conversation I tell her that we just don't need to eat their if they can't explain my first charges. Her remark ok....I'll give your 15 cent
