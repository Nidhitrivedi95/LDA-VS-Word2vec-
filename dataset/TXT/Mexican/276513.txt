XH4jDFKyeCI7qkKq6PB9Nw I don't really like their food, but I was next door and was starving. The place was disgusting with flies flying around, especially by the salsa bar and when i was up at the register. This should be in violation of health code.The trash container that customers use looked filthy and needed to be wiped down. The place looked old and i know they took over another restaurant that used to be there. I forgot the name. I got their carnitas taco and as usual, the meat was dry. No matter how hungry I am, I'll never go back again! Get rid of the damn flies!!!
