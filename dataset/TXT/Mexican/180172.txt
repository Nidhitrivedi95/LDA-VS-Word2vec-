N5CL5HLS6lyltw-OjjBrOw Absolutely disgusting food last night! Service was awful. Will never come back here. We had to serve ourselves our own chips and salsa and they still billed us full charge. They got my order wrong and the food server had the audacity to tell me it was my chimichanga when it clearly was a burrito. Food was gross. The bartender apologized that they were short staffed.
