n_4PTgvjsKc74u8AwXOfAQ I just went here today, again.  I first went because I bought a deal site voucher and so I tried many things.  The tacos, burritos, soup, and something else, can't remember at this time.  But what I do remember is that it is all very good.  Today, I had a taco doble, which means a double taco.  It filled me right up, just one taco doble, and for less than $3 you can't go wrong.

The family who run the place are very friendly, smiling, polite and let you take your time deciding.  Which, I do a lot.  :)  They give off a good vibe.

The kitchen area is clean, but they really need to go out to the tables more and wipe them down.  Today, I even asked they guy to clean the table, he must have forgot so I held my plate under my chin and ate my taco.  I think the floor could be more spic and span too.  If it wasn't for this, I would give them a five star.

The prices are so cheap too.  Everything's a good deal.  For delicious, authentic Mexican food, it really is a good deal.
