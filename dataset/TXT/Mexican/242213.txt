TDFNuRJ_45hW18mu-V12JQ El Amigo is the one restaurant that my wife and I frequent that has consistently fast service in Kannapolis.  The food is good and fresh, the chips are handmade (unlike another poster accused them of using store bought), and they are super friendly!  I know that most of the employees speak Spanish as their first language and occasionally they speak to each other in Spanish near the tables, but it's never rude comments and doesn't that add to the atmosphere of a MEXICAN restaurant? 

All of our friends frequent this fun and family friendly restaurant.  They seat a huge group quickly and the liquid refreshment is always a welcome ending to a day!  

Go and enjoy El Amigo... they will treat you like a friend.
