In the evenings they have live music on the stage, and it is even more crowded. Chips and Salsa are good. The fish filet is lightly breaded and very good. They also have the kind that is the whole creature deep fried, but that's not for me! I highly recommend coming on Thursday because it is 50% off all dishes. My wife usually goes every Thursday! Sometimes the service is a little slow, especially when busy. Parking is usually a challenge, particularly in the evening and weekends. Bathrooms are a little scary. But the food is great and worth coming back.
