GzBIAjAMHD9iVZK8BT6XMw Visiting Las Vegas for the Run Rock N Roll races and couldn't shake the desire for breakfast tacos.  Husband and I literally eat tacos every week in San Francisco.  We've had them in Mexico on food tours, all over California and other parts of the US.  I wouldn't call myself a taco expert but feel like I have a good point of comparison.  

This place literally put the most love into my slow roasted pork tacos.  They scrambled eggs to add, grilled cheese on a plancha to add (OMG!) and had beautiful home made salsas.  The owner(?) took his time explaining and talking with us about them and they were a work of art.  I would venture to say that these were the best tacos I've ever had.  Maybe I had more authentic tacos in Mexico, but I'd have these over those any day.
