qWi9dNGo9D9I4F9RANc-6g So let me start by saying that the first time I ever came here I was not impressed. My boyfriend and I stopped in for happy hour, sat at the bar, and the place was beyond packed. I ordered a margarita ($5 during happy hour) and all I could taste was the mix. Because I was hangry and annoyed at my margarita, we left without eating and went elsewhere. However, we recently decided to give it another try and I am so glad we did!

We stopped by again for happy hour and sat at the bar, but it was MUCH less crowded this time. We both had a $2 modelo and $5 marg and split the pulled pork nachos ($5-all HH prices). The nachos were some of the best I've ever had. There was a cheese sauce on them that I would've drank straight if it had been socially acceptable. 

For our meals, I ordered the machaca tomales (coffee braised beef brisket) and my boyfriend got the al pastor taquitos. Both were very tasty but the tomales were to die for! The second I took my first bite I was so mad at myself for not coming back here sooner. It was enough for 3 meals worth and was just as good left over. 

The service was pretty standard- had probably 3 different people serving us (probably because we were at the bar) so it got a little confusing on who to ask for what, but everyone was friendly and I will definitely be back!
