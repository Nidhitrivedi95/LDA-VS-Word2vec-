ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA Came to Las Vegas for a trade show and met up with my cousin for lunch, downtown right across the street from El Cortez, this is a hidden gem, once you figure out that the entrance is down a little walkway at the end of the building you are in. 
The décor really interesting with Rosary's on part of one wall, and wrought iron in front of the kitchen it is a really artistic space. 

The staff is very attentive and makes sure you have plenty of chips and salsa, and that your drinks are refilled when needed.  The chips were fresh and warm, the salsa was spicy and flavorful. Our group had a nice selection from the menu and all of them were tasty and flavorful.
Chicken Tortilla soup, nice and creamy with large chunks of shredded chicken, good spice level with a very rich taste, good size bowl with more than enough for two to share. 
Carnitas Tacos, were small but filling, 3 per plate with nice little chunks of pork goodness.
Chicken Enchiladas, two large  enchiladas per plate, very large and filling, red sauce was a bit too sweet for my taste but adding some of the salsa made them very tasty.
Fajitas, enough for two to share, very tasty and filling.
Mexican corn, rice and beans are all served family style but there was more than enough to go around for our party of 7
Finished it off with tres-leeches cake which was very good.

Service was outstanding, food was very good, location was very convenient to where we were at the time and we would go back
