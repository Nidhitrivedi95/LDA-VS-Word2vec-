HRghNZCxQm0UGgvu4mk33w This chipotle just opened so I understand there being a small degree of confusion and disarray but my experience was definitely disappointing. We waited about 15 minutes in a small line mind you. Despite there being 6+ workers in the back, I guess it didn't dawn on any of them to step in and help. On top of that it was frustrating when they were out of certain items. I hope management will see this and make the right steps to improve this location considering it's my neighborhood chipotle and I was very excited to see it opening.
