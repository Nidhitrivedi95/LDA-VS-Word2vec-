hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg Awesome food and great atmosphere! My wife and Started with the casaritas which were perfect! We ordered the table side guacamole which was prepared by Edward who was very friendly and had great customer service skills. The food was great but be warned that the habanero salsa is very, very spicy...and delicious too! We had a great time and the price was very fair. We highly recommend this Resturant!
