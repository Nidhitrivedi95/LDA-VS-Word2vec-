They really seem to know how to mix their drinks. The Urban Mule is an elevated Moscow Mule with a hint of mint and lychee fruit. Their food is also tasty. Try their salad and order the vinaigrette. I added grilled salmon on top and it was cooked perfectly. Light, most, and delicate. On a previous visit I had the Caprese Sandwich and the crispy bread was so good, I couldn't stop eating it even though I was stuffed. The menu is small but there's so many delicious choices. The servers are cool and very knowledgeable. It's one of my favorite places in the South Side. I'd go back again and again just for the drinks. I particularly like the window seat.
