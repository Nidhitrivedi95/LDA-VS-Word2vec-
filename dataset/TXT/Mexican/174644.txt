MmU8ak-uG-s1RbqXu13m0Q i don't know what these other people are expecting but you definitely get what you pay for. It's a cheap Mexican place that caters to a younger crowd, not Chicanos straight out of Mexico. It's in DT Montreal and not a cantina in Cabo San Lucas. So loosen up a little.

I was recommended this place by a friend and I go here every time I'm in Montreal and always have a great time. The salsa is second to none (they give you a complimentary bowl of nachos and salsa while you're awaiting your meal) and I always end up buying a jar and bring it back to Ontario with me. I get the beef tacos and chicken burrito and it's pretty cheap. I will admit that the chicken can sometimes be a bit dry but other than that it is palatable. They're also famous for their daiquiris and margaritas which are giant, quite tasty and worth a slurp.

Although it's probably not the best Mexican restaurant in Montreal it's definitely a fun and cheap place to go. So if you're not anal about everything beyond your control, chances are you'll have a great time.
