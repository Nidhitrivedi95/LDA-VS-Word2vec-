Once we were seated, after waiting a very reasonable amount of time for 8 pm on a Saturday, we ordered chips/salsa and I got the carne tacos.  

The chips were hand-fried and perfect.  I love chips and salsa...simple, but delicous, and these did not dissapoint.

Despite my aversion to soft taco shells (I often forget soft is the norm, hard tacos on a menu are rare) and my initial disappointment seeing them come out soft...I was pleasantly surprised that they were VERY good.  I would not have thought simply steak, radishes and a avocado/cilantro based sauce/salsa would make a good taco, but it DID!  It was different, and it was great.  I think the radishes did wonders for the texture/crispness of the taco.  

I understand why everyone loves this place.  Add me to the list.
