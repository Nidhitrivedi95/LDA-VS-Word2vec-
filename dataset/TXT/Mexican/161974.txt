We tried a few different things, grilled shrimp salad, chicken tacos, chorizo tacos, and a carnitas burrito. Everything was top notch, including the complimentary homemade bean/chorizo dip and the salsas that were brought out with our meals. The food and the menu left absolutely nothing to be desired. 
The service also sets them apart. They were attentive and considerate and brought our salad out with both dressing options on the side, aware that we hadn't been there before. 
The topper was the excellent selection of Mexican beer, not just Corona. 
This is not only my new favorite Mexican restaurant, it's my new favorite restaurant in the Las Vegas valley.
