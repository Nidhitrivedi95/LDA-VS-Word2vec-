7F0ccIsqZSaqi1r7SB4nfQ I really wanted to like this restaurant but sadly it was disappointing.  The staff were very pleasant and attentive but the food was the worst Mexican I've ever had.  The nachos were greasy sitting all day, guacamole and salsa were very bland. What would it take to quickly fry up chips to order. The elote was good.  The octopus taco were like eating rubber bands.  No flavour and tough.  It was deep fried, not slowly boiled and finished off on the grill.  On the plus side, portion was generous.  The pork belly taco was way too sweet.  It needed more acid and heat.  Perhaps I've been spoiled by the many great Mexican restaurants in the city (Playa Cabana, Grand Electric, Carbon....  I had hoped I found a good Mexican in mid-town.  So sad.
