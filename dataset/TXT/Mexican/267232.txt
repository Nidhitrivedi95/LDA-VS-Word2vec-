wJ84TZZTuT0EdLzPHt8RDw White ass Mexican restaurant. Don't go here if you want anything authentic. Nothing on the menu sounded appetizing (no pics of food on the menu either) so I just got a salmon with mango salsa which was good. Salsa was pretty pathetic, I would say it's tasteless but I actually had to stop eating it cuz it just left a bad after taste. 

If you like mediocre food, this place is for you.
