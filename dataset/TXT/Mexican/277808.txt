xlXwxfiUD4bgJFKUYwkzOg Stopped in here while watching the bowl games in the casino. My friends were looking for a good place to drink so we chose Borracha. 

I'm happy we did!

Jesus really knew about his tequilas!  I never imagined a more fresh tasting margarita.   No pre-mix sour stuff like other places I've tried.   

We only ate a few quick appetizers and the taquitos were fantastic!  Gotta order those if you go.
