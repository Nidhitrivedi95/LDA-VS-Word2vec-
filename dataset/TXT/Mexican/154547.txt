K-uQkfSUTwu5LIwPB4b_vg Yes, tourist-like BUT they've got the goods big time and in every way.  Drinks, appetizers, soups, salads and desserts are executed with chef quality skill.  Atmosphere is sexy and romantic with a hip vibe mixed with elderly tourist so it pulls in diversity of customers and pleases most.  I especially like the patio dining options.
