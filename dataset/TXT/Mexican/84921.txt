D8qUkxB9IpT8IhnZV23auQ This place is awesome. It's a hidden gem that I really don't want to tell y'all about. But we're talking about great food at great prices. Not Tex mex. El Nevado is more authentic Mexican. Tacos, tortas, and other stuff that I don't know. I had two carnitas tacos and two carne asada gorditas. Tacos were really good. Gorditas were killer (really, get the gorditas!!!). The green sauce has a little kick, the red sauce has a lot of heat, and the onion slaw is good and cool. It's a small place, so even if the parking lot isn't packed the inside will be pretty full. A lot of people were ordering the horchata, so it must be good, but I opted for a Modelo.
