mB_cI1tCrNxxvr2e2myNrQ The Taco Bell of my dreams! It's such a great atmosphere and hella fun. Valet is free in the shopping center directly behind the cantina which is nice too. Definitely a must stop place when in Vegas. The nightclub atmosphere and cheap food makes it a great late night spot. Definitely will be going back when I go see Britney in September.
