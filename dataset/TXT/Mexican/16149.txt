1CSMpBHr3mYd9XEOldM2yw I always expected this place to be like Sprouts. It is more or less a Frys with much higher prices on a lot of items. For example, Lean Cuisine frozen meals were $3.98 here, the same Lean Cuisine at Frys was $2.50 and $1.98 at Walmart. I understand buying power of larger companies, and I am happy to do business with these smaller companies, but I will likely not be back. Stick with Sprouts, they have a lot more fresh produce, better meats, and better prices.
