nnQDIQ2FM4EfJW76IbmjfQ On a one hour layover to Fort Lauderdale My friends and I ordered 3 steak burritos and 3 small Redbulls. The total came to be around $45! For fast food airport food, I thought that was a bit over priced. 

The food was prepared fast. 

The burritos were kinda small, and the so called steak, should have been called shredded beef.

The taste of the burritos were good, and if I were in a rush to catch a plane, I would come back again.
