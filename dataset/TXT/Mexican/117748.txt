gOpOoZgrF2shRLCBBzO3Mw I have been talking this place up to my wife for months! Finally had a chance on my day off to get some lunch for us there today..... and it was damn good! Best burritos in town. My wife loved her California Burrito and my green chili pork was awesome! Those things are monsters and the price is so incredibly good! I will be returning often, with my family and friends!
