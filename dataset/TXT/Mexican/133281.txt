iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg When I first discovered this place it was nothing more then a small section in a store. I remember giving these tacos a try and becoming lost for words. I had ordered the carnita and the baja fish taco and had added the spicy sauce to them both. They were absolutely delicious. 

When I had returned to Kensington a few months later I realized the location had moved into a bigger spot (definitely a win) because the tacos were getting popular. The only thing that I would recommend is for there to be more seating area although I know the space is small many people do not want their tacos to go!

This is a hidden gem in the heart of Kensington market and anyone who thinks they know what good tacos are have no idea until they've been to Seven Lives.
