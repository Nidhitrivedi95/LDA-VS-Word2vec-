0ydy2fdDg6kpGy1dbnHYsQ Food was okay but it was just tacos.  You can't mess that up too bad. But, service was not good at all.  I ordered from the combo platos. Not plate mind you. You had your choice of two or three items. I said two tacos and held up the obligatory two fingers. She questioned my order. I again said two.  Then she then says "dos tacos?". Baffled I agreed, I wanted "dos" tacos. My husband ordered three tacos.  She didn't understand him at first because he said "three" and not "tres". Keep in mind, this entire conversation is in English by a very American bred waitress. And the sign outside says "American-Mexican cuisine".  Then I ordered a water that was filled zero times after I drank down the initial offering. Once we were done with our food we sat about 10 minutes before she came to ask if she could get us anything. The wait wasn't because she was busy, we were one of three customers in the dining area with three (tres) other wait staff working. So all we wanted was the check at that point.  As we walked out to leave we did see all the wait staff sitting on the patio chatting.
