MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA My wife and I are in agreement -- this place is OK, but we're not going back.    

The food was just OK, the atmosphere was damaged by music that was painfully loud,  the service was not very warm and welcoming, and on top of that, the price was high.  

Lunch for my wife and I was $80, this included a number of taco's that still left us a bit hungry at the end, my wife had 3 glasses of wine, I had some Lemonaide.  I think $80 can buy better food and a better experience elsewhere.
