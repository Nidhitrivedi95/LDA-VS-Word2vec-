frwKRRIIR0QMv25IKVDIMA Just so disappointing. Came in under the power of a Groupon for take out.  

Ordered mini chimis. Soggy. Sitting on a bed of slimy old iceberg lettuce. 

Ordered macho nachos, guacamole was brown.  Literally just scraped it out and threw it away.  

Ordered dulce chimi, soggy relatively unimaginative and tasteless with caramel sauce one one side of chimis with cream cheese on the other. 

The other reviews are really positive here,  but trying to reuse old guacamole and old lettuce along with the presence of a Groupon indicate doom maybe eminent.  

Today's performance only helps.  I won't be back soon.
