SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA Finally found our Mexican restaurant! This place was amazing. The fajitas, queso fundido, rice and beans, and homemade tortillas were so good. The service was excellent too. Cesar did an exceptional job, especially considering he had a large party he was taking care of too. Even the busser was right on it. Highly recommend!
