WvunDFSs2hJrPHVFqB6Y1w Brothers Pizza can be really upsetting. It's the kind of place that can make AMAZING DELICIOUS PIZZA straight from a "mom and pops" looking kitchen. Yet on the other hand, it takes forever, and I mean...FOREVER to get it. I usually stop by in from my night job sometimes if I don't want to cook at home, and if I'm lucky I hope I'd have a 40 minute wait. It takes a long time, and sometimes its just one person working on all the orders. That place really needs a second hand in there. I'll keep this one updated if anything changes in the future.

Edit: revised, the Cleveland location moved down a bit towards Kamm's Corner. It took 20 minutes, it was far better experience than previous. Upped to 4/5 stars.
