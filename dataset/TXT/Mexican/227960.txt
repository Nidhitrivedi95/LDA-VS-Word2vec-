S599hCA4kJJO3_b6SRFKoA Gotta knock it down 2 stars, unfortunately.  We went for brunch at 12:30 and they had already ran out of desserts. The food was cold and not much to chose from as there only a few chaffing dishes. Yesterday we went back and the chile colorado was bland. We haven't given up on it yet, but our last 2 visits have been lack luster.
