pzy9xWQqsDxVU6j9MktRJg I like the feel of this restaurant with nice lightings, buzzing with people and delicious food, though I must admit, the additional parking area shared with days inn looks kinda shady. Was here for dinner with my wife and was greeted with smiling staff, you do have options to sit out and have food but I preferred sitting indoors. The chips and salsa were good, but not anything extra ordinary. The dinner portions of fajitas and one more dish(forgot the name) were more than enough to make you full so be sure if you are bigger groups to not order too much. The taste was good, liked the freshness of the veggies and the chicken was well fried and all items were served hot. The tortillas were hot and were freshly made. This is a must go if you like Mexican food and with so much Mexican families coming to this restaurant, as I could see from the crowd, am pretty sure this is closest to the authentic taste they have in Charlotte. Please try it out.
