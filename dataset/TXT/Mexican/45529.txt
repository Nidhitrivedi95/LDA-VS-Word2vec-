7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA When I first started coming to Lady Marmalade I was in love. Everything I tried was delicious and perfectly put together. It has been a couple years since my first time...and I still can't stop getting in (whatever size) line there is to get any one of the many Benedict's on the menu! Often I try to convince lots of friends to come with me so I don't feel guilty ordering the French Toast of the day to split for dessert!

With that being said- I just want the staff/ manager/ owner to read that I have been a little disappointed my most recent 2 visits. I really hope it was just a bad coincidence but both time my poached eggs were way over cooked, my toast was so hard it might have chipped a tooth if I wasn't careful and I couldn't even tell my waitress because she was some sort of a customer avoider extraordinaire.  

Obviously I will still be back, in hopes that those were just a couple of 'one offs'.
