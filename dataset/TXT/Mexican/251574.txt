UODskmUq92u6d2SH5MaO6Q Went here for the first time on7/16/17. Place was bright and clean. Food was good but expensive for what you got. Ordered the shrimp cocktail but they were out of shrimp. Bill was $19.60 for a burrito and a steak quesadilla and 2 sodas. You place your order at the counter then help yourself with your beverage. Then you wait for your food to be prepared and have to go back to the counter to get your food.
