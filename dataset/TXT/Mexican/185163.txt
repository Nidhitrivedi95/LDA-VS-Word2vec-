nUfeYJ_YEaDzggPKnYry3g Ugh.  Stopped here on a Monday night at about 7:30.  1 hour later we were finally seated.  Then we were told it would be another 30 to 40 min before we would get our food.  Once the food came I received pork enchildas vs the chicken i ordered.  Other items that were ordered was very dry and all of our meals were cold.  The carne asada that was ordered came out looking and tasting like a dry pot roast.The waitress was very nonchalent about the entire experience.  I really thought for mexican food in Az it would be an excellent meal. Oh and dont ask them to turn down the air conditioning (as it was extremely cold)  because if they did tge lights would go off. Skip this place and save your money.
