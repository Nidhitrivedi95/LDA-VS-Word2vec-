MN2oRaV4bZEbBIy_w7fNEQ Yet again my first time visiting another lunchtime chain store; and I was not impressed really. The food was only "OK" and a bit bland. Plenty sauces to choose from if you know what you're doing; but it would need a lot to cover the tasteless food. I had the "'lil bowl" and a drink and with a side of guacamole it came to $9.68?! Wow...not good value for $$ in any language! The staff are very friendly and service is fast (it was empty for the most part at 11:45) Their credit card reader was also down so it was harder on them than usual They could give you a little more taco meat on the meal also. Don't think I'll be going back....
