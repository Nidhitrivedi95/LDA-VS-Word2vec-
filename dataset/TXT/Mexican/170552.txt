m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw I have gotten to love this place. When they first opened, the wait was too long and I didn't find the quality of food and drinks to be worth the prices that are considered by some on the high-end for Mexican. When you consider what you're getting, it's not really overpriced. It's authentic style Mexican. So if you're looking for Chiles style cheaper meals, you won't like it here. The atmosphere is great, the service is spectacular and the margaritas are divine. We get the "special" margaritas with the extra Grand Marnier on top. The guacamole is delicious. I usually get fajitas, but this last visit, I ordered the steak quesadilla and split it with my daughter. It was also delicious. My husband usually orders something the waiter recommends and is always pleased. To our surprise, our waiter remembered what my husband had ordered a month prior and asked if he'd like the same or to try something else. This is what sealed the deal for us. When the wait staff is this attentive, management is as well and the entire restaurant reflects these attitudes. Towards the end of the meal, the manager stopped by and was super friendly and just like our waiter, seemed to enjoy his job. He asked for some feedback, and I shared with him how the word around town (or at least amongst our friends) is that they are overpriced. He asked what I thought, and I explained how after this visit, I have come to realize you pay for what you get. I further explained about the atmosphere, food and drink quality and staff are what we are also paying for. He appreciated our comments and bought us a round of shots. Now that is how I like to be treated! And I do love their Margaritas.
