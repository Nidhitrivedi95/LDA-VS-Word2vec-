i2hPnUeiCzDyyyzLtIWqgw I bought a chipotle burrito, to my surprise it was huge but as I was eating it.I didn't get any chicken until I was almost done with my burrito,got a little chunk of chicken. That's so ridiculous... Should be called a bean,rice and avocado burrito with a hint of chipotle chicken!
