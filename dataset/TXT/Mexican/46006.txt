7Q2cYSl5NBYytJzgjX0oKw They are supposed to have happy hour Saturday from 11-7. We went at 3:00 and were told they were not having happy hour because of the fight. The fight didn't start until 6. Why would you cancel HH all day?  Even though college football was on, most of the TVs were showing the prior days NFL preseason games or infomercials. Not impressed.
