WGkqfp1-3130v8xhCb3APg This was by far the worst customer service I've had in a long time. The waitress dropped two waters in front of us and walked away without even saying hello. Five minutes later she comes back up and says "do you want something besides water" and leaves the table again. Then she comes back again after another five minutes and says "do you know what you want" and repeats this until we had finally decided without her ever asking if we had questions about the menu or needed suggestions. She brought out our food which was a poor excuse for Mexican food. It tasted more like an American traditional restaurant trying to have a themed Mexican night. It was mediocre and some things were just too gross to finish. The waitress then brings our check back to us and without even looking at us throws it on our table because she was too preoccupied with going to greet her friends who were at the door. Everyone who worked at the restaurant seemed too distracted with talking and hanging out with each other that they were barely paying attention to the customers at all.
