I had the crunchy taco which had beef, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and......mashed potatoes yes I said mashed potatoes!!! It was delish. There are so many different tacos to chose from ad well as amazing avocado dip and cheese dip. The ceviche was amazing. I think they also have the best chips. Stephanie makes the absolute best drinks. Its super cheap too which is awesome! Definitely recommend this place for great food and a fun time!!
