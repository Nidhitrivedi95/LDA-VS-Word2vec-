d_L-rfS1vT3JMzgCUGtiow Good place to eat at if you're at Mandalay Bay. Got a nice table overlooking the water for our group. Service was good and most of the food prices were in the $$ range except for a few items.

Drinks were pretty good, margaritas especially. Got the queso fundo and Baja ceviche for appetizers. The former was unremarkable although the ceviche was good and must try. Also got the free corn tamale with the check in which was actually on the sweeter side.

For main course, I got the chicken poblano enchiladas which i for some reason kept associating with mole poblano sauce, but there was no mole. Anyways it was quite delicious. I do not recommend getting the side of potatoes. It's smashed but also deep fried and too crispy.

Overall good experience. We also got a discount because we were attending a conference nearby. They didn't know about the discount but ended up getting it anyways.
