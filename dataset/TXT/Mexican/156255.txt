Kcg5iMwYq5ibBuEhDXKx3Q Loved it. Hip-Hop from the speakers, tacos galore and Mescal-Tequila-Beer to wash the delicious food down. Rather small place, best to visit with 2-4 people. Waiting times unavoidable (no reservations), but defo worth the wait. The refried beans with melted cheese, the guacamole, my duck tacos, everything was super tasty. Relaxed atmosphere on the hipster side of things. I really loved the playlist (all Hip-Hop), a great evening.
