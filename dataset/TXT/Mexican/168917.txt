lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw Got here for happy hour. Currently enjoying the shrimp chiveche and their house salsas. Both delicious. For the main courses we got street tacos and the vegan chile relleno. The tacos were reminded us of actual TJ street tacos (good thing). The chile relleno was different from what I've had in the past, but it was very delicious. One of the best I've ever had. A must get too are the corn fritters.
