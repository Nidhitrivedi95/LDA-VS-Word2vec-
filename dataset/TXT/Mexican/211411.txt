qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A We came here for the bottomless mimosas. We ordered them and hey sat in the window for 15 min as our server stood outside and chatted nonchalantly. He came back inside and stood at the pass where our mimosas sat, walked away, came back, and walked away again. We ordered scones as an appetizer and he brought them out AFTER our main course was delivered. Our mimosa glasses sat empty more often than they were filled. My eggs Benedict needed more seasoning. The chilequilas were ok, but needed salt. Our server, Louis, left A LOT to be desired. Won't be coming back. The bottomless mimosas weren't all they're cracked up to be. Disappointed.
