This place is worth a trip, for sure. Even though it's been a while since we made the trek across town.  The food is pretty authentic and some things I've loved are the veggie tacos. They Taco Bell style crispy fried things, but filled with lovely beans, napole (cactus), and a little sprinkle of that mexican cheese. Guacamole is an extra $6 for huge tub of it. Margaritas with massive salt rims to die for!
