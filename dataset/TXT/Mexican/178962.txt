mz1zD5_eqyCQNuzAqB_iKg This place opened near me not too long ago, and I couldn't be happier! The food is excellent and this place is great if you're eating with vegans or vegetarians. They have a normal menu and a dedicated vegan menu; I've had food from both and have been pleased every time. The ambiance is nice for a smaller restaurant, and the servers are very pleasant. I recommend the vegan burrito with beer-battered avocados. They have a decent beer selection with multiple beers on tap. They also have vegan horchata. All in all this is a place that can satisfy those who want to eat light and those who are looking for some good hangover food. Can't recommend this place enough!
