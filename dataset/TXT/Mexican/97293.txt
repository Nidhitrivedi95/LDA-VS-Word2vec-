eJPckkV1k7gn0V2awA1pzA Ok so this place is cute, hidden and the service is wonderful! 
Buuuuuuuuuuuut geezuz it was so hard for me to enjoy my meal because they had these crazy fast fans blowing all over the place and it was blowing my baby hairs into my eyes and tickling my nose! After every bite I was scratching and swiping my fave from the irritation. And I don't know if those fans were blowing around dust but my allergies were wild inside there! Stepping out into the heat was actually relieving! 
Would've gave this place 5 stars if I could enjoy my meal comfortably....possibly putting some tables outside???
Oh and I had the Waikiki burrito style and added seaweed salad (for an additional charge) and it was very tasty and yummy!
