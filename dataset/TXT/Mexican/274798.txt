XaVHqVByyKswE0wV-B0HRg The food is not good and they raised prices way too high because they think that they are the only Mexican food restaurant in stoughton and as soon as the other mexican restaurant closed in town they raised their prices, stopped delivery and give less food. The shrimp was so disgusting it was gritty tasting. On top of that I know a worker that has been in their kitchen to look at their equipment and he said the kitchen was absolutely disgusting. the atmosphere is so dusty and they have lamps and there without the glass on them the carpet is filthy and it is really looking like some place I would never eat again I don't trust the cleanliness either
