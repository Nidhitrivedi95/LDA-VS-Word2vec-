Z6t15TXGlVh3-2ClZunCgg I am very iffy when it comes to eating at food trucks and Mexican restaurants so today I thought I try this place as I seen alot of positive reviews so I thought I give it a chance and I wasn't disappointed the Carne asada burrito I got was really good it made my mouth melt it was that good. The fries were good not great they kind of remind me of those crinkled fries from the grocery store that you buy at smiths still good though the prices here are reasonable and they always have deals going on overall this place will probably end up being my go to place as the food here pretty much won me over.
