DaVTuhzi6EgWStb2eAjNjA Came with some friends looking for some good Mexican food. We sat down, took a look at the menu and choose the breakfast menu. 

We ordered chilaquiles and added the cochinita... it was spectacular. The chips were hot and crunchy, the eggs were cooked perfectly. The sauce was absolutely delicious and the cochinita was sooo flavorful. 

Highly recommend this place. Staff was friendly but the food estaba rico.
