KbhrsTQEea2RF_94YWnBdQ Average food for a budget price. Some folks love it, i think its very ordinary.

Also, they microwave food in styrofoam containers which we know releases cancer causing chemicals into the food. I pointed this out and their response was...tell "them" not to make it if that is the case. Very callous attitude to a serious health issue.

Not trying to hurt a small business, just trying to get them to be more sensitive to heath issues and customer sentiment.
