bMSiHjs2fbKbBNPyuTwhHA Tacos are okay. I had the trio: cod, chicken and a third fish one. The most memorable is the cod for some reason. The tacos are huge. They came with a chicken and rice soup which was bland with no chicken. 

The wait was around 25 mins for lunch take out, so they offered to deliver them which is nice but it took over an hour to get them. We didn't eat lunch until around 2. If you don't normally deliver, I would say, don't offer it just to be nice. I don't know if the wait was really 25 mins or if they were further behind and therefore offered delivery? Who knows.
