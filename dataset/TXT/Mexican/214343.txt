QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA Wildly mediocre. The Irish nachos has so much mustard they were inedible, the knife work is aweful. How are you supposed to eat chips with a giant chunk of meat that is 5 inches long? It's nachos for God sake. Either way, I wouldn't recommend you eat here at all. We ordered two Cadillac margaritas and barely had a buzz for $50. On top of that our waiter was MIA our whole meal.  Unless you want to spend $100 and walk away being disappointed.
