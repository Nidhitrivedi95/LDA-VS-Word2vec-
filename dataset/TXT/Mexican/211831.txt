qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A I've been coming here for years so I figured it's about time I give these guys a shout out. Ok so usually I'm here for business lunch meetings and business happy hour but I've also been here with friends and family for dinner and also their excellent brunch. Obviously my favorite is brunch with friends. Never ending mimosas fo sho! The staff is with it  at making sure your flute isn't empty for long! One of the best reasons why brunch here is tops. Please Lyft :)! I usually order their chilaquiles- the chicken is cooked to perfection- moist and oh so flavorful! If you've had chilaquiles- these are on point- but definitely a more modern look and texture. Soooo fancy. That lime-sour cream though! So good!!! Their lamb is the best I've had and they have a solid salad selection! I always order the Cobb but have tried the Ahi as well, both very good. If you're looking to indulge but want to seem like you're being healthy- go for the CousCous. Very rich and filling. As far as appetizers I never not order the shrimp chorizo appetizer. Generous amounts of fresh thick cut pieces of chorizo, rotated cherry tomatoes and shrimp. Not sure what the dressing they use is (I want to sip it straight out the bowl) but I've seriously thought about coming here solo so I wouldn't have to share. If available, I will always ask for fried plantains as a sub for dessert. Yes, fried platanos!
