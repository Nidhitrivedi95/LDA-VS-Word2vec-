vzQkHCSFtYs3R0qRei2rjQ On my quest to find good Mexican food in the area, I took my family here for a birthday dinner when they were in town visiting.  My family lives in an area with a 50% Mexican population, so they are pretty quick to say if they like it or not.  First, we were impressed by the servers and staff.  Menu was large, had mole and service was fast.  I ordered a mole dish and it was disgusting.  My family stated their meals were ok (not good).  

Fast forward to the next morning.  None of us slept because we all had belly aches all night.  Then we all had to fight for the bathroom.

No thanks.
