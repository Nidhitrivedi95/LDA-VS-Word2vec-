Gy_XiWqkJM8JMaKk_sgXOw My favorite chips in the valley when served warm. As many will note, the service is not great or even very good for that matter but I do really like their machaca and chips. With that said, during lunch today I had the machaca meal that comes with tortilla, beans, and rice. All were tasty and hit the spot. I also ordered my usual horchata that always tastes good but always have thought their size for price is off. Overall, a good lunch spot that will satisfy your cravings but will not blow your mind.
