IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA Guacamole fantastic, but if you order it to have something to munch on know they give you chips with three salsas anyway. I got three different tacos but wish I had just gotten the Ensenada Battered - they were outta sight! Hubby got a torta and we can't remember which one. Tacos are small, palm sized. Rice and beans were tasteless. It was good overall though.
