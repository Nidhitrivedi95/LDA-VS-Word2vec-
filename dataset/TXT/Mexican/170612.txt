I would have to say this is my first negative review and simply because I don't go out of my way to tell people how horrible they are. However this time I can't let this go without telling people. This is my second time coming to this restaurant. The first time I came here it was amazing. This time I can't say the same. One thing I will say is our server Carissa was amazing. She was so sweet and came to check on us several times. For the management I can't say the same. There was a older gentleman that would walk around and say hi to the tables and make sure everything is ok. The whole time we sat there he did not come up to us once. The tables around us, yes he did but seemed to just pass us by every time. I thought it was odd until I brought it up to the other two other people with me. They noticed the exact same thing. What did all these tables have in common? They were all white and so was the manager. There were two other  tables he did not go up to. Another table whom were Hispanic like us and a table with Asians. This manager will sit and chat with each table once or twice but yet never made it to our table or the other two tables. I'm sorry I hate to play the race card but I never experienced something like this in my whole life. A restaurant that serves Mexican food and they didn't even acknowledge not just us but two other tables. But the other 6 to 7 tables he could. Blows my mind.
