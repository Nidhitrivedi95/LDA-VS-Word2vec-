WpI5MZC3XzlTpcUOKXzCbA Great place!  Good food, excellent crowd and fast service.  While we were there the air conditioning failed.  The outside air temp was 113 degrees.  Management realized the inconvenience to their customers as it was a packed house and brought a free round of drinks to our table.  I asked if they did this for everyone and the manager said that they did - Good on them!  Stuff happens but they worked through it and got the A/C back up and running within the hour.  P.S. Their Ensalada Marinera made in an avocado shell with shrimp was to die for!!!
