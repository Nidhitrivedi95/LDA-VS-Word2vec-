MZ8KNacVO4HDUxVdFkfhpw Absolutely loved eating here for the first time! It was wonderful walking in and seeing them make fresh tortillas while you wait in line. We stopped in for dinner. They have different items and you just select the type of meat. They have tostadas, burritos, tacos and salads. We all got burritos, I went with salmon. They have a vegetarian option which is just rice and beans. They offer enchilada style burritos at no extra cost. The burrito comes with a side of lettuce and pico. I asked for a side of their cilantro dressing which was amazing on top of my burrito. They don't offer a spicy salsa but they have a selection of hot sauces to choose from. 

We loved this place. The layout was really fun and casual. I'll defiantly eat here again when I am back in town.
