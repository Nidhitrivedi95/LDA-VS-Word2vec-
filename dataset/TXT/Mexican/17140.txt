I will say that the Bison burger was great. Again, not the best I've ever had, but if you've never had one before I would definitely recommend it. It was juicy and I really liked the collection of toppings- I'm a more is more kind of girl when it comes to toppings! I ate the whole thing, against my better judgement. Oops... 

I would probably give Urban Tap a solid 3 stars for being a good spot with above average food and ok decor, but the service bumped it up another star. We came in on a Monday so it was pretty dead, but our server was fantastic. I forget her name, but tall and blonde. She let me sample a few wines to decide which one I wanted, was really personable, and recommended a green tea shot to us which sounded awful but in reality was totally delicious. She also gave us the low down on where to look for going out spots after dinner. Overall, I would definitely go back, and if you're staying around the Carson St area you should definitely stop by here!
