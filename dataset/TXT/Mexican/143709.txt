JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg By now, you've probably heard of El Dorado Cantina -- if not, allow me to get you acquainted....

IT'S GOOD.

How good? I don't know. I can't really say. I didn't grow up in the Bay Area or Southern California. I grew up in Northwest Indiana. We didn't have the best Mexican food -- although Chicago has some quality spots. 

All I know about El Dorado Cantina is they do Mexican food about as good as I've ever tasted. 

Every dish I've had (from the stuffed shrimp, Siegel plate, fajitas, table-side guac, and habanero salsa *ask for it*) is bursting with unique flavor. All of the food is organic and non-GMO. The farms from which they source are listed on the menu. 

In my opinion, EDC does everything right. They're the future of what a successful business should be: quality, honesty, good customer service, and fair (somewhat) pricing. 

EDIT: 4/29/17/  ***

Like many, my original experiences with EDC were wonderful. The last few, however, have been very hit or miss.

Still much of what made EDC special remains, yet, much is changing. Lately, dishes have been served lukewarm, often times cold all together. The sizing/portions are inconsistent  (especially with my go-to: the Siegel plate). The service is generally still pretty great.

I worry EDC might be relying on reputation a bit too much these days. But I'll continue my visits.
