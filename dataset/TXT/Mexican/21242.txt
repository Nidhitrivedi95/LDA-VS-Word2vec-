2g4ZTD3ePNSbDAvh6qAOKQ Well then,  time to update.    I've been back a couple times..   

One thing to make note of:  the dare sandwich sucks.    They raised the price of it (because they can, I guess... which is a lame reason)  and it's really not a good thing to eat.     It's the sort of thing that might sound good if you're stoned past reason but I haven't been in that frame of mind in a decade or more,   and today even if I was I'd have the good sense to avoid dare sandwiches in general. 

The rest of the tortas with balanced ingredient lists are still exceptional.      But the place really is a bit too busy,  so I'll probably not go back for a little while - it's not like Phoenix is short on great Mexican.
