mB_cI1tCrNxxvr2e2myNrQ I'm somewhat of a fan of Taco Bell and I'm glad this place wasn't that far from my hote on the strip. It changes what I knew of Taco places by almost looking like a dance club. The drinks are poured like they come from beer taps, there's a second floor and you can even order from up there while you casually sit on the comfortable couches.
