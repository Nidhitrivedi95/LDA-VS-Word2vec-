Someone in my party ordered chicken. Another person in my table ordered shrimp and had bits of chicken among their shrimp. 

I had an allergic reaction - I would guess they cooked my meal along the shrimp.

Our waiter was great, but the guy who brought out the food was rude. Slammed the hot plates carelessly on the table. The kitchen made two errors in our order, which the waiter corrected quickly.

Fast, cheap and tasty, but we were grossed-out by cross-contamination.
