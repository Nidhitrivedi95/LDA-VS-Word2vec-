fzQeUR_AvjpwIWjsMDAbGw It takes 2.5 hours for a delivery more often then not. I ordered two burritos at 7:15 last night and didn't get them until after 9:30. When I called on the status of my order, it was like pulling teeth. The girl on the phone was no help whatsoever and didn't seem to think that over two hours for two burritos was an issue. No apology or explanation was given. There are better burrito spots more deserving of your money. Don't waste it on this bastard!
