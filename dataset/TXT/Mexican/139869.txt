Great Arizona ambiance!  Enjoy the dining room, the "patio" area or sit at one of the many tables in the bar and let Miguel, Kenny, Thomas, Mike or Emily serve you a margarita.  And don't translate "margarita" into a standard Mexican food restaurant - that is NOT what you will find at Sierra Bonita.  They serve great and unique southwestern fare.
