Arrived early and were promptly seated.  I debated back and forth between the steak and the short rib as I wanted to get "my meat on".  I settled on the braised short rib with black eyed peas (two ways) and a side of Peruvian mac n cheese (which is actually corn).  Wow. Amazing, amazing, amazing!!  The short rib was moist and tender enough to peel away with a fork.  The caramelization of the sugars as it was braised was flavorful and sealed in the moisture. The pairing with the peas and corn was dead on the spot!  After finishing our meal, we complimented the waiter on the food who then brought out the chef to accept our compliments!  Great atmosphere, great staff and great food.  Can't wait to be back!  Give it a try, you will not be disappointed.

Tips:  -This place just opened, but probably will be booking fast-so make reservations.
          -Bar is very nice and inviting.
          -The kale salad is great and will feed four people!
          - Go for the short rib!
