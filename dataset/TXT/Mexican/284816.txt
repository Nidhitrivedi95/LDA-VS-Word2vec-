I realize that 99% of fast food never looks anything like the commercial portrays. This burger was a huge disappointment though. The flavor as constructed taste of only BBQ sauce. Even though that is the flavor the dryness amazed me having to wash down what I was eating with my drink so that I could actually swallow it. I was also expecting a small portion of the rib but again it was even smaller than I expected with barely enough to cover 1/4 of the patty. The flavor in the rib meat by itself was actually very good but was lost in the sandwich itself. I would definitely expect more for a $11.76 SMALL combo meal, and would have rather spent that at a sit down restaurant on a quality product.
