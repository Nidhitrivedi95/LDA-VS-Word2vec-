zjvnqTjBp56NhMp1GrlO5g I love this place from the decor to the specialty drinks to the food. The P&J with fruit is awesome, fruity pebble waffle the best around and the sungay brunch menu is hilarious. The only reason why it's not 5 stars for me and I've been here twice is the service. I know a lot if the other reviews on here talk if the same thing and it's true. Once your server finally comes I suggest ordering everything all at once. Take your time drinking those drinks because it will be a good 10-20 minutes for anyone to come back by. They need to be on top of their service! I'm local bad service = no tip well at least not what you should have been paid had you hustled your little tushy faster!
