ohqeJybL1FuFzN4P8pwxhg I ordered a bagel  based on what I saw in the case and paid... only to be told they were out of the bagels I ordered. Chose another bagel..... tasted like burnt toast with very little cream cheese. Pastry was not fresh (cherry danish was actually hard) and tasted stale. SLOW service. Took forever to even be acknowledged. I am literally shocked this location is still in business.
