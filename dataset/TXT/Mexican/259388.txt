Voeq7aGDmCGMjE_SQiHwRA Let's start with the positive: the atmosphere is pretty cool here with tons of people all seeming to enjoy themselves (Friday night). The servers, while nice, were busy (at the bar) and inattentive. We actually wanted a second drink but after waiting 15 minutes with empty glasses we decided to just close out. The plain margarita was made from fresh juices and was delish at first, but ended up tasting too heavy and sweet. 

The food: average at best. The queso, while nice and thick, tasted floury and was impossible to pick up using a chip. We got three different tacos and were equally unimpressed with them - while nothing tasted bad, I don't care if I ever have them again. Fish was missing something, the pork belly pastor was overcooked and tough and the short rib was unexpectedly spicy. Cilantro was a heavy addition. 

We're not dying to return.
