3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ Found this pretty cool lunch spot with some coworkers one day. Really digging the theme with the church stained glass still intact. The tacos were great especially the shrimp taco. The salsas were okay, good for Phoenix standards but I've had better in SD. I'll be coming back for more tacos and tortilla chips (which sprinkled with lemon and salt are heavenly).
