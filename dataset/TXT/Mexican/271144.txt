WpI5MZC3XzlTpcUOKXzCbA Don't you hate when people hype up a place so much that when you finally go it isn't what you expect.

The service was excellent and the salsa and bean dip was delicious but i expected better when it came to my enchiladas.

I normally get my enchiladas elsewhere and they are fantastic and the same price as here, the hype was built up so great so i wws expecting better i guess. 

i would recommend people to try this place to make their own decision. I'm not big on mexican food so it may be me but I'll be going back to my other place for my enchilada fix.
