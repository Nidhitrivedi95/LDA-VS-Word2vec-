mWEltFSw33nARGPLvZiAJw First time I've ever seen a restaurant actually ask you for tips had one girl tell me are you going to leave a tip which seems kind of rude or even unprofessional I mean you only see the waitress twice once when she takes the order and another one when  she brings you the food and I know what you're thinking this guy is cheap, I know they live off their tips. Imagine you're in line waiting to pay the the check and it doesn't matter if you dine  in or you ordered to go there make sure they put you on the spot by asking you in front of everybody are you gonna leave a tip.
