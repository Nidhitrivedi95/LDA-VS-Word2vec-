We went to Nacho Daddys to celebrate National Nachos Day....which the waiter had NO IDEA what we were talking about!
So we ordered a delicious pitcher of House Margaritas....very well made and just the right mix of everything! :)
Then we ordered the Supreme Tostada Nachos and they were DELICIOUS, Beautifully built where the entire top layer was covered with all the ingredients....it was the best plate of Nachos we've ever had!
