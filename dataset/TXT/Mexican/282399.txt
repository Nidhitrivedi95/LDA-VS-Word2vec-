XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Let me start out by apologizing to Bobby Flay...so sorry. When my wife and I watch him cook on TV I always make fun of him using the same ingredients, ie cilantro, corn, mango salsa, etc...but, man does it work in person. We went during restaurant week but I won't bore you with the same review that other people already wrote. All I will say is that I was very, very pleasantly surprised on how good the food was. If ever at Caesars, then I will stop in for a delicious meal. BTW, the hostess was a bit snooty and tried sticking us at a booty table at first...
