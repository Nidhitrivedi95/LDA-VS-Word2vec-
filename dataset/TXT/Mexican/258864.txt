vnKHXrw585IOH4F3m29yFQ This is a lovely Mexican restaurant. They decorate with Talavera pottery and old Loteria playing cards and it really sets the tone. Mostly, Loteria lets you step into an old part of Mejico which is long gone.

We only stopped for a very small meal. On a crisp Fall day, a bowl of spicy tortilla soup tastes so much like home. Even if home is definitely not Mejico! My friend had the tacos and he had never had authentic Mexican food before and loved it. We share the guacamole. Made with diced tomato and cilantro, this is very fresh guacamole. The lime adds to the freshness and juiciness. 

The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Sit at the bar for the best service!

I'd love to return for a meal. I've been to few Mexican sit down restaurants and this is one I'd love to return to to taste and compare.
