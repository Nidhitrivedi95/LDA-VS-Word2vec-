svdEhLmNmpVaIv1WLtoOvQ Fantastic. Best "guera" (American) taco ever. Among the best carne asada ever. First lengua I've ever had (delish, need more).

Granted, I grew up in Ohio. 

But I've had several thousand American tacos, and none better than this. Surprise twist: mashed potatoes. Verdict: Why didn't I think of that?

Carne asada was, no joke, top 3. Best ever was from a truck in Nogales Arizona. Second best was El Camino, Columbus Ohio (of all places). But now the two-spot is Tacos and Beer. 

I feel like you can tell a lot about somebody by how they introduce themselves. Tacos and Beer didn't reveal in name or locale, but my inquiry was well rewarded.
