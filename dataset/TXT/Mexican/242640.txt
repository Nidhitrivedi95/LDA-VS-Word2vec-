Ted-cvKJ7pojwy416PVRhw We came here to try out of curiosity. Happened to come during happy hour, which is Half off appetizers, and cheaper drinks. We were greeted by a friendly server and seated, and served a fresh house-made basket of tortilla chips with three different dips. A house made salsa, a tomatillo sauce, and a yummy bean dip.
We ordered a couple of margaritas and they were delicious. Only five bucks during happy hour.
We then ordered our mains, both hubby and I had the combo number two which is one taco and one burrito with your choice of meat, served with beans and rice. We both had the shredded beef taco, in which the taco shell is house-made and wonderful, and we both had the 'mixta' burrito which consists of a combination of pork and carne Asada meat.
Unlike most places, the burrito here was huge and filled mostly with meat, instead of being filled with more rice and beans than meat like other places. 
The taste and flavour of the pork was amazing, and our next visits here, I will be eating exclusively the pork.
The service was great, and we will be back for sure.
Not sure why this place only got a three star rating, because our experience here was much better. We will definitely be back as the flavours are much better than most Mexican restaurants.
