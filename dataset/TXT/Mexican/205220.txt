pUX9gzo1Tf4vRv7hX0eP1g I wasn't real thrilled with our order. We ordered through grub hub so it was delivered to our door. I ordered a chimichanga with rice and beans. The only thing good was the beans. The chimi was covered in a gross cheese sauce ( never seen chimichangas with sauce before?)  I tried to wipe it off and eat it but couldn't ignore the nasty sauce taste. The rice looked and tasted a couple days old. It wasn't soft, but a little crunchy. Like stale. 
I ordered 2 carne asada tacos for my fiance and i, they were disgusting. The tortillas were burnt & the meat was chewy and tough. 
I dont eat Roberto's, but I'd eat there before I'd ever eat here again.
