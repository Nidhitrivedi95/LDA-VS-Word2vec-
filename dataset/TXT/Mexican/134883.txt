IkMwuS3eViVHK09npuG1jQ How can EPL open a new location and not babysit it long enough to get it off and running?  I was impressed that the old KFC location on Sahara, which sat vacant forever, finally got an overhaul and a tenant.  EPL seemed like a good option for the property. It also seemed like a fine opportunity to grab some food.

Ordered via drive-thru on 3/17 at 1:01pm and was sorely disappointed. My ordering went like this: Hi, I would like an order of the shrimp baja avocado tacos, please.  She asks, "how many?"  One order, please.  She asks again, "how many?"  One order, which I tell her it shows on the board contains two tacos.  "Oh, okay."  Duh, now I'm confused.

Once I get my one order of two tacos, I pull over and park.  Good thing because one of the tacos is so filled with special sauce which is dripping out either side of the taco. There is  shrimp perched on one corner and avocado on the opposite corner, with small stingy strips of cabbage in between. That was a hot mess to eat gracefully.  The other taco had the avocado plunked in the middle and shrimp on both sides, same stingy cabbage. Took a bite out of one end and had a hot-sauce laced shrimp escape out the other, falling between the seat and console.  It's funny now, but it wasn't then.  And to add insult to injury, it wasn't even tasty!

I'm not trying to compare EPL with an upscale eatery, just one location vs another seems fair to me. Well, it doesn't come close to the one at Decatur/Sahara or the one on Craig Road. Come on EPL, do something and fix what's broken!
