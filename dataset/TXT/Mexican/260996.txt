VRwT0pscR5vESCrAnUpNwQ Came here at around 4PM on a weekday and it wasn't busy, but definitely expect a rush around noon or dinner time (I've passed this place many times and seen how busy it could get!) My boyfriend and I ordered the chips, guac, and queso, which were really good! And they give you a generous amount of chips too. The tacos are okay- I've tasted better, but definitely order their fish tacos if you do come here. They also have a bunch of hot sauces and different taco condiments which I love! Their pineapple salsa is soooo good! Their tacos weren't great as I hoped it would be, considering I've tried a lot of other taco places in Toronto, but nonetheless it was affordable and still satisfied the craving!
