BIbjBxoiJLS8CnNsSP64TQ Since you cannot bring your own water into the airport, I stopped at 360 Gourmet Burrito to buy a bottle of water and a bag of M & M's.  

I think it's a disgrace that because we are a captive audience, they can charge $3.29 for the water and $3.29 for the M & M's.  To add to the disgrace, the lack of a pleasant employee!
