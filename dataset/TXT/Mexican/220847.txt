rjlAUHT8B6KhKAmkZqS1xw I have given 4 stars as the food and setting is great . Had dinner here and the young man explained the menu and was very attentive, decided to try brunch today ... food was good service sucked ... no spoon for the coffee , waitress checked in once waited a long time to place order....impression I received was that serving was beneath her and she was doing us a favor ....she definitely does not belong in the service industry.
