ttUkBP8GIuzA_Y3tN3hhkg I had the Fish Taco Platos, it came with refried beans with red sauce and cheese, white rice topped with pico de gallo, and two fish tacos. The two pieces of fish were fried and topped with tomatoes, cabbage and lime, I ordered my fish tacos with a flour tortilla, but I'm pretty sure it actually comes on corn tortillas.  

The meal was tastier than the normal fast food fare, and the price was affordable. You can't go wrong if you're in the mood for fish tacos, and a Del Taco is near you.
