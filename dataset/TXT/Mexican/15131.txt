1_y5e1u-o93EKOigXgR3LQ i am that very strange human that only ever has fish tacos, no matter what other tacos i get, nothing compares to a fish taco. so my review strictly for their fish tacos and their unreal hot sauce. i really do like theirs here! had it a couple times, their hot sauce is so bomb. i tried to ask if they would sell me a bottle once, they of course said it's a house secret, so no. i've tried the other tacos, they're not bad but they did nothing for me. again, that's just me! it's pretty small here, so it's very much, eat and go. they sell 3 tacos for $10 - at least when i went, not sure if that's gone up. if not, you simply can't beat the price, especially when you compare to downtown taco joints like la carnita or any of the playa cabanas. if you're around, definitely stop by!
