My uncle brought me here for lunch.... I usually always get the same thing but I decided to try something different this time.... they start with chips and salsa like most Mexican places the salsa was a little spicy for me but it was good 

I started with a beer and an oyster shooter since my uncle wanted us all to take one 

The oyster shooter was a little to spicy for me I've been having horrible heartburn recently so I wasn't to happy about the spice 

I ordered the pasta brava??? I can't totally remember 

It was yummy though and a huge amount which was great.....I totally got to take it home and munch on it later that nice my uncle ordered fish I didn't try it but it must of been great he ate it so fast lol ....

I will return to try more things
