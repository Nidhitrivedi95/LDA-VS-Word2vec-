W537pidoTVQmn9x1GPpxgA My family and I just finished a long day at the Phoenix Zoo and were hungry, we drove for a while to get to our favorite pho restaurant only to find out that they were closed due to observing Vietnamese New Year. After accepting that disappointment we decided to check out Two Hippies due to their excellent ratings and only being a little distance from us. We pulled to the parking spot right in front, noticed several folks on the outdoor patio and in the kitchen, as we exited our car the person inside flipped the "open" sign around to closed and shut the window abruptly, at 4:18 in the afternoon. I understand if they were closed, but they blatantly closed in our faces with out any courtesy of speaking to us and explaining why they were closing mid day. That experience totally turned me off to ever wanting to go back, what a shame.
