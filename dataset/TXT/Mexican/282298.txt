XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg we have always wanted to dine at a bobby flay restaurant. We are food network fans and have always admired bobby flay and his culinary style. We made a reservation on new years day and were seated promptly. The warm bread basket had a good variety of breads.

For appetizer we had the tiger shrimp with corn tamale. Our first bite into it and it was an explosion of flavors in my mouth. We also ordered the special crab cakes which were so delectable.

For entree we shared the sixteen spice chicken. This is easily one of the most flavor rich chicken dishes I've tasted in the states. 

The dessert we ordered DEEP DISH BANANA CREAM PIE was not that great .. avoid it if you can .. 

All in all, we experienced culinary satisfaction as we stepped out of a celebrity chef restaurant. Wish the dessert lived up to expectations but I wont blame bobby for it :)
