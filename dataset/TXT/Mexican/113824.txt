geQG2a9uO6Q9hXVx937Kbw I went there once today since burrito bandidos opens up at 5 on sundays, I like burrito bandidos more. The burritos here are slightly small and they are not generous when it comes to the meat portion. Also it didn't taste as good as burrito bandidos. If you can walk 5 minutes longer I recommend burrito bandidos more than burrito boys.
