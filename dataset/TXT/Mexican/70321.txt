BWsCjBVMR289vtojIz-gWw My wife and I had an unfortunate experience at another location.  I called this store and spoke to Veronica and she was so polite and friendly that we decided to give Cafe Rio another try.  She made us feel extremely welcome and we will definitely come back to this location in the future.  Thank you VERONICA for restoring our appreciation for Cafe Rio!
