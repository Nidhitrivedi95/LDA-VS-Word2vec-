We were told that Guy wants it to be the loudest venue in Vegas and he's achieved that goal.  It was not enjoyable because of the noise level.  The guacamole was some watered down version and the fajitas were as plain as they could be.  The quality of the beef was less then desirable too. The service staff was very good, our server was terrific but I can get better mexican food at a mall food court.
