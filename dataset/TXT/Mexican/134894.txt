iL2pb5Khi6jV113vOVQCvA I love the food at Mexico Lindo, and although I don't live in the area I try to visit every now and again. The owner, Sandra, and her family do a great job and serve authentic Mexican food and drinks.

I always order the chicken fajitas but everything I see coming out of the kitchen looks (and smells) great. The service can be a little 'relaxed' to say the least. Free chips and guacamole while you wait for your meal.

The only thing I would change is the prices, which at around $30 per person with no drinks, is a little on the expensive side. Having said that, this is true for a lot of Mexican restaurants in the city. Overall a solid four stars.
