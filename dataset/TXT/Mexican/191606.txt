ohqeJybL1FuFzN4P8pwxhg My husband and I absolutely love getting our breakfast bagels here but the customer service is absolutely atrocious. We went at around 1pm and the lady that helped us (Sandra) was so rude. First we weren't ready to order and we let her know we needed a couple of minutes and she just rolled her eyes and went back to mopping the floor. When we finally ordered we decided we wanted to take half a dozen bagels and cream cheese to take home and she just seemed so bothered that we were ordering again. I mean we were the only people inside this place it's not like they had a line. How is this place suppose to make money with employees that don't even want to sell because one simple order seems like their hands are going to break from making it. Worst customer service! It really sucks because I love the establishment
