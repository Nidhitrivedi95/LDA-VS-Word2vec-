wJ84TZZTuT0EdLzPHt8RDw Our service and food was great. Laura was our server and we received 5 star service from her. The food was tasty, priced right and look forward to coming back. We love going to the Scottsdale location and are now happy to have a Carlos O'Brians closer to home. Of course a location closer to Happy Valley and Lake Pleasant Pkwy would be even better!!!
