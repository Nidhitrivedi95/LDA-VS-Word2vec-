NF8dnVxSeL2zKKJ2DDkJMQ Alright, so a few months later i'm gonna update my review. Well let me begin by saying i'm still in love with this place, my boyfriend and i come here at least 3 times a week. I'm honestly pretty shocked they don't know me by name, but i think they recognize us when we walk in lol. I get the same thing every time, i ventured out and got the chicken but i wasn't a fan, so ill stick with my spicy steak. The restaurant it's self is very very clean, the food is absolutely amazing and you get really big portions for what you pay. The steak (Which i will now stick with forever) NEVER has any fat in it. At all! Which if you think about other restaurants like this (You know who i'm talking about) it's almost always fat. Don't even get me started on the queso or pico and corn, oh my god. i love this place! The only drawback really is the fact they got rid of their lemonade :( it was so good! If you're debating on going i HIGHLY recommend it. Ill see ya sometime this week hot heads!
