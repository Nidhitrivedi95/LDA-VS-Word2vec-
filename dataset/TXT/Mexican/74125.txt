cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A Best food in Arizona by far!   Affordable and you don't have to get all dressed up to enjoy this delicious meal.  Great place to take the family.  The food is excellent the customer service is great!  Where can you go and get an excellent meal than be treated to a free cookie for dessert?  Only at Chino Bandido can you get this service!.   They have the perfect twist in combining Mexican and Asian cuisine.  I love the Veggie Quesadilla   We have been going here for over 20 years and the food is delicious.  I am a very picky eater and this food satisfies my pallet every time.   The place is busy all the time, and you can see why, once you try their delicious meals.
