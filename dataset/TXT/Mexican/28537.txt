3SLDrXzPmKF0iCY8WriLsA Went on Taco Tuesday. Had carne asada tacos. Excellent for the price and included guac. Def will be back! Friendly service, clean restaurant, and pleasant first-time experience! 

Nice location if the person you're with would rather eat something else! 

Concept is similar to Chipotle with better veggie options and smaller portion options! Check it out!

Limited seating.
