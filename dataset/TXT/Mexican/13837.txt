0QdYrqcJTJTvQNk-1WsCbA Super authentic Colombian, Mexican and Carribean food. In a world where everyone thinks they can make a "street taco" it is nice to find food that actually uses the right spices and people who know that you can't just toss a tortilla around anything and call it authentic latin food.

Nothing fancy or upscale, but if you are looking for "Real" latin food, this is a great place to find it. Take out is great from here too.

There are a million places like this back in my hometown (Los Angeles) but there aren't that many here in Charlotte - so i hope they stick around for a long time!

Try the Bandeja Paisa and the Aroz con leche to drink. :)
