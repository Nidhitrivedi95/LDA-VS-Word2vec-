zN4f3aLeCuIhCTPRH0di-A The recipes were very original and the food was phenomenal. Everybody who works there from the bartender to the wait staff were very nice, it was a welcoming atmosphere. I am definitely coming back and bringing everyone I know who likes great Mexican food. Try the tacos, get one of each you will not regret it. And the margaritas, they definitely know what they are doing. Ever had a churro waffle? Do that too.
