jScBTQtdAt-8RshaiBEHgw This restaurant was a pleasant surprise! My boyfriend and I went on a Wednesday at lunch time and we were the only people in the restaurant. The waitress was nice and gave us 2 chips & salsas. Not sure what they put on their chips, but they were yummy and fresh!
I ordered the Korean galbi flank steak tacos, which came with rice and beans. The tacos were delicious, the meat was well marinated and the kimchi slaw added the perfect touch! The rice that it came with was a bit crunchy for my liking, but had a good spicy kick to it. 
My boyfriend ordered the miso pork belly burger. It was huge! The pork belly was an added touch to an already good burger. 
This is defiantly a place I would visit again!
