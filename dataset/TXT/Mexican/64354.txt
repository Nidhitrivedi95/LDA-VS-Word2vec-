B1sevFEjgsKPvkTz10ESJw I come here sometimes because it's close to the office, and because Moe's serves tofu (unlike other places). 

This location is consistent with what I've seen at other Moe's. I usually can pick out what I want and the person making my food will gladly customize my order, and even answer questions. Like when they introduced the new chimichurri sauce: being from Argentinean descent, I had to have it. And it was good (albeit not traditional).

I like how it isn't too crowded - even when lunch rush hits, they are quick enough and the restaurant is large enough to accommodate customers without a long wait. 

Overall, it's a convenient, clean, quick burrito spot.
