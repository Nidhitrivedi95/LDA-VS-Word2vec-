1n3hAKaOajANcMQZOt1IOg Came here one evening and we were seated right away. We came just in time to take advantage of their happy hour. Service was friendly and food was good. I didn't care for their salsa it didn't have a kick to it like I like but other than that everything was good. I wouldn't mind coming back in the future.
