F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw I had been to Momocho three or so years ago and it was the best Mod Mex food I have ever had.  Fast forward until now, and I wanted to share the delicious experience I had with my fiancé.  We started with the smoked trout guacamole, which was exactly how I remembered it (delicious).  My fiancé had a traditional margarita and stated it was one of the best she has ever had.  The server was attentive and friendly.  I ordered one of the fish dishes they offer, and  she ordered a chicken dish.  Both were very forgettable, with flavors that did not make you want to continue eating more  The fish I ordered had a sour flavor to it, which I could not pinpoint what spice was causing it.  Ambiance is nice, overall flow of the restaurant is unique with stairs leading up and separate stairs to leave.  Might give them another try, but with Cleveland being saturated with so many other great restaurants, it will be awhile before we do.
