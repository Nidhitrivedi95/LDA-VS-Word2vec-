OA5Li3ySzhrbG_WvD_QGYA I don't dislike Barrio, but wasn't a huge win for my group of friends. 

First, the place is tiny and fills up super fast. We were seated in the bar at a high-top table, which meant there were people right up against us.

LOVE the concept of create-your-own-taco, and I was quite happy with my choices (pulled pork with cheese, guac, and jicama slaw), but the rest of my group weren't so thrilled. It would have been easier if the server had taken a second to explain the menu sheets. We thought we understood, but when we had a question, she seemed kinda rushed and didn't really answer. We also didn't realize right away that there are two sheets for your order, one for fillings and one for sauces.

On a nit-picky note, we had 5 people (they only have like 2 tables that can seat 5 - it's THAT small), but ther server brought one small basket of chips & salsa. Took 10 minutes to get a second basket. That should have been a given with 5 people.

But, the atmosphere is pretty cool...someone called in "Hipexican" in a previous review and I agree. It was definitely on the hipster side. Our bartender also had a porn 'stache - not sure how that fits into this review, but it stands out in my mind. :)

Nice place to try...might head back on a date night, but not with a group of people.
