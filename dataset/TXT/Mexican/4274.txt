-Qkx7W0itbAApcG5lJuMFQ I ordered the sushi cupcakes, which sounded amazing. I have allergies, so don't do rice. Asked for no rice and the manager refused to make them without the rice. Didn't even care to ask why i was requesting. So, although I paid the same price and it would have actually been one step less for them, the answer was no. If they had cared enough to just even pretend like they'd humor me and consider my request, they would have received 5 stars. The Sushi was delicious but it was a pain trying to pour the rice out and eat the wonton "cupcake" base and the sushi from the top without getting any rice. Please care at least a little about your customer's requests in the future.
