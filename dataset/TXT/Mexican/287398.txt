ydqbNz2sHENV9XOElwyAYA Very disappointing experience. My day was on a roll, then I stopped here for a very late lunch. Too late, actually, as a diabetic, so my blood sugar was tanking badly.  I ordered the filet with crab and béarnaise sauce, "cooked to order" it said. I ordered it MEDIUM RARE. Took a while to get there (at 3 in the afternoon??) and it was cooked medium, headed for medium-well. The waitress noticed and did offer another one. But I had to explain my medical condition and I honestly told her I literally COULD NOT wait another 20-25 minutes to eat. When it came time to pay, I wasn't looking for a free steak, but a discount would have been a fair gesture...if you are going to pay for filet "cooked to order" and the chef screws it up...  Not only did I NOT get offered a discount for his fubar, but I got charged $3.25 for my cup of decaf! When you make a business mistake, a gesture of goodwill and accountability keeps customers coming back. I was looking for a new favorite eatery in my new neighborhood...and it WON'T be the Blue Adobe Grill.  But it could have been... With some accountability and good customer service...
