S_bG5WWbtNXhhY9Y0GTcSg This is such a cute cafe and I wish I lived closer!  We found this place on Yelp while heading into central PHX one Saturday and decided to stop by for a lighter lunch.

My boyfriend is obsessed with buffalo chicken sandwiches/wraps/pizzas so of course he ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich here.  I took a bite and have to say, it is the BEST buffalo chicken sandwich I've ever had!!

The difference between the food here and a lot of other places is the quality of ingredients.  The chicken tasted fresh, not drenched in buffalo sauce to hide the day-old taste like other places.  They use Noble Bread, which was delicious and chewy.  The green heirloom tomato gave the sandwich a delightful crunch.  

It looks like they try to locally source their ingredients, which is great.  Service is very noncommittal hipster vibe, hence the 4 stars.  All in all, a great place for good food.  Highly recommended if you are in the area!
