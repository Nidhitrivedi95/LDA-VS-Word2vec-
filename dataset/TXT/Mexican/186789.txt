O_UC_izJXcAmkm6HlEyGSA I've been to Playa Cabana before and loved it (as in 5 out of 5 kind of love). However, this time around, it was a huge disappointment.

I purposely chose this restaurant for my birthday because I loved it so much and I wanted to share this restaurant with my friend. However, I found the staff not as friendly this time around. When one of the waitress brought our food to the table, she knocked down my friend's utensils and didn't even apologize. I know that it was only a minor accident and she's only human so I shouldn't judge her for it. However, just a quick "sorry" was all that's needed. Instead, she just rolled her eyes after throwing down the dish and walked away. Great service is an element of a great restaurant and that waitress clearly does not belong there.

Also, we went there early for dinner (as in before 7). For dessert we ordered churros and they said they ran out of dulce de leche. How could they have possibly run out of dulce de leche when we're one of the earlier customers of the night?
