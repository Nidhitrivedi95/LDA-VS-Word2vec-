GC5wcui5uejRZTi8OCNPkQ Sis and I checked into the hotel and our choice for dining choices was Mi Casa. Our Hostess sat us promptly at a booth. Less than 3 minutes later the chips and salsa and water arrived and then our Waiter Cameron McKay. I liked him right away, he has good energy and a warm smile. He sold us on the corn appetizers that I never knew were on the menu in the few times I had dined at Mi Casa. Food came out quickly and attention to timing. What we liked was that he mentioned to other staff that we were from HI and along comes Keone to talk story. They all work well together. Keone delivered our food, female Busser/waitress was also all over our table. High accolades! It may have been a Manager who stopped by as well. However if not, rest assure your staff is doing what they are expected to do and you do not to worry about customer service! Luv ya Cameron and Aloha! Connie and Marlene .
