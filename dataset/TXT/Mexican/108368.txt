frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A We flew into Arizona, jet lagged and hungry. This taco spot was near by and food network featured it. 
Outside the place looked a little sketchy, but inside it looked like a typical taco spot. We got fresh chips to start. And then we ordered about 3 tacos per person (all of them were good!). 
The best thing about this place is their salsa bar. They have everything from pico to strawberry to pecan salsa. Some were spicy, some sweet. It's insane. And delicious. 
Pretty cool and simple taco spot in Phoenix. Small dining area though, so don't get mad if there's a wait.
