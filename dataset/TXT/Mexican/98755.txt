I had the enchiladas with green chile pork, compared to chipotle the flavors are great and there's definitely a wide variety to choose from... but as far as the whole assemble as you order thing, it didn't really work out. Everything just kind of got slopped together, including my rice and beans... so it looked more like a soup with some tortillas more than anything. They weren't really enchiladas as the tortillas pretty much just came apart and none of it was hot, despite them running it through a warmer. I had to ask for salsa, pico, lettuce and extra cheese on top, because it was just tortillas with meat and the tiniest bit of cheese with sauce thrown inside and more on top. The nachos would probably be good here, but I think I'll stick to authentic Mexican for everything else. The manager was great, super friendly and made sure we were happy before paying. I so appreciate the Stevia lemonade which was awesome, but I will forever miss my Qdoba.
