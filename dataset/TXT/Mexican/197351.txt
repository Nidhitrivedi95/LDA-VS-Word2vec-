When we sat down we were brought fresh tortillas with a hint of jalepeno and some garlic butter which was a nice change of pace from chips and salsa.  The margaritas were good and combined with the extra amount in the shaker there was a fairly good amount of it too!  The green enchilada was good but for the price there are better options out there.  

Overall:
Great Outdoor Seating
Liked the tortillas instead of chips
Good margaritas
