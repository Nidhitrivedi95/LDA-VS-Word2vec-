WGkqfp1-3130v8xhCb3APg I only went to Kent to party for 2 nights and never knew about Taco Tontos until my wife took me to the Lakewood location. It was totally awesome. The fish taco was insane and made me feel like i was getting a hug from God. The beer was awesome too. Music was cool. Staff was awesome. I think the owners are a hubby and wife team running the place and they really went out of their way for us. In fact, the lady who looks like a better version of Juliet Lewis was really helpful. The husband owner looks like a cross between Tom Selleck and Denzel Washington, was super cool and knows his beers. Anyways, we had an amazing time there and we were shocked at how inexpensive it was. We are going back ASAP.
