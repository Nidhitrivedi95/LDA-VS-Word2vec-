nwHd2MbIGz0SNG8GpFjekw Poor service when they get busy!!!  Overall, I love this place.  However, I was really frustrated with the service today!  I decided to bring lunch to my kids at school and they specifically requested Los Taquitos!  They could have said, McD's or any other fast food joint, but they didn't!  It was 20 minutes before their lunch hour started.  I thought that would be plenty of time since their school is only 5 minutes away. Luckily, there was only 1 other person in front of me when I got there.  However, after I ordered, they got slammed!  I watched several people get their order before me, while I watched the blonde add stickers to the salsa instead of paying attention to the orders at the window.  I was wondering if she was ignoring mine because it was a TO-GO order.  Regardless, I had to go up to the counter and let her know my order was sitting there.  It took over 20 minutes to get 2 kids meals (2 quesadillas, rice & beans) and I basically missed their lunch hour.  Talk about 2 disaappointed children & 1 disappointed mommy! :(
