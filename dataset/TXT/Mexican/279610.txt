xUvgrDdKhcmaP6Zv0ssb6A I have been eating at Manuel's for 30 years.  It's the best Mexican food in the valley!  I love the location on Southern and Carlos and Marcos always take the best care of me.  I can't say enough about the delicious salsa, amazing Spanish rice, and crazy good food.  You can't go wrong with anything you order.  The green corn tamale is to die for and OMG, I almost forgot to mention the soup!  The albondigas soup is the best ever.  I have brought so many people there who are now loyal customers.  They are the BEST!!!!
