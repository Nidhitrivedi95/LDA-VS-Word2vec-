MQAh7G93keNYlFKTus2CDQ I've been looking for elote since I moved to vegas a year ago (admittedly not very hard since this place is right next to my house). But I was disappointed by some places not having it. Finally got some herBut I also sampled some of their pineapple/tajin and cucumber/lime/chile ice creams and my world has been turned upside down it was SO GOOD. I will literally update this review tomorrow because I am going back every day now
