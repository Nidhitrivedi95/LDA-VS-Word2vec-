Mis Amigos in Arizona Center was a covnenient choice for lunch downtown.  It was a late lunch (like 1:30) so the place was mostly empty and the hostess didn't seem too pleased to see us.  She brushed off my charming jokes and sat us in a nearby booth.  The hostess was actually the downside of the service - everyone else was quite prompt and pleasant.  Unfortunately, the service was the best aspect of our lunch at Mis Amigos.  Before ordering the carne asada torta, I asked the server if it was good and she insisted it was.  What came out of the kitchen was warmed-over, chopped steak on a sub roll - not the soft, authentic torta roll I was expecting.  Other than "carne asada sauce" there was nothing else on the sandwich - no guacamole, no tomato, no nothing.  Disappointing.  The tableside guacamole was also disappointing.  Even though the waitress prepared it - as you would expect - tableside, it was bland.  The guac definitely needed salt, maybe a little lemon or lime juice, but something to give it some flavor.

Maybe I was expecting too much, but I certainly wouldn't recommend Mis Amigos to mis amigos.
