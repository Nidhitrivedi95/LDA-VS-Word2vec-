Was craving Pork Chile Verde but could not find anything on the menu that resembles it. Somewhat disappointed, we ordered medium & hot guacamole with chips and drinks. Loved that the guacamole was made fresh at your table...and it was delish! Chips were nice and warm too!!  I figured if I could not decide on what to order from the menu, I would just order more guacamole...but I settled on trying the Marinated Jidori Chicken  which is plated with grilled mushroom, Oaxacan cheesy rice, chile verde & fermented black bean sauce (I was able to get something with chile verde seasoning.)  AND it was fantastic! The flavors put together were phenomenal. I enjoyed every last bite, and it definitely made up for not being able to fulfill my initial craving. Also, the Pineapple Ginger Mojitos and Cucumber Jalapeno Margaritas were light and refreshing, too.

Our server, Tony, was friendly and efficient...helpful
in clarifying specific dishes, etc. Our water glasses were never empty (although the server was the only one we came in contact with who did not have a friendly demeanor.) We appreciated the manager, Andre, coming to the table as I finished up my meal (I'm usually the last one to finish.)  He might've just been on the floor to gage the time it will take for the last few tables to empty, because it was post thirty minutes after closing...but I thought it was nice anyway. 

Next, we will try out the Mission at Kierland and the sister reataurants; but we will be back!
