iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg i think if you came from soCAL, this would not be such a big deal but we are in toronoto and a pretty trendy part of toronoto. so expect good food to be more expensive *overall, the east coast is more expensive on food!* tacos are $6 but are really filling. 

regrettably, i did not order the gobernador taco which is their signature. instead, i opted for the carnitas and beef tongue. really delicious and on par with la - fresh handmade tortillas and made to order meat. it comes warm, and bold, and tender meat. 

there is a line even at off peak hours, but it moves fairly quickly. do come in for a bite if you're missing your mexican food mix.

No real seating area... and CASH ONLY.
