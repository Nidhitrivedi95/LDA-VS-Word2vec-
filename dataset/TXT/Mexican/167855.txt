lukgo76fgTo-llcXDdsdUA This was a huge disappointment.
There was some confusion with our orders.  The manager made no attempt,
what so ever, to help solve the issue.  Just yelled at us to get out of 'his' restaurant.  
My fish taco was not like any fish taco I have ever eaten, hard tortilla, which were broken and loaded with chipotle.  
One grandson ordered a taco salad.  Never seen one like what he got.
Most unappetizing presentation.

Tables were dirty and so were the floors.
Never again.  Rudeness doesn't do a business any good.
