I liked this place but the value is not that great.  $130 for 12 tacos, a pitcher of a not too potent, but flavourful, margarita and guacamole.  The pork belly tacos were delicious and so were the baja style ones but for that money we could have had a gourmet meal.  I feel like a lot of negative reviews on here are a little over the top and bitter because of how popular this place is.  The food here is good, it's just expensive.  That's no reason to bash its quality.
