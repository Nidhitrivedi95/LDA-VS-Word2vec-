S_bG5WWbtNXhhY9Y0GTcSg Really nice brunch spot downtown! They have a good amount of vegetarian and omnivore options. A few vegan items too. Service was quick and friendly for being a busy Sunday. Everything on the menu looked good so it was hard to make a decision! I ordered the breakfast sandwich sub avocado instead of bacon, and it was very good! Definitely didn't skimp on the avocado!

My husband ordered the breakfast wrap, which was also quite tasty. Overall,  affordable, cool spot for breakfast/brunch downtown!
