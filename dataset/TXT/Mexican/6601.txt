_H4GXECi4nHfJTz4dsQV_w Burritos are really good. The flavor of the flour tortillas is probably the best I have ever had outside of Mexico. I'm a serious mexican food snob and many places in Phoenix I dont like. Had Ritas today with our crew at the shop and we all loved it! Dont expect a huge burrito like most places. Here it is the meat and the flour tortilla to showcase the tortilla flavor but the carne asada was awesome! Loved this place will be back many more times.
