8USUyIeN39rurnqCn5cA0w Way way too pricey for a small neighborhood dive. Expect to spend $40bucks for 2 w/o cocktail or tip. And whenever you walk into a joint and its totally empty walk right back out. Food was very good but very expensive for a dive in a strip mall....Omg  great help, good food, expensive as all hell for the neighborhood, $65.00 for 2 people with only 2 alcoholic drinks.   You are better off @ expensive Ricardo's at this rate... Ridiculous...go back to California.  Where folks expect to pay these exorbitant prices...... the salsa bar is rather impressive, wont stay in business long, they are always totally empty.....p.s.  the Happy Hour selections are a big joke.....
