gEv1Og5uGDLw9HkbKSGUZw While the fish taco was still in my mouth, I was thinking ~3 stars. Food and drinks are fine, albeit overpriced. Appetizers were probably the highlight of the meal. Music will drive you insane. But if you have to eat in the area and there's a special (namely Taco Tuesday) going on, it's good.*

*Minus the churros, which I nearly broke a tooth on.

The SERRRIVCE though! No. Not the servers necessarily, who are probably doing as instructed. Mandatory prix-fixe for tables of 8+ was annoying, especially since they limit you to 4 taco varieties, which is not great for groups since more people = more different wants and dietary restrictions. Obviously. But on top of that, paying the $520+tip bill (not Taco Tuesday, obviously) was a pain in the trasero.

Can we get separate bills? "No."
Oh...can we split it? "I can split the bill a maximum of 4 ways."
Uhh...can the couples, you know, couple off? "The computer literally won't allow me to do it like that."
Can we just pass around the credit card machine? "No, I'm serving another table and it would take forever to go around." No, it really wouldn't. Actually, it's taking longer for us to discuss this.

We finally assigned amongst ourselves the "payors" of the group only to be brought bills divided exactly by 4...which doesn't really help an odd-numbered group, does it?

EL CAB!!! It's 2015. Your computer can do it! Is it a computer-shaped tortilla? You run a restaurant, you serve groups, your menu is expensive, you accept credit cards - please just deal with whatever negligible fees you're incurring as a cost of the business and allow your customers to pay you $600 how they want to pay you.

P.S. Love the taro chips + guac!

P.P.S. There's a fake 5-star review from the business on this page.
