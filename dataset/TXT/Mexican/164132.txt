LHHKDRZbofrex2FA7IBhSQ Someone else posted that they don't know why locals of GoldHill Road area always want to go to El Magueys...the workers seem rather frazzled by idea of reservations (and knowing WHEN to take the reservation). After also watching and being a fan of "Kitchen Nightmares" with Gordon Ramsay, I don't want to know what it is really like.

The guacamole is always bland. You can add salt and pepper at the table, but even then it's just like regular avocados (that are unripe) mashed with no additives for flavor.

Last time I was there I stood up to close the blinds as the western sun glared in. NEVER AGAIN. My hands were met with dust and sticky goo. I can only imagine the last time anytime was cleaned with spray or a basic rag of hot water and soap.

I've ordered shrimp dishes before, the same one on the menu (Camarones de Verdana), and it always comes out looking and tasting different each time.
