lrAUseySfmFeZkWOGfsKnQ I went to Wadaa tacos based on the 4.5 star reviews. The menu was basically either asada or pollo tacos, quesadillas or chips and salsa. Which is fine, but the chips and salsa was just a bag of chips and salsa from the condiment bar. Not worth $3.50. The tacos weren't bad just not very authentic. The restaurant setup was like being in a warehouse. Not a bad place for a quick bite to eat but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there.
