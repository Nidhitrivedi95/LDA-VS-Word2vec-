WTGmtvIE1v9uEBZxiyXImQ Full disclosure. I've only eaten here once. Today. It was spectacular.

The restaurant is tiny and pretty, and the staff were friendly and welcoming. I had the beef tinga quesadilla. Just one was enough for me, but I have a small appetite. 

When my plate arrived it came with a small salad that tasted fresh and light. It took me right back to Oaxaca (maybe a decade or two ago) and the small, bright restaurants I ate in there. The quesadilla itself was a perfect mix of tinga and cheese, and the maize tortilla was absolutely fantastic. 

If you want super delicious Mexican food without the blaring music and annoying hipster wait-staff, go to Maizal. You won't be sorry.

Just a small note regarding the listing above - they had margaritas as well as wine and beer.

Can't wait to go back.
