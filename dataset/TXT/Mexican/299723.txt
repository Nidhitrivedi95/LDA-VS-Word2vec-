ZKvbVqYc2OsqXSlYlNsBGA I had just gotten a raise and decided to treat me and my girlfriend to a nice late lunch. I have had arrozz camarones at another place and it is my favorite dish. I tried it at fiesta jalapeños and other places up north. This was the best. And plus I didn't know what the Texas margarita was, it's a must banging!  Gracie's Carlos!
