oCwJdiYhZS8VM5_LgmQP0g Went to Arriba's Mexican tonight for a friend's birthday dinner. Out of the six pages of choices I settled on this. For what I paid it wasn't worth it. The chicken was good and was topped with the fundido sauce. Which how can anything smothered in cheese sauce be bad?? Then there were three itty bitty shrimps wrapped in bacon. All three prob equaled the size of a medium shrimp. Then the kids or half size quesadilla and some rice for $13? Not worth it. glad the chips, salsa, and bean dip before filled me up some. Otherwise I would have left hungry. Service was just okay. Our server was very quiet and shy.
