1x8_aJQ-iqvymhRK3SNbLg Came in with 4 people at 1pm on a Saturday. Literally the ONLY people in the restaurant. I don't think any of the employees are trained. This is a long review but the food could not have been more incorrect compared to the descriptions on the menu. 

We started with "table side" guacamole that came out brown from the back and was not made at the table. 

We all ordered regular tacos, 2-3 each. None of them came out right. 

Fish taco described as- beer battered fish on a bed of cabbage topped with Baja sauce and mango salsa.

Fish taco came out as grilled fish, on lettuce no sauce and mango salsa. 

Tinga Taco described as- shredded chicken breast braised in chipotle sauce, stuffed in a crispy corn tortilla and topped with cheddar cheese, shredded lettuce, tomatoes and crema. 

Came out as- shredded chicken on a soft corn tortilla, onions and cheese.  
- when we asked for crema to add ourself, they charged us for it. 

Tacos Al Pastor described as- thinly sliced pork marinated in adobo sauce mixed with grilled pineapple, cilantro & onions. 

Came out as- ground pork with cilantro and onions. 

When we looked at our plates some of the tacos were regular size and some were clearly street tacos. We told them the problem and they responded that they would "have to take back the plates, and it would take a long time to make new tacos" essentially refusing to make the order right. I pointed out that there was no pineapple on the Al Pastor and her first response was "it never comes with pineapple". After checking the menu she came out with three sides of fresh (not grilled) pineapple. 

At the end of our meal we calmly tried to point out how wrong off the food was compared to the descriptions on the menu. The waitress clearly didn't care but said she would "make it right" for us. When she came with the new bill she had put an 8% discount on the guacamole and made no other adjustments. 

Needless to say we will never go back.
