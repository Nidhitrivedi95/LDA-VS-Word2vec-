jR_p2I8h6w5lpf6GWk9Dzg Grabbed lunch at La Unica on Friday with 2 friends around noon - this is one of our go-to lunch spots in Huntersville. Even in the height of the lunch rush we were seated immediately in a cozy booth in the back. Free salsa (mild and hot) and chips quickly followed. We ordered a small queso to share (~$4) and it was delicious as always! I would drink it with a straw if it was socially acceptable. 

I almost always order the lunch chicken fajitas (~$8). A generous portion of chicken, peppers, and onions are served with refried beans, rice, and your choice of corn or flour tortillas. Overall the food is good, not great, and priced fairly at lunch. You could easily get lunch for less than $6 and not feel hungry the rest of the day.
