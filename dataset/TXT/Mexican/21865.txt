2HxaDXZmAOH6LiuzGgNdPA The BLT is NOT worth what they charge for it. I could make a BETTER version at home with better ingredients for $1.50. I'd happily pay $5.50 for a BLT loaded with thick cut bacon on great bread, but this was on regular white sliced bread with a tiny dollop of mayo, three puny, greasy slices of bacon and lettuce (I got it without tomatoes). Disappointed. I gave three stars because I had previously had a chili cheese omelet here and it was good. Store is clean, staff is nice, wait time for a sandwich was ridiculous.
