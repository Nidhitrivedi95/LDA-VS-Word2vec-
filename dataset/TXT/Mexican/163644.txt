Lfauu60pCWaQ2nuGCgW_eQ Don't even bother. Just light your money on fire, waste 2 hours of your own time, and eat canned beans. 
The absolutely slowest service I've ever experienced on non-peak hours. It was almost as if she was annoyed to have customers. No drink refills. The food runs either bland with no seasoning or entirely too spicy in a way that makes your tongue bleed. 5 out of 10 on the "spicy scale" should not be inedible.
