IMoMOGoIDabx_Gnkw4-mmg I went here with some friends who love the place.  Basic Mexican decor.  This used to be a HoJo a long time ago.  Friendly server, attentive.  Love the warm chips and fresh salsa.  Margaritas are huge, but not very strong.  Portions are generous.  It seems like the fajitas are very good, but some of the other items, like the tamales, were very bland.  Not a bad place at all, and quite fun for large groups.  I would stick with the fajitas.
