v04EmZIqReWVD_Ri3rofUA Wife owner worked very hard. Avoid the crazy husband.  Food was decent. Margie's were weak on the tequila, but good flavor. Carne Asada tacos were good. Chimichamga (chicken) was the best pick. Grilled chunks of well-seasoned chicken in a golden crusty tortilla.  Good salsa (both regular and hot) and guacamole and chips
