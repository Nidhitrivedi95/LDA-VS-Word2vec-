2CNaSduqZIsCRuNvdO_TAQ Three words. My favorite restaurant. Each ingredient is so delicious!!! The fact that you can have YOUR OWN customized food, such as burritos, tacos, and even salads in JUST MINUTES is amazing! Fast food that doesn't taste or look anything like fast food. It should be called "delicious food" at Chipotle!
