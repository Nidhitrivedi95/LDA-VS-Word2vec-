B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA The first time I was here I got one of their signature burritos and remembered it being really delicious, don't remember much else. 

Last week my co-workers and I came here for lunch and I was hugely disappointed. First, my co-worker asked one of the staff which base is the best with one of the bowls she wanted to try, the guy waved his arms around and said "it varies...I don't know.." Not the best way to advertise your food and help your customers. 

My complaint has nothing to do with the quality of the food; veggies were fresh, fish were cold and fresh, great flavors. I just don't think its worth the price. If you have ever been to Too See Roll, I think you will agree that TSR is much better. 

I don't like that this place has limited fish options, the most expensive bowl gives you 2 fishes and anything else is extra. Their toppings are also very limited and don't really fit well with the concept of the bowls: guacamole, sour cream, red onions, pico...seems like toppings at Chipotle more than toppings for sushi bowls. Common toppings such as seaweed salad is also extra. TSR has so many more toppings that are all included and they also allow more variety of fish at around the same price. 

Don't think I will come back here, not that food isn't good, I just like more variety and options with my bowl which this place just does not offer. But if you live far from TSR then this place will just have to do.
