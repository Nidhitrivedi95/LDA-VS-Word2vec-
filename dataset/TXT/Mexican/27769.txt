3IwCop28R1_L5jMv6AkL8Q I've always looked at this place while driving along Pecos, and finally dropped in with a girlfriend to have a drink and bite to eat. We opted for the bar side, and although it was pretty mellow when we got there, it was Friday and didn't take long to liven up. We sat at the bar, and almost immediately received a basket of complimentary chips and 3 dips. They were all ah-mazing (especially the bean dip), and at that point all I needed was a margarita and it'd be perfection. We both had the top shelf margarita first, and substituted fruit juice with agave nectar. It was good, but I needed the extra oomph and asked for a double...don't judge me, just keep reading. We ordered the spicy margarita next, despite the bartender's warnings. Well, only after she gave us a shot of the habanero infused tequila for taste purposes, and we proved to her by shooting it that it wouldn't be too hot for us. LOL! My friend also ordered the shrimp pacifico, which I wasn't a fan of simply because it was sweet. I don't know what it is, but for me fruit slaws and tacos just don't go. The entire time we were there service was great, despite the fact she was the only one there and had about 20 customers. Shout out to you Gretchen, you rock!! Overall, everything was great and I will definitely be back soon.
