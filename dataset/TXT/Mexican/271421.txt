WPkRg0eaJZFbyXm0uNb1ZA I ordered beer and a vegie platter but it turned out to be over priced greasy food. Service was probably the worst in all of charlotte. The lady at the desk yelled at my wife for not tipping high enough...if you want a decent meal or service, just go down the road. Find a restaurant with some standards. If I could give this place negative amounts of stars I would max it.
