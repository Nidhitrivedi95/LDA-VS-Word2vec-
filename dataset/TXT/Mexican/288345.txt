Yevhl8bTwdJuu_LWKv-4Fw I went here with my parents and a family friend tonight.  We met at Eton and figured out where to go once we got to Eton.  We started off with some drinks and since we were in the bar, we got happy hour specials.  3 sugar margaritas later, my mom was driving home, but that's besides the point!  The chips and guacamole were delicious (tortilla, plantane and one other type of chip) were pretty good and I'm normally not a guac person.

For dinner, I got the Braised Beef Ropa Vieja.  It was enough for 3 meals for me, but absolutely delicious!!!  The meat melted in your mouth, the rice and beans were so good.  My mom got the chicken tacos and sent her last one home with me.  My friend got the portobello dish and it was one of the best vegetarian dishes she's had.

Good place to go with good portion sizes.  Our waiter was awesome and we had a good 1.5 hours or so with him!

Note, would beware of prom and homecoming season!
