iBlQvqiy5Rg2h-y9TS1yOA We sat at the bar and a very nice handsome bartender, Brett, served us. He was super friendly, always had a smile on his face, was very informative about the restaurant (they almost make everything in house!), and you could tell he honestly had nothing but good things to say about Matador. We tried the Paloma and the Blood Orange Margarita which were delicious and beautiful!
We also very much enjoyed the decor, from the cocktails, to the Mexican wooden bowls, to the mason jars with the garnish. We can't wait till we come back again and see the ambience at night with the candles and fire pit table.
