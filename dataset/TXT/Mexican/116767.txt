gldPX9ANF5Nic0N7igu2og My first time here and I have to be honest I came because I thought this was still Tonic. 
I walked in and the host greeted, or rather grimaced at me.  When I asked for a table, he offered to take me upstairs. I politely declined. He walked away, removed something from a bench, came back and told me he would seat me upstairs...there were two tables in plain sight that were ready and empty. After being seated upstairs I was greeted, wonderfully I might add, by a waitress-Julia. She was all similes and extremely accommodating.  I gave my order of a marguerita,  extra salt, and nachos, custom ordered. She continuously checked on me and made sure I was ok. The marguerita was bland, but the nachos were delicous! I don't know if I'd come here again, but I can say the nachos were really good.
