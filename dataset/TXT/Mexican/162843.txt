LBBp51YHui5gvXNSyUcLKg Not sure why I keep trying this place. Last time I got the Mexican pizza on happy hour. It was two soggy tortillas with refried beans, cheese and jalapeno cream cheese (which is shockingly bland and salty). I would rate taco bell higher than valle Luna. Everything is over salted. 
The menu descriptions make everything sound amazing and delicious. I think hiring a professional menu author (or whatever the process is) is the only thing keeping them in business, besides the location.
if you dine in, you may find the place dark and depressing. Employees reflect this vibe as well.
I don't think I'll be back, even with all the coupons they send out every month in the clipper.
