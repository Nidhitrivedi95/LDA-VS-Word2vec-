qBa28rpBVdjD-qxNSzm-rQ They just opened a few days ago so I figured I'd check out.  Nice open place with huge booths, long L shape bar which is where I sat.  The bar stools are nice but either they are short or the bar is tall...felt sorta like a kid sitting there almost reaching up.

Was greeted promptly by a nice young man, I asked about beer prices (drafts) which took asking several people.  They did have Dos Equis draft $2.50 for a 16 ounce so excellent!

Salsa and chips were good but average, I asked about some salsa verde which seemed to cause some confusion and they don't have any. :( 

Anyway, ordered the basic #11 (oddly this combo is almost always the same items no matter where you go), I really enjoyed it.  I got all beef and while the beef itself could have had a little more flavor, the sauces were excellent...

Right now they need more training, especially if they get busier as several questions took a group for an answer, and it took a while to get my check and pay.

I'll be back in a couple weeks, hopefully they will be working the bugs out.
