Cd2ERofxOeCbCi-0yDs0aw Love, love, LOVE this place. Can't tell you which salsa is the best because they are all awesome and I order depending on my mood. The flat, fry bread is so yummy. Even without anything on it, just with sugar it is so damn tasty. the guy who runs the register is so sweet and attentive. 5 stars all the way!
