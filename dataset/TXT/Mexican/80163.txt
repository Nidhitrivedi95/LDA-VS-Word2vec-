A really intimate, sexy place. It's small so it does get crowded quick and if you have to wait, they'll set you up at the back and get your drink order ASAP. Andres and Ernesto are some of the nicest guys in the business and work really hard at making sure they're customers are happy with their #MexicanFiesta! OLE (oh, that's someone else's catchphrase ;) ). 

I ATE/DRANK 
The Kombucha Maragrita is fantastic (read: it's strong and flavourful). Also note that you can store your tequila bottles here (cool idea guys). 

Guac - I'm a chunky guac fan myself but I liked the mousse version. You'll gobble this up. 
Quecas - yummy, yummy, yummy mini quesadillas but the portions are tiny. At least you don't feel ripped off by the price so I'd get two orders of this if you're starving or not buying the whole menu (which you can do if you order the "Mexican Fiesta"). 
Trout aguachile - the ceviche was a miss in my books. I didn't like the presentation (too chunky) and it was WAY too acidic. The guys know this so if you're not a fan of acidity I would opt for something else. 
Churros - ohhh yeah. A bit pricey for what it is but at least you get a good portion. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Fonda is a fantastic date place and really affordable for what the quality of food you're getting. I like that they're taking the Mexican theme beyond the tacos (but at least it's there if you want it). Disclosure: Andres is a friend of mine and I think I've been fair in this review. So proud of him and his team! Andres will make you feel like you're at casa. His saying is "Mi casa est su casa." Truly, you'll feel at home here.
