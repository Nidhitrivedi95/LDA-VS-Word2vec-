Ktia9NJfvxVxTLVcEnw9zQ I have eaten at Carolinas in the past so I thought I would stop in a grab a bite to eat on my way to a church conference a few blocks away. I must say this recent visit to Carolinas was absolutely horrible.  I ordered a #9 two beef tacos rice and beans.  The taco shells were extremely hard and the beef inside the tacos along with the rice and beans had absolutely no flavor. The entire meal was so bland, I would rather eat at Taco Bell. It was like eating food that had been consistently submerged in water.  the beef was almost white in nature from the apparent boiling or simmering too long or something.  There was no seasoning not even a pinch of salt.  The portion was shameful, it was like a kids plate. Only a spoon full of rice and a spoon full of beans.  The entire experience left me very disappointed.  It was as though I just walked in the door and donated hard earn money but in return got cold, bland and tasteless food.  Fortunately, I was on my way to church which gave me something to look forward to that evening. As far as Carolinas, it has gone "downhill". The cooks don't seem to care about the quality of food that they serve their customers. My advice, If you don't have to eat here, Don't. I was just pressed for time and decided to eat here.  Silly me I should of asked for a refund but I didn't. I will never eat here again.
