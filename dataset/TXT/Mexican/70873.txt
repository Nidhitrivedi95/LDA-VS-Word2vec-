c0LlClom1qONqByoagqPGw So Mexican food is my absolute favorite! I live very close to this restaurant and drove by it many times before deciding to try it. I haven't been this impressed with Mexican food in a very long time! I had such a hard time deciding what I wanted to eat since they had so many items on their menu. The waitress gave me some options which I chose the Diablo baby octopus. It was so delicious and flavorful! Their carne asada bean and cheese tacos are really good as well. 
So the thing I really like about this place is not just the food, but the restaurant is really big, good for groups and they have multiple TVs for people that like sports or telemundo (lol).... The service is unbelievably good. So friendly and attentive. Do not hesitate to come try this place out! It might be far from where you're at, but it is worth the drive!
