RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg my brother had tried this place out in san diego and he told me it was really good and we had to try it, so we came here late friday night and gave it a try the food was really good. we tried one of each of there tacos and all of them where good. we also tried a asade sope and a pastor sope and i was really impressed. the had a quessadia looking dish that had cheese meat guacamole and of course the tortilla that was also really good (probably my favorite) it was a great experience and i will definetly be back
