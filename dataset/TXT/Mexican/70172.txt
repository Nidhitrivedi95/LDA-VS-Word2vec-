BWmex2gxmeWWFwb6hjKm5Q Eh, on the list of burrito places, Qdoba is rock bottom... especially this location.  I don't know who performs the 'chicken cooking' training, but whoever it is must teach the cooks to use 5 gallons of artificial smoke flavor.  Seriously... there's no grilling or smoking involved in the cooking process, but the meat tastes like smoke in solid form.  
Then let's get to the staff.  Now I know most burrito joints employ immigrant workers.  I don't know if this is a budget strategy or if they think that it adds a flare of false authenticity... i don't know.  But it's so frustrating when the workers have no clue what you're saying.  When I say no rice, i get the craziest looks, and sure enough they plop a massive pile of rice on the already carb-infused tortilla wrap.  Before I can even say stop and ask them to start over, my burrito has shot down the 'linea de montaje' (aka assembly line) and already has beans, lettuce, pico, sour cream and 18lbs of shredded cheese piled on it.  So I finally get to the cashier, usually an American college student, and I say that the burrito was made all wrong, and they give me a look like I'm "that customer."  Bump that, vato....
