JlNeaOymdVbE6_bubqjohg This is our go-to place for breakfast when no one wants to prepare anything. I've never had any complaints except for the one time they poured cheese sauce on my nachos instead of shredded cheese; and today because my burrito was smaller than usual and there were pieces of dried beans in it. I should have stuck to my weekend fave--menudo, it is delicious! I took a star away for the dry beans.
