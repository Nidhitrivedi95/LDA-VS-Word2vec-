iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg A friend and I went to Seven lives on a Thursday afternoon. The line was fairly short, and out food was made quite promptly. The price was reasonable, but I only realized after I got my taco that I was not given back correct change by a few dollars and (partially my fault to be fair as I did not check) I did not want to hassle the cash counter. The tacos themselves were good, I got the gobernator and it was very flavourful. My friend got the pork carnitas, but I found that the meat was too dry for my liking. Both the tacos were good but did not stand out to me.That being said I will definitely come to try the other tacos.
