EvDUi_H6-JG3QfGWiInAlw This place is truly terrible, spent an hour waiting for my food, saw my server once. Food was brought to the wrong tables twice, baked potato tasted terrible. I would have paid to not eat there. Ruined my overall mood for the night, prime rib almost made me hurl.  Avoid this place, I would give anywhere else in the casino a try, it couldn't possibly be worse.
