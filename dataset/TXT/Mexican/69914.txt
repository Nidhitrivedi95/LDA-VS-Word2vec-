BToSTEiaK94G3h5_XROEcA I came in for taco tuesday specials. Well this is real Mexican taco. Not the stuff from Taco Bell, and nothing like I've ever had before. Came in with my family. My mom didn't like her food which is to be expected. My son had hot dog and fries it looked yummy. They don't serve those nasty looking red hot dogs. My brother had wings and fries, the wings did look good as well, cooked to golden brown perfection. As far as tacos, I tried, chipotle chicken, grilled chicken, steak, and pulled pork. I enjoyed the grilled chicken and steak the best. Tacos are $1.00 on Tuesday. I also ordered a side of rice and beans. While I thought the serving was small, I enjoyed the rice because there are veggies in it. For the 6 tacos I had (they're small) I actually had just enough to finish off while eating my tacos. I look forward to coming back to trying something off the regular menu before I say I have found a new spot to frequent. Typically I get a chicken dish with rice and beans or fajitas. I also enjoyed my drink it was a margarita with a carona added. I'll give that two thumbs up. Not sure on the rating so I'll give it average right now.
