lym9VHmU2QupopVsMGt7lg This is actually one of my favorite places to grab a quick bite. I've gone to Chipotle from Boston to California - very basic, uniform menu. The 1 star is for this location specifically. 
I don't know if this is just a management issue but you're not reinventing the wheel. 
If your staff hate their jobs - get out of customer service. You never know just how nasty the help is - until they're pounding the rice spoon so hard it's cutting through the tortilla, just quit! That's a pain in the rear for the customer to eat that burrito. In fact I'm going to skip this location all together. There's so many alternative eating options.
