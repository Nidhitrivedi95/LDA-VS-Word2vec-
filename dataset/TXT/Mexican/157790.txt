knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw Pretty sub-average food. Actually, I've had much better Mexican food in airports. Wife's quesadilla was extremely lame, filled with nothing. We didn't want to pay for it since she didn't eat it. Manager came over all huffy and seemed annoyed, almost arguing with us saying "Well, that's our quesidilla." To which I replied, "Well, it's lame and I'm not paying for it, take it back please." Honestly, for $2 less I could get a really good one at Chipotle that is thick and filled with stuff.

On a bright note our young server girl was very nice and apologetic. I see NO reason to ever go back to this place. Ok, maybe just for margarita's on the patio on E. 4th. Avoid for food but maybe just go for chips and drinks.
