a8pmtlVKf7NiSLI-4KejIw El Catrin was very accommodating. We had a 6:30 reservation for two, ending up being 15 minutes late. We only had to wait 3 minutes before being seated. Beats waiting in line 45 minutes. Word of advice, make a reservation before heading to El Catrin. Its easy to do online on their website.Tables are snug, so you might make friends with the table next to you. 

The food is Mexican tapas style and is on the pricier side. Ordered some guac to begin with, a corn dish (Equistes) that was really good and flavorful, two sets of fish tacos and of course the churros. All were fantastic. Fish tacos were really good, but I have to admit, I have had better back in Ottawa.

The beginning of the service was a tad slower as we placed our drink order (two waters and a soda) and it took quite some time for them to arrive. ( I was parched and hung over, so I was anxiously awaiting a big cold glass of water). Other than that, all was good!

This is a place where a lot of people go to of ages to have fun, let loose and enjoy some good Mexican food.

I would recommend this restaurant.
