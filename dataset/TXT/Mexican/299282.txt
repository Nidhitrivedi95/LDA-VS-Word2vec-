ZkUWOdBA4T7pdUhT0dkRzQ As I predicted, another friend dragged me here yesterday for lunch. We got there at 1:05 pm, and got seated immediately.

It took over 10 minutes for someone to greet us and take out drink orders, but I could see they were at the end of their lunch rush, so give them a few minutes to check everyone else out and get back on track, right? No, the bad service continued even when the restaurant had a total of 3 occupied tables.

Needless to say, our drinks took way more time than they should have. Our table side guacamole was bland. My tacos did not come with the toppings listed on the menu. Our plates sat and sat. We had to ask for our server so we could pay and get the heck out of there...with our plates, bowls, glasses still sitting in front of us.

YIKES, will not recommend to anyone.
