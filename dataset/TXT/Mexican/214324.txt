QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA It was Late and I was a little buzzed but the nachos were GREAT. .. Has several different types and both were supper Good. 
Service was fast and friendly but not alot of people there so not sure how they do when it's packed.
Next time I'm in town will definitely eat there again..
