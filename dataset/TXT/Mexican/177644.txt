mswelTP1cQiuAps2fSGuBw WTF DO THEY PUT IN THESE BURGERS!!!???? The first time I had a burger from here is when I stayed in perris  ( lake perris california ) and it was remarkable. So today me and my wife ate at the eastern blvd location right across from walmart by the airport. Let me tell you this besides the long line in the drive thru. It was well worth the wait. The lady at the window was very polite and curious. If you haven't tried this place you should. It's a amazing hamburger spot. They also have pancakes. Well uhhhh don't know how I feel about a hamburger joint serving pancakes lol. But wait mickey dees serve right?? Idk but any who. Great burgers for a reasonable price. Try it and let me know how it turns out.
