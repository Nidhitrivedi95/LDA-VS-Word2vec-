1x8_aJQ-iqvymhRK3SNbLg Restaurant was about half full, but it took a while to be greeted and have a drink order taken. Ten minutes went by before a manager checked on my boyfriend & I because he noticed we had been sitting, drinkless, for a bit. He brought us waters and went to hover around the bartender. A short while later the drinks came out. The waitress came back to take our order, super apologetic, and offered us a free dessert at the end of the meal. 

We ordered queso as an appetizer and one of each kind of taco for Taco Tuesday ($1.50 each).  The queso never arrived at the table, so we just moved onto the tacos. None of the five protein choices stood out in particular. Not impressed by the food.

The margaritas were expensive, around $15 bucks, and they didn't really seem to even be the right color for what we had ordered. They tasted super sugary and not like a "top shelf" drink. 

Won't be back... on to the next Taco Tuesday adventure.
