TRRmgX8mySv_y-DOkTZTFQ Once again I'm confused by the validity of the 4 and 5 star reviews for this place. 
I had madero cantina bookmarked,as the description  of some of their dishes sounded promising that I may have stumbled upon  legitimate and potentially authentic Hispanic food. 

So we came here for my birthday with high hopes. But instead we left disappointed and $60 was totally squandered on bland white washed, rust belt style Mexican food. 

1.)We started out with one of their insanely overpriced margaritas which was just a silly choice and waste of money from the start (they range in price from$ 11-18) and are not worth even $3.

2.) Opted for the trio of queso, salsa and guacamole ..because of course the authentic corn and mushroom based huitlacoche "dip" we wanted was removed from the menu. I'm guessing because no one around here knew what it was or what to make of it because many pittsburghers just aren't that cultured, therefore it probably never got ordered.

3.) Main course was the enchiladas. They were the absolute most ridiculous excuse for enchiladas I have ever encountered. It would be like if Denny's or eat n park suddenly decided to make enchiladas one of their offerings and had one of their high school drop out cooks attempt to prepare Mexican food for the 1st time, with no prior knowledge of Mexican food or spices. 

4.) Lastly the temperature. Every last bite of food was barely warm, bordering on cold. At this point I would not have been surprised if the margarita was served warm, everything was just that off.
No spice, no heat, no hot sauces on the table, and none in plain sight at other tables. 
They only thing I had that was even remotely edible was the Rajas con crema. 
The search for palatable Mexican food continues.
Sorry Madero Cantina ; la comida no es nada bueno
