WGFJbxzhO44Ku05BM1hDjA My family has been eating here off and on for a couple of years. Every visit is different. Many times we have terrible service--long wait to get order taken and do not get drinks refilled until the meal is almost finished. I do not recommend eating here if you are in a hurry! However, the food is pretty good. Again, not the most consistent, but it is never terrible. Prices are above average for Mexican cuisine and the food isn't any better than the less expensive competition. We eat here because it is close to home, but when time permits, we drive across town to a faster, less expensive favorite. If you just want to sit and enjoy some chips, fresh salsa, cheese dip, fresh guacamole, margaritas, and good company with no time restraints, this is a great place.
