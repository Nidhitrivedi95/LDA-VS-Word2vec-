fzQeUR_AvjpwIWjsMDAbGw I've been having hankerings for Mexican for the last year after touring a few cities in the US for work and having great Mexican options while down there.

I've never known Toronto to have many Mexican options so I've been hard pressed to fulfil my cravings.

It's unfortunate that I have to report that Fat Bastards was quite a letdown. Burritos and other 
"standard" Mexican fair are not difficult dishes to get right but somehow Fat Bastards produced really below par food. It's been quite a while since I've been as disappointed in a meal as I was the one time I tried this place a few months ago. 

Spare yourself the letdown and find another option.
