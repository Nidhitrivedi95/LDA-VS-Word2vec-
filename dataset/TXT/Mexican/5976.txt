_EVOLAjWYEfSOO_smbBxaA As Chipotle is a chain, I have to rate it based on other Chipotles.  This location is new, so it is nice and clean.  The food was good as always.  The service was extremely slow.  Chipotles are known for getting large numbers of people through  at busy lunch times...I would hate to see this place at a rush.  There was barely anyone there when we went and both my wife and I commented on how slow this place was for a Chipotle.  The location is convenient in the Wexford area.
