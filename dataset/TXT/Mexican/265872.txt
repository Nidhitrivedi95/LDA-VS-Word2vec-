wDfz8ap9xWzj46mtNDcT9A Giving 5 stars cause one can easily eat for 8-12 dollars here and be full. I get chimichangas with the beef tips almost every time I go. The beef is always cooked to perfection: a little bite and firmness, then falls apart in slow-cooked strings in the mouth. The chimichanga is always golden brown and not oily at all. Classic white cheese sauce on top,and flavorful beans and "guacamole salad" on the side.  Arroz Con Pollo and Chicken soup are very flavorful and satisfying as well. Green chile chicken is delicious too.Nice gravel parking lot, scenic views of 85 and the Tuckaseegee/Little Rock intersection. What more could you ask for?
