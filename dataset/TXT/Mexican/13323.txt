0jAexNHRHhkQv4zNYqenBA Bartenders are awesome. However, the manager is laxadaisical amd worthless. You could clearly see how he was influencing the servers to do less and ignore their customers.  Friday night manager needs to go if they want to maintain a busy bar. And the worst part cockroaches in the ice and the bartender continued to use the bug ridden ice. How gross!! Thankfully i was drinking bottled beer
