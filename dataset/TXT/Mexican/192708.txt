OMEbwr0Aybw_wnqvno-6zQ Stopped here on a whim and so glad we did! We were driving down the road actually going somewhere else for dinner and the sign caught my eye. For some reason switched plans on the fly!

This was our first time at a Chuy's and our waiter did a great job giving us a rundown of the menu. He brought out our chips with salsa and a thing of Jalapeño crime sauce... wow. So good. I ordered the a huge steak burrito that was very very good. The amount of food was insane and I simply could not finish it.

Prices are about what you would expect and just an overall good first experience, no doubt in my mind we will return at some point.
