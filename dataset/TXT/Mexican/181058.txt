ncqOM1DgAq2mQ4zY9Za0Mg Comparing to other burrito boyz this one falls short. The staff is very slow, walked in when it was empty and it took a while to place the order and even longer to choose the toppings. The amount of toppings you get is very very little. At other locations the burrito is overflowing with toppings, at this one there was barely anything on it. I literately got 6 black beans on the whole burrito. Located close to my house but I'd rather drive down the street to the dundas location.
