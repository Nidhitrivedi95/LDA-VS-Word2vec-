e13SEvJud_vgeDR_doL4sQ Food was very disappointing. We ordered the ribeye tacos which was their special of the day. Waitress advised against ordering the lobster tacos. Service was okay but the food was really blah.  The beans were salty, the rice was dry and the tacos were salty and unmemorable.  I wouldn't come back a second time.
