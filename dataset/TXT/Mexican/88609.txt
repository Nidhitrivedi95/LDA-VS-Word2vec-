dNDAdeE8olF4eZaslNtBZw Terrible food. What ever you do don't order albondigas soup.  It was a bowl full of greasy unstrained beef with one measly piece of carrot and celery and three small meatballs of mystery meat. Corn tortillas were greasy. Won't be returning to this place.  Kudos to wait staff, they were attentive.
