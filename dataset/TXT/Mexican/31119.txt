4ggOHxvlxnF0a00hDDVbnQ Exceptional wings, some if the best I ever had. They are smoked and not deep fried. I've been told the Chipotle Ranch sauce is purchased and not made, not sure how this is possible as some days it's more on the Chipotle side and others it is straight ranch with a slight hint of Chipotle. Would give 4 stars if the Chipotle wasn't always hit or miss and would give 5 star if the "wing special" didn't just go up almost double and isn't a deal anymore as they are wingdings and not full wings. I'll stick to places that offer full wings for 10 cents more in the area....
