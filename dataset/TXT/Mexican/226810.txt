S_bG5WWbtNXhhY9Y0GTcSg Transformed previous coffee shop into a clean modern great place to eat sip and visit with friends. Attention by a expert staff to customers flows into the kitchen that uses great fresh ingredients. Am going through the breakfast menu and have yet to be disappointed! The croque madame is best outside of Paris! Heading into lunch menu next. Don't miss and BTW best scones sine Kohnie's on Cameback.
