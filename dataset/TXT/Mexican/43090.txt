7D-ATDP9Ezr1ZehszsotOQ Our family has been going to Nuevo Acapulco for as long as we can remember. We usually go there about once a week...tonight was a disaster. We arrived  at 6:15 pm, we were seated at 6:45 when hostess said it would be a 10 to 15 minute wait and then she seated another 4 person party before us, we were a four person party plus a baby. 

We were seated afterwards 45 min. We ordered and after an hour and a half of waiting and not being served four regular meals we left, they served many people around us but said rice wasn't available and why they couldn't serve our food after an hour and a half. We told the waiter and the manager and they could not care less. They served another family of five that had been seated 30 minutes behind us with a full meal by the time we left. We and our WHOLE extended family will never be back.
