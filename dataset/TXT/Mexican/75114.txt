cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A We stopped here for our usual DDD find while in town for a soccer tournament. Ummmm not sure how this place has such great ratings, maybe it was what we got but it was not good. Sorry. I got the red chicken and fried rice The chicken wasn't bad but the rice was awful -- so sticky and gloppy. My daughter got a quesadilla which had way too much Rosemary (or that is what it tasted like) -- it made the food taste like medicine. My husband got a combo plate with a bunch of stuff (I'm not sure what all he got) with a jerk chicken quesadilla (I know he got this because I tasted it), and again too much of a seasoning making it taste like medicine. None of us finished our food. The best part of the meal was the cookie....
