iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg We were in Kensington on Sunday and the restaurant/fast food location was lined up out the door and the line never got smaller because people just kept coming for the tacos.

We were down in Kensington Wednesay and it was lunchtime so we dicided to try it. The line up was crazy and the wait to order was about 15 minutes, then about 10 minutes to get the food. Well worth the wait.

I had the Gonernador and my husband had the blackend mahi mahi. Both were outstanding. Jam packed with food and if you want extra spice, there are pots on the front counter.
$5.00 each. What an inexpensive lunch for two.

We will definately go back to this take out restaurant.
