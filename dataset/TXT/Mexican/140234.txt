J7KlrDFrriWoRkIUVNRPbg After a debacle at the Venetian we headed to the MGM location to redeem my bfs groupon he was beyond annoyed that we had to go travel from the Venetian to the MGM for his margarita. The ladies at this location were extra nice when we explained what happened at the Venetian. In the end the margarita had no alcohol so the bf was disappointed. Not worth the headache just skip the groupon. But the service was great.
