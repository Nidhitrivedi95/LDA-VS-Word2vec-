eem6eoAiYL9UcQUE0kMD-g I can't believe I found this place after I moved to the east coast:(. This is exactly what I was looking for: affordable, simple, standard Mexican breakfast options including chorizo plates and burritos, huevos rancheros, and great American breakfast deals. The tortillas were great! I loved the salsa. They also have horchata and piña that looked yummy. I'll have to come by next time I'm in town!
