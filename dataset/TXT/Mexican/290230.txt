Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Definitely a pretty setup. The restaurant was a little fancier than I thought it would be for lunch. Service was a little slow, but I had gotten use to this by now in Vegas.  I feel like I'm always begging to get my water filled at half these restaurants.
As far as the food, the bread they bought out in the little pans was adorable and very very tasty (and carbs were much needed at this point).  I had the scallops for my main course. They were good but a tiny portion. Just know that if you are going to get them you likely want to get an app too.
