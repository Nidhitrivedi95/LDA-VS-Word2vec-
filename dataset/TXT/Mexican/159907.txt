KwufI-XUy8Vs2cnJ8n7F6w I've been to several Pollo Locos in California and they were always good, so I was looking forward to going this new location close to home.  But this one is a "Pollo No-go." 

Got carry out for the family and they made three different errors in in making the order.   (missing dressing for the salad; added shrimp- that we cannot eat; wrong beans).   Plus the chicken was too dry.   You simply can't afford to mess up the chicken when 'pollo' is the name of the restaurant!

I called to complain about the mistakes with the order.   The guy on the phone gave me his employee number and said that he would "take care of" me next time I come in.   What does that mean?  Shouldn't they take care of every customer?   I'm not too eager to go back. 
I filled out an on line survey that asks if you want to be contacted.  I said Yes, but haven't heard back. 

Even though this is a new location, their management seems to not care or are just too disorganized to function well.
