6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA Good service. Good food. Sticky floors. The chips for the table came hot and were delicious. Our waitress (who also sat us) was very courteous and attentive, checking in on us regularly throughout our meal. The food was good. They had decent Mexican cuisine; everything was seasoned well and there was a small, but broad selection of menu items to choose from. The kids menus also featured chicken fingers, cheeseburgers, and Mac n cheese in case you have picky eaters like me. The only down side was that the floors were definitely not clean. My shoes kept sticking to the flooring as I walked, like someone spilled a soft drink and it wasn't cleaned properly.
