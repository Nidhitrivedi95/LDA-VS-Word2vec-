WCOuyKKNHWqua5MAKUNpaQ Im just going to list the bad things. 

1) When you are across the shopping center from a Safeway, don't tell me you've run out of oranges. 

2) Don't put lardy refried pinto beans in a fish taco. It dulls the flavor and makes the plate heavy and terrible. 

3) When chicken is listed as "de-boned", do not give us a drumstick. That's just stupid and offensive. Also, "heavily salted" does not equal "spices".

4) How can you run out of flan, then charge us for it and forget to take it off the bill?

5) Food poisoning is not awesome. 

This place is terrible. Their prices are ridiculous, but I assume that since they are up the road from places like Flemmings, they think they can get away with it. Their design motif is also terrible. 

I'll give you advice.  Shut this place down, re-open as a bar with your dance floor you tried to pass off as a dining room.
