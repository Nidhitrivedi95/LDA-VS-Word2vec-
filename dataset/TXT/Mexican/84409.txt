d8Kz48UDfZ0MPuQpGy2r0Q I had the pleasure of stopping by this as part of a wine tasting event and was thoroughly impressed. The location is amazing, phenomenal views, good service and good food. I had the trout salad and it was done absolutely perfectly. I rarely order fish when dining out because they never make it as well as I do, but this was an exception. It was delicious, tender and tasty. It is pricey and there wine prices are high, so beware.
