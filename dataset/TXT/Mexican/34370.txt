Farmers insurance to the far left, a Dairy Queen slightly closer, and a gas station on the corner, Sin Fronteras Tacos can do little to stand out. Without curb appeal, clientele, I was informed, relied purely on word of mouth.

"3 weeks", he said in response to my question. He'd been open a fairly short time, and it turns out ownership lies in threes. The trio all share a mutual history in food, each working in different restaurants. Though the choice of locale is curious, their combined experience from working in major Strip properties tips the scales in their favour.

Once entering, there is a noticeable cloud of smoke which will permeate through clothing if dining in. Seating is fairly slim due to a lack of tables though this may change since SFT is still in it's infancy. It apparent there was a goal of visual modernity which makes the worn orange tile-work from owners past look out of place, especially when compared to the stone counter top.

After ordering carne fries, and nachos sans meat; what came was a wet burrito instead of the fries. A shrug and a "food is food" mentality ensured the burrito was there to stay. The outer layer was crisped to prevent sogginess, which was much appreciated, with the interior stuffed with rice, salsa, cilantro, and surprisingly, not a single piece of fatty cuts whatsoever. The topping was a too heavy in taste, however,. Side note: cilantro lime rice as an alternative would have been fantastic. The nachos were topped perfectly, though lacked layers, and left an awkward bed of virgin chips underneath.

Would recommend. Maybe I'll get the fries next time.
