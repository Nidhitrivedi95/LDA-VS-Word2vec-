Qk36E2wRexicmtcUrEyWsQ Awesome, awesome, awesome! I have been coming here for years and it just gets better. Had #12 with enchiladas smothered in their delicious green sauce. Nothing better! The chips and salsa are the best in town, bar none. If you love good Mexican food like I do, drop everything and head to Los Compadres!
