v0ubf7h2E0OfwGGfkI1S4w Que Onda was impressive. I've been to the uptown location and wasn't that satisfied. This location is 2 minutes from home so we have it a second chance. It was way better. Ordered the combination fajitas chicken and shrimp. The only thing I would say is they should remove the tails from the shrimp so I wouldn't have to do it at the table myself. The three amigos app is on point. The veggie tacos were an excellent light dish. Should definitely add crunchy taco shells to the menu for the gluten free customer. Great service. Will be back. - Vernon
