r8Jr-7YfkhJL2nxk9lxUNg I would return here exclusively to just have the empanadas again! These were outstanding. Perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They came with a delicious house made dipping sauce. I tried the mango margarita. It came frozen and it had a very nice, fresh flavor. I do think that they went a little light on the tequila. The fresh made chips and salsa was also delicious. But definitely try the empanadas!
