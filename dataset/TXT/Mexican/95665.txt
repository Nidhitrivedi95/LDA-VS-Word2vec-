EHDcxAlrrP4VPiZuQlrIrg We returned after a previous bad experience here. The management tried to correct the issues but is limited by their policies, they are evidently unable to do more then verbally admonish poor employees. The bartender made it clear he knew we had complained. He was unfriendly, unprofessional, and he  made our entire experience as uncomfortable as possible and we will not be returning. Plus, the bar was still filthy. You win.
