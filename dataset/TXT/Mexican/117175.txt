gOBxVkHpqtjRRxHBIrpnMA I finally paid a visit to Chipotle and well what can i say that already hasn't been said about this place? Not much. But here it goes anyways. 

The barbacoa burrito I had was good. Not blow my mind amazing, but very good. It was wrapped well, and I didn't have the problem of it falling apart as I ate it. My number one gripe is that the "hot" salsa isn't really hot at all. Much Tabasco was needed to make this burrito the level of spicy that I craved. Also you gotta pay extra for guac, which is just silly. Because how can you conceive a burrito without guac? 

There was just the right amounts of each ingredients in my burrito, and I didn't find any ingredient overpowering the other. 

The service was fast and the assembly stations are kept super clean, which is a big plus for me. Also I can have a beer with my burrito here, so that in itself makes me like this place even more. All in all, good Cali style burrito.
