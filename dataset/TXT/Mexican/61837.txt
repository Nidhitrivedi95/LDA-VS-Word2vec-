AUl6myFhTAbEqt0GMdKHiw One of our favorite places and locations. Have never gotten sick and this location is fast even when crazy busy like during booritto halloweens. Fast and friendly, most times (4/5), selections/food choices are always kept up and ready to go. 

Sad that chorizo meat has ended. Meats have become slightly spicier so daughter won't eat the meats anymore . Add queso (2017) is delicious.
