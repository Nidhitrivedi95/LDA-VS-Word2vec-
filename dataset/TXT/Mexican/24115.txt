2Sn5VxuA4-TTUbbshZ5kDg When I found the first short, curly hair in my burrito bowl, I thought it was just a small mistake. When I found the second hair, however, I figured it was time to make a complaint. The two hairs--in the one burrito bowl--were also clearly from the heads [let's hope heads] of two individuals, so this might just be a general problem at this location.

I'm sure lots of other Chipotle restaurants are fine--this one just needs some work.
