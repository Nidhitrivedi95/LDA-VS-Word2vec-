AFH56n1hVLIHQtr5BvezTQ My boyfriend absolutely loves this place. He gets a breakfast burrito all the time so I figured I'd try it out for "Taco Tuesday". I got two chicken tacos with a side of rice and beans. It was just EH for me. Maybe my expectations were too high but I didn't think it was all that.
