n6u8lDrWBYkis8EQTwgOyA The Enchilada sauce was so good it must be homemade like everything else.
The chef was very observant of all that was going on, maybe the owner? Lots of couples and families eating. Glad we drove over to check it out before the movies accross the street. Wish they had Chili Rellenos and Huevos Rancheros. They had a burrito chicken  Caesar sounded interesting.
Its not fast food! So get that out of your head. Stylish plates and silverware combined with nice paper napkins makes it nice yet casual. 
At first your suprised by the prices UNTIL YOU put the first bite in your mouth!  This food is made by a chef.
