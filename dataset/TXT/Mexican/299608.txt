ZkUWOdBA4T7pdUhT0dkRzQ Very disappointed as it seems BQ has gone downhill. Went for taco Tuesday. Ordered tacos, beans and elote "cocktail." The saddest part was the tacos. Had shrimp taco that arrived with fish in it. Sent it back and when it came back there was ONE shrimp in it. Lots of cabbage, very skimpy on the good stuff.
elote was about a cup of corn drizzled with sauce. Not sure how this is an appetizer. It is enough for one person at most. Beans were cold, crusty and dry.
this place used to be good. The only positive was the service, which was friendly. Not sure we'll ever be back. Even the chips were cold and stale. Major disappointment.
