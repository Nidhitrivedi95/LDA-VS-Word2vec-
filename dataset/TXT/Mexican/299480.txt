ZkUWOdBA4T7pdUhT0dkRzQ Good food, service, & atmosphere. We went there for "Restaurant Week" and the menu included a margarita, appetizer, main corse, & dessert all for $33/person. The signature pork (Cochinita Pibil) was excellent as usual, tried the chile relleno with vegetables and it was a little watery & needed some spice, flan was ok but the dessert churro was awesome. 2nd time we've been there and have yet to get table side guacamole made every one else got it but us (again).
