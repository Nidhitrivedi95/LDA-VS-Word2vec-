If I don't have experiences where my taco meat was overcooked and dried occasionally or under seasoned it would be better. Maybe the cook should be thought about calculating residual heat into cook times and proper seasoning? The cashiers are often unprofessional, with the younger kid being a really depressing presence consistently, but they are nice. The biggest complaint I have is when I order tacos and there aren't toppings at all. Also the avocado tasted like egg one-time for the avocado salad, as a cook I know it's hard but you have to keep track of avocados and how ripe and what color they are inside and outside. All in all I know it's still a new spot and I always come back so good job for the good things.
