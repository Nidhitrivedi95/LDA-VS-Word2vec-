EHDcxAlrrP4VPiZuQlrIrg This place was not even that busy. We sat there for 25 minutes and they couldn't even take our drink order. I tried to get a manager, and all I got was rude responses from the employees. If I remember correctly from previous visits, the food wasn't that good anyway. Adios Cabo! You and your lousy staff won't see anymore of my money.
