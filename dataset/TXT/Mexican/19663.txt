1x8_aJQ-iqvymhRK3SNbLg The service here was completely awful. We waited nearly 15 minutes before we were even greeted by a waitress and then another 10 minutes before we got waters. Once they did finally take our order, the food was extremely mediocre. Our waitress was also rude and seemed distracted. The staff was not very attentive to anyone aside from the people at the bar. Needless to say, we will not be returning.
