6ockUmdOBYBApEsUCJkBzA Picture this: you're in a quaint room filled with chairs in vivid colors. Two children sit at a miniature picnic table, speaking to each other over popsicles as their parents eat ice cream. You sit in one of the colorful chairs, scraping a plastic spoon over the cold exterior of ice cream--an ice cream scoop that you come to discover, as you bring the spoon to your mouth, is the best ice cream you have ever had. 

This was my experience at El Oasis. I chose the mango ice cream, which surprisingly had mango chunks in it as well. The environment felt like an eternal summer day, as if it didn't matter what time of year it was--no matter what, El Oasis will be a sunny place where ice cream will always be the perfect choice, regardless of the weather outside. 

At the ice cream counter, there are two options: water based and dairy based. There are plenty of flavors for each; the main difference is that the water based ice cream has a refreshing, sherbert-like texture, whereas the diary based is creamy and decadent. The cost of one scoop may seem slightly expensive upon first impression, but one scoop fills a cup and you can't beat the quality.

I highly recommend El Oasis. If you're looking for something new and can picture yourself in the scene described above, this is an excellent place to go.
