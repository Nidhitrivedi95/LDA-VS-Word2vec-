fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg Ate here twice over the weekend and would have eaten there again if I had more time. The first day we tried the trash can nachos and margaritas, and they were so delicious! The second time we just stopped in for dessert, we had the churro and it was huge! Definitely large portions here and 2 people can share a plate. On top of that the staff is very friendly and helpful. The restaurant is clean and I loved the style of it. We will definitely be back next time we're in Vegas.
