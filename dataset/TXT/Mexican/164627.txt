lLindjep86GA3PeKMl55Og Ordered the 1/2lb bacon western burger supposed to be piled high with applewood bacon all I got were 2 paper thin pieces of "bacon" 2 tiny onion rings and a burger that was larger than the spongy bun that is supposed to be baked fresh. Very disappointed for what I spent for this burger.
