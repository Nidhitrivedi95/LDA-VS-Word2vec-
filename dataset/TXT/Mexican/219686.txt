rfmXVYoFnxRUPvOqPMkiLg I'm tough on Mexican food outside of El Paso. I'll be the first to say that it's tough to sway me away from what I believe is great Mexican food since I grew up in an area some would consider a mecca for it. Visiting Arizona led us on a wild goose chase for breakfast and, after failing to find the bagel shop, we stopped here. It definitely had vibes of california Mexican food so I went with a surf n turf burrito (wet: with enchilada sauce & cheese) and my lady got the breakfast torta. Both were decent plates. The enchilada sauce was too salty and kind of took away from the surf n turf. That's my mistake. The torta was fairly bland and felt more like home food (not in a great way).  I was upset about this place and a major turnoff was seeing the woman who worked there eating the chips while making our food. The serving size was huge but it didn't make up for the lackluster taste. Also, as we drove out of the parking lot...we noticed the bagel shop right next door in the shopping center beside it. Definitely trying the bagels next time.
