I normally will not drink tequila because it tastes like gasoline to me. He challenged me to try one of his margaritas and if I didn't like it he would take it away and get something else. I didn't even think about sending the drink back. When I asked what was in it I was impressed. It wasn't the normal mix or standard alcohols put together.  They go above and beyond. He really knows his mixology and you can tell it's a passion of his. The chili verde was an explosion of flavor meat perfectly tender. The salsa was five stars. Lots of flavor with a kick. They have different kinds to try. Check this place out you will not be let down.
