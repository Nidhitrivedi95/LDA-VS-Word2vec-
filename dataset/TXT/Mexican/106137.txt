Waiter could not describe the fish in any way(it's like a fish finger in a taco). Sloppy and thoughtless. No quality check on anything.  Hostess made stink eye when we brought her attention to the above making a possibly forgivable bad experience unforgivable. Too bad. We are servers and usually generous and forgiving.
