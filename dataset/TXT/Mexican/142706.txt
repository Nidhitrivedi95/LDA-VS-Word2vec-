JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg I hardly have words to describe the amazing experience we had at El Dorado last night. I read great things on Yelp before coming, so the location next to the strip club was not surprising. And I definitely agree with the reviews that state that patrons should not be deterred by location. 

We had a 9:00 pm dinner reservation and we arrived a little early. Our table was not yet ready so the hostess escorted us to the bar. The bartender was really helpful in suggesting drinks, especially when the one I contained items that were out of stock. Some people mentioned that the drinks were expensive, each is around $12, but being from DC this feels pretty routine for me, and in Vegas the price is fair. 

We were seated promptly after receiving our drinks. We had a nice booth in the main dining room. Our server was so nice and very on top of all of his tables. We ordered the table side guac as an appetizer. I highly recommend it. I am a huge fan of Mexican food and I always order table side guac, and this was the best one I have had to date! I ordered the street tacos (1 pulled chicken and 2 carne asada) and they were amazing. Initially the portion size seemed small but I definitely walked away feeling full! Rice is an extra charge with the meal, but totally worth it. 

The service was great, the food was great and the drinks were delicious. I highly recommend this place. It is hands down the best Mexican I have ever had!
