C3d4HqDjWq9e_0cPfmPykg Well I finally gave Moe's a shot, and I was really disappointed. First off, I loved the menu names and the TV show/movie references they made, but they didn't include any descriptions. Is there something I'm missing here? 
Anyways, when I got to the counter I ordered a burrito and built it to my liking and found somewhere to sit. 
Once I sat down I immediately noticed that the table smelled foul. The area smelled mildewy and really ruined the meal before it even started.
The burrito itself was just not very good. Somehow it wasn't particularly warm, and it was lacking flavor despite the various ingredients and sauces I put on it. I did enjoy that the meal came with chips and there was a salsa bar available.
Overall, I was sadly underwhelmed. I may have came on an off day, but Moe's failed to live up to the hype. I'm all for second chances, but it won't come anytime soon for Moe's.
