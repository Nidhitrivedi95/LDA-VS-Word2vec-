Honestly, 0 stars from me.. 
I came here for a friend's birthday where the table was already set with fresh chips and salsa. Great start until we were actually ready to order and there was not a waitress in sight. Mind, our dinner started at 7 pm and we did not receive our dinner until 8:30 pm.. we ate nothing but chips the whole hour and half so by the time the food came we were stuffed. My friend ordered a shrimp quesadilla and was given MY chicken quesadilla which they took back after she took one bite and realized it wasn't what she ordered. This happened to another friend who was also apart of the party but it was exactly what she ordered and the waitress continued to just take it away from her. By the time the shrimp and chicken quesadillas came out they were soggy and again we were not hungry at the time. My meal totaled $19.00 and that is counting a $7.00 queso which I've never had to spend that much at a Mexican restaurant before... especially for a quesadilla and queso. And for a tablespoon of guacamole was an EXTRA $2.00. 
Never again!
Oh yeah.. and we saw one of the waiters kicking and stepping on roaches right by our table in the kitchen...
You're welcome
