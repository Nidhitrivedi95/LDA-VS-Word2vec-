dWShECwk4R1cQhzOzJXtIQ I've been to Los arcos enough to give it a fair review. Been coming for a few years now and the servers know me by name. This an Americanized version of a Mexican restaurant and most of the plates come with, as you probably guessed, rice and beans. The menu is very extensive covering everything from burritos, to tacos, enchildas, tamales and so on. The chili replenish are great! I have a personal liking to the platters.  The combination plates generally run about 10-12 bucks and you can mix and match. I like the  The pitcher of margaritas is generally a good deal as you can get about 4 margaritas out of a pitcher. The salsa is very good. There is plenty of parking and usually there is not much of a wait for a table. Service is usually good to about average with employees and friends of employees getting most of the attention. Dinners do come out pretty fast. As a bonus, this is one of the better Mexican places in the area.
