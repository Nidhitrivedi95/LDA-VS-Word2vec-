a9aW5e731lplWGHUZ02-zQ Oh Chino Locos (from here on = CL) .... my good friend lived literally next to it and I was ready to move in just to make these sweet dudes my neighbours. It's very small inside - I don't think I have ever seen anyone eating INSIDE, just waiting on their burrito. 

The most amazing thing about CL  is that they can put noodles in the burritos instead of rice...I don't know what genius thought of this idea but HAIL ALL THINGS NOODLE. It's delightful, fun and different.

My favorite choice here is the fish - it's marinaded in special sauce (I don't care what the secret recipe is, just gimmi gimmi moaarrr) and it's always fresh. 

I always got mild because the spicy was HELLA spicy and I just cannot afford another burn-hole in my stomach. If you enjoy a kick - this is the flavour for you, dear friend.

The staff here is great, they're talkative, funny, sweet and very helpful. The prices are great, never paid more than $7 for a burrito and it's always loaded (I don't ask for extras). 

GO HERE!!! If you're ever strolling around the beaches area and happen to get hungry, take a walk to Greenwood and submerge yourself  into the wonderful world of Chino Locos.... 

Livin el Chino Loco xoxo
