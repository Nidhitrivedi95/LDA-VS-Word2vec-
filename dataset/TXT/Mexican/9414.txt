_WtxQbDK7B-ExGdeG-2j6Q I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. I've eaten here several times a week for the last 10+ years and have immensely enjoyed every single meal. Yesterday, for the first time, I had the prime rib and it was absolutely heavenly. The best prime rib I've ever experienced in any restaurant anywhere. Fantastic!
