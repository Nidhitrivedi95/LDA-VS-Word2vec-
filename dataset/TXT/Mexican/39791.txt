6lCFq6RQxctSW37yNYZ5wg We were stuck at this hotel without a rental car, so we decided to try it. No real designated eating area here, so you have to sit around a bar. The microscopic portions of food that they serve are bland AND, as a bonus, overpriced! Do yourself a flavor ( pun intended) and walk a short distance down the street to Chipotle rather than dining here or at the hotel's other dismal failure of a restaurant.
