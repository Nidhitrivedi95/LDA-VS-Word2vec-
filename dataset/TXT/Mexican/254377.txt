v7xjDbezQ2xw95itvN244Q This joint is close to work HQ and surprised I didn't come here sooner.  It's a great authentic Mexican restaurant known for their mariscos.  Still, I find it awkward to elaborate about places that are from different cultures.  I find it hard to refrain from rolling my eyes and SMH when heads provide their rendition of their review of other cultures without knowing the real deal, so if I become a hypocrite in this review, feel free to call me out on it...lol.
  
After a long trek through the Broad Acres Swap Meet in North Las Vegas, we figured we may as well keep it real and conclude the adventure with some good Mexican grub.  Our menu consisted of white fish ceviche de oescado, carne zarandeade, pulpitos a la mantequilla, botana mixta, cerveza preparada and horchata, all of which made me excited and added to the suspense.  

I was told that there is a live mariachi band, but none in sight when we arrived.  It can get pretty sporty and didn't know how I felt about not hearing myself chew today, so okay with the blasting Mexican music.  But I spoke too soon, in came the band and jammed at a table till we departed.  Soon afterward a dude came by suited and booted selling chocolate bars followed by a guy slangin rosaries.

The place is pretty authentic in my book.  Sometimes I feel that the great finds not always have the highest Yelp review, but less in this case and is a diamond in the rough.  The michiladas were on point and splashed with fish juice even, now if that ain't authentic, I dint know what is.  

I have to give the overall experience a 4 since its just what the doctor ordered...a great day at the Mexican swap meet followed by some good Mexican food.  I hope that my follow up visits will be just as entertaining.  Next time, I plan to have the pescado zarandeade and will provide you all with the scoops on that.
