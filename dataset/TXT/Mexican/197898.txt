p-w6g8cuQq5PU_4U1XNCzQ We have enjoyed this restaurant in the past but after tonight we will not be going back. We were seated quickly and ordered. We waited and waited and waited. Two other couples who were seated 10 to 15 minutes after we were seated got their food. We asked twice about what was taking so long for fish tacos and cheese enchiladas. After another few minutes with no response other than"sorry," we left and had a nice dinner elsewhere.  This restaurant is permanently off our list.
