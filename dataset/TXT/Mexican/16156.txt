1CSMpBHr3mYd9XEOldM2yw I usually like this location a lot. They recently reorganized and the company was purchased. Since then, I noticed the prices increased on F and Easy brands, particularly the to go foods and pre made meals. I also went one day and they were missing a lot of items. I'm glad that it's convenient and there are some items I really like but overall, I have stopped going here as frequently because of the price increase. The friends rewards card is great and I like the $5 off I get.
