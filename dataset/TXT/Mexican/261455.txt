VUEbOHYJYcnmjfsnxCitiQ These little hole-in-the-wall places are very easy to by-pass when looking for a nice place to eat.  If you skip over places like this, you can often miss out on some good food, so after passing by this place over the past several weeks, I ventured inside.

I decided to go with the tacos banderos or aka their version of fish tacos made with marlin and a serrano pepper, onion, and tomato salsa.  The meal comes with 4 tacos, though these are smaller versions of their larger cousins.  You get to choose 2 sides from rice, salad, or re-fried beans.  The tacos were supposed to be served with 3 sauces, but I only got 2.  

I'm not sure the fish tacos rate 4 stars, but I think they were better than 3 stars, so I'm giving them the higher of the 2 ratings.
