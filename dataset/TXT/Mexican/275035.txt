xceERetY6Q9Pu_BQ32xpeA I find it funny that I've been to Phoenix about 9u79q87909qut09qw8r09 times yet every time has been only in some portion of this airport /airport tram. Anyway...

I ate here at El Bravo on March 29, 2010. It was around 8 ish o'clock and let's face it, there's not a ton of places to chose from to eat when you're waiting on your flight to board. I had a 2 hour layover and I didn't want Chinese or Wendy's so this was my only choice. I was so hungry as I had a slice of sausage and a glass of water only that day. 

It ticked me off that while Wendy's and the Chinese restaurant share a fountain machine to get drinks out of, yet when I asked for a cup of tap water here, free at EVERY restaurant pretty much, I was told I had to buy an overpriced bottle of water - they don't share the water spout of the fountain machine with the two other restaurants. Grrr. I wish I would have just asked for a cup and went to the water fountain next to the bathrooms since I can suck down a bottle of water in 3 or 4 gulps. I'm a water feign. 

The tortilla soup wasn't much of a soup, it was more the consistency of of paste or oatmeal. If it was any thicker, you may be able to eat it with a fork. Luckily, it had a really nice flavor and was not loaded with cumin! The loaded nachos were overpriced ($8+) since they didn't contain any delicious animal flesh of the beef or chicken varieties.
