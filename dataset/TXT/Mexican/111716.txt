G1lB2bUf1MT1FZT8TBy62g Still not disappointed. I stopped in the other night and had a Carne Asada Torta,Cheese quesadilla and a slice of Flan. The torta had a nice texture and was messy but delicious. They didnt skimp on cheese with my quesa. The flan was delicious and fresh and had the right amount of carmel taste. And overall the EMPLOYEES are super friendly.
