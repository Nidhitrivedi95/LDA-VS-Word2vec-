ju1jDr9nF0YCeTNKMYXPVA The food is good. But if you want to try GREAT food you need to head to birrieria Obregon. Anyways, customer service at el Nuevo taquito sucks. when you place your order the lady is RUDE. And hangs up on you. I went to pay and she snatched the debit card. Only thing I don't like, other than that... food isn't so bad!
