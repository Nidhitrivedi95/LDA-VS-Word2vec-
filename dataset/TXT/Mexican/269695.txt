woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ We couldn't get a reservation so we had to sit outside but the food made up for it. The guacamole was great and we enjoyed the street corn as well. We tried the pork and Korean beef tacos which were well seasoned and delicious. My daughter had plain chicken and cheese which were also quite good. Service was attentive and friendly however our meal too over 50 minutes to arrive and for this they lose a point. How long does it take to make 6 tacos??  In my kitchen 10 minutes!  But if you've got the time, check it out and call well in advance to get s seat inside!
