wOk2b8zUHWylJOd6FtNsRw This is so disappointing.  I have been patronizing all of the Sylvias & La Canasta restaurants for 15 or so years.  This was the one that started it all for me.  Somewhere around 2008 is when bad thing started.  I dont know if it was the economy or something else but the proprietor began making changes.  The first thing to go was the chip/salsa bar and thats what brought people in; their hot sauce is amazing.
Then strange wooden statues, atm machine, childrens play area with old used toys.  This was about the time I stopped going to this location.  I mean originally they had bad booth benches/tables/chairs, odd pictures of family (glamour shots?) on the walls but the service was good, the wait staff was good so you could deal with it.  Then came the remodels.  All they ever needed to do was get some good tables and chairs and maybe put some decent Mexican style artwork on the walls and Mexican music and this place would be special.  
Today I came back and its sad.  Its about 1/3 the size it used to be and there were only 2 people working.  One was both a waitress AND the cook.  I feel bad for the staff because its clear theres no support from the owner.  2 people working in a restaurant on a saturday.  2 people got up and left while we were there because it was taking so long.  Its no wonder they're losing business.  
Truthfully, if we could go back to 2008 and have Sylvia literally do the OPPOSITE of everything she did, they would be better off.  It had real potential and I always felt attached to it but no more.
I gave 2 stars out of pure nostalgia but I wont be back and thats sad.
