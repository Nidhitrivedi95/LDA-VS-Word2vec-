lv5Bnqlt93NnvNJ2oNcQ8Q We were traveling and based on reviews decided to give Los Cucos a try. We were not disappointed. The food was exceptional. Our waiter, Dennis, was very conscientious and followed up with the kitchen to see if the sauce had gluten in it. It did, and they substituted a topping that was both gluten free and delicious. We will definitely be back.
