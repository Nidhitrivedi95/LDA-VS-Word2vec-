cgEzHZQKhi2anXfyF75MQw I looooooooove this place! The service is some of the best in Edinburgh - informal and friendly but extremely professional and the food is gorgeous - try the chicken salad with balsamic croutons, mmmmmmm! The cocktail list is brilliant, too - it's a great place to visit if you're a spirits connoisseur, as they have a really excellent, lovely selection. Great for dates / atmospheric meals with friends. Seriously, try this place!
