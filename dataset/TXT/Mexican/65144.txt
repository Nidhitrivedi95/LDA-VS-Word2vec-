b8RNi97OHq5-qn2azbNK-A Are you kidding me? This was absolutely the worst drive-thru service I have EVER experienced!!!! 40 MINUTES IN LINE! I shouldn't have even waited but it got to be almost a joke how long it was taking. How can this place stay in business? When we finally got up to the window to pay, the employee at the register asked me how I was doing. Really? I asked him why it had taken so long, and he said that they were really understaffed (yet I could see another employee behind him at the register leaning on the counter B.S.ing with someone for awhile). Based on similar reviews about the poor service, this is a regular occurrence. The manager should be fired!
