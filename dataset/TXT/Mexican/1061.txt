-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg We ended up walking here because Postino's next door had a 45 minute wait on a Sunday afternoon. And boy, am I glad we did. We ordered the chicken nachos, 3 different tacos. My favorite was the braised beef taco. To drink we had their blood orange margarita, which was phenomenal. 

Only downside is that I couldn't ell who worked there and who didn't. The waiters do not use uniforms or even the same colors. I think the manager was our waiter and he had a Batman shirt on.
