cgEzHZQKhi2anXfyF75MQw 3 words. Homemade tortilla chips.

Had what everyone raved about - guac :)

I know I'm from California so nothing compares and it doesn't, but at least they had delicious chips!!! 

Fajitas were good, tortilla not so much - would be better if it was heated up! 

Don't get the duck tostado or ceviche. Nothing what you would think. 

Great and friendly service so the 4 stars along with the chips. 

Did i say chips?
