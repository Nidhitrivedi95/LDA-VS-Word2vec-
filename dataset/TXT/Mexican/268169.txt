WlBvw6R1Qe2yIaZp-2ilZA PSA - doesn't hit any mark.  Margaritas pitchers, pre made batches and not sure there is any tequila in them.  Salsas bland, no flavor/spice.  Enchiladas pre made, kept in freezer (?), poor taste & odd texture with tortilla.  Bean dip is water consistency. Cute interior gets it a point or two, and waitress tried her best, but for sure not returning.  Actually got in a bit of trouble choosing this restaurant with the spouse...needs a full overhaul of the menu/kitchen, sorry.
