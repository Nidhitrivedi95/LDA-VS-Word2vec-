BUT, oh man the chile beef is so tender. And I love the handmade right-in-front-of-your-eyes flour tortillas. I want that rotating tortilla cooker! I like how you only get meat, rice and beans in your tortilla and then lettuce and pico on the outside. It's nice if you prefer your hot food to stay hot and your cold food to stay cold. But I do miss the corn salsa from Chipotle, and I think their salsas are better there too. But I like how at Rio your burrito gets put through a toaster thing, but this holds up the line.

I also notice they put a lot more meat in the burrito than Chipotle, but then again, prices are higher. The guy in front of us ordered steak and they put a shit ton of it in there. The most popular seems to be the barbacoa pork, which we tried, and didn't like. It's way too sweet, but most Americans seem to like everything on the sweet side.

I've been to both the locations in Centennial, and I like this location better. They don't charge for the creamy tomatillo sauce, in fact they gave us two. The other location across from In N Out on Centennial Pkwy charges for it. Also the Decatur location gave us three stamps on the stamp card for some reason for getting two burritos, and the other location gave us one.

Enchilada style is not really needed, as there is a lot of salsa and cheese on the inside already, and you'll be adding on another buck for that extra splash of salsa verde on top.

I'd definitely give this place more stars if not for the high price.
