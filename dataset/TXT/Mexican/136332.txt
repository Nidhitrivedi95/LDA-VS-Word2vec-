iPDraG9gpzlOQpQhJdPsfg Went for lunch here yesterday.  This was the worst Mexican seafood restaurant I've ever been to. 

First off, lousy service: had to get my own silverware, even had to pickup my order from the kitchen because my server was too busy chatting. 

The only thing worse than the service was the food. Absolutely wretched salsa that was so salty that I nearly spewed. The fish taco was mush and the slaw they used must have been from Fry's. The poblano  stuffed with shrimp and wrapped in bacon was way too salty and the bacon was like burnt shoe leather.

Stay away from this nasty place and don't eat here.. Ever.
