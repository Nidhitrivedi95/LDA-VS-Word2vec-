_rXRnGcU3RFtsehmdL0ucw I will never go back. The beans had a Smokey taste like they were burnt. The service was slow. At 7:30 they were rushing us because they close at 8. Therefore the kitchen staff leaves at 7:45. The enchiladas were dry so I asked for more sauce and they charged me $1.35. I told them I wanted the mini quesadilla for my son from the kids menu and he gave us that AND a cheese crisp and even though I didn't order it I had to pay for that. The green salsa was super sweet as if they poured a ton of sugar in it. The price was super high for what you get. Not impressed.
