PF6IipxqHx0i2cFBAraXPw NOTICE, they open at 10:30 am. I went in at 2:00 pm on a Saturday, ordered enchiladas, and the employee began filling the tortillas and rolling them into the pan when (luckily I was watching or else she would not have said anything) the tortillas completely cracked, I have never seen a tortilla crack from a simple roll unless it was a) stale or b) old, so I asked if there were fresh ones since this is something Cafe Rio preaches on "handmade tortillas rolled fresh by the minute" and I was told they ran out of tortillas and their manager doesn't come in for another 30 minutes. Then I had to decide if I wanted to continue eating there or go somewhere else and at this point I was starving so I settled for less than what I came here for and ordered a burrito. Not to mention, my friend who ordered a burrito in front of me got the bottom of the sweet pork pan so he felt he got skimped on meat. To me, this experience was not worth the $10 plate I paid for. Its unfortunate because I would come here frequently since it is known for its fresh ingredients and quality food (most of the time) but it doesn't take much and an uncaring employee to turn one away! On top of all this commotion, I was not given a receipt which urks me because when I want my opinion to be heard I have no receipt to reference to.
