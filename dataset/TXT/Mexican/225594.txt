RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg I guess this location re-opened. If you're ordering the spicy pork, the line was pretty short. However, I had friends who waited for the asada and beef tongue and the lines were pretty insane. The food is good but I wouldn't wait in line for more than 5 to 10 minutes for the food. Make sure you're in the right line because they have different lines for different meats. 

Payment system is very interesting... it is based on honor system/cafateria style where you order in one spot and pay later in a different spot. They also got rid of their outside seating which was a terrible idea because the whole place was packed with nowhere to sit.
