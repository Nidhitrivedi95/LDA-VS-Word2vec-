knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw I went there a few days ago since it looked good when I was walking around the area.  It was Tuesday so the taco menu was an option in addition to the regular one.

Got the combo and chose a beef tamale and a chicken mole enchilada, with a beef house taco on the side.
Chips were good but a bit oily, they came out hot and seemed to be freshly fried.  The default salsa was great but a bit mild, I asked for the hot one and got one that had a nice heat but seemed to be mainly tomatoes and hot peppers, it lacked the complexity and flavor of the mild one.
The combo plate was larger than I expected, the enchilada was good but nothing spectacular, but the tamale was a nice surprise.  It was made by steaming a sweetened corn mixture in a corn husk, splitting it open, and topping it with a lot more beef than I've ever seen before in a tamale.  Overall it was very good.
The house taco was also good, it was the same beef from the tamale combined with a cilantro lime slaw in a soft corn tortilla.  It had more filling than the tortilla could hold, and it was falling apart trying to hold it all.

Overall not a bad place to eat.
