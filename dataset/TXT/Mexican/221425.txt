rMCKv9puuu2NkYISHnwyWg LOVE their nachos with chicken and no salsa... I get it every time now. They have a wide selection of food and they have a salsa bar so you can add your favorite kids. Not a salsa fan so never tried any of them but the hubby likes a few of them. This location is pretty clean and the people are friendly.
