bCp4qpBzL_chlJtHbiVF5Q I would recommend trying this place. I give it 3.5

Positives:
  I got the Torta Cubana which was very yummy! Their secret sauce is definitely good. It had a lot of flavor, definely NOT bland :)   It is very clean inside.  The girl who took my order was helpful and kind

Negatives:
 The bread is a bit more like a regular sub bread but thinner,  different from other Tortas I've had.  Not my favorite type of bread.   Could have had a bit more meat on the sandwich perhaps?  . I paid around $9 for a whole sandwich and a coke.  This seemed a little pricey to me.  The sandwich did not come with a side.

Tips:
   Overall.. I did like my sandwich!  I will be going back.  I say get the Cubana if you go.
