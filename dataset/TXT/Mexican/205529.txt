pwablDuLsQOdpHAEcNFtww This place is great!! I've always seen it because we go to Harkins movie theater right next to it, but never went in until Friday!! First of all- the ambiance is pretty cool!! Not what I was expecting but it's very relaxed and welcoming!! Second- the drinks at happy hour are very very good, I recommend the sangria swirl! The chips and dip that they bring you are also very good! It's nice to have 3 different salsas to choose from! Super cool :). Third- the food was magnificent!!! I had the Durango burrito and it was AWEEEESOMEEEE!!! Our waiter was very nice, very prompt. It was just an overall awesome experience! Would definitely go back!!
