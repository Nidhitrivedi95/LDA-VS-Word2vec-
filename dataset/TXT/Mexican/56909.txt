A4yJu-Nq1n6nuLP6QKZkrw The drive thru service at this location is ridiculous. Took a while till they asked us for our order.. they waited for the person in front of us to get her order before attending us. Even the lady in front complained because they wanted her to wait some more before she got her total for her order and she said she would drive up to the window instead since there was no cars in front of her. Not sure what they are doing inside since the drive thru is not busy at all and it seems that having a drive thru is useless what's the point? maybe they are understaffed or need to redo their training for drive thru customer service! My family comes to this location 3-4 a month and we are going to look for another location or other eatery because they have been doing unsatisfactory service in the drive thru for a while now. When we arrived home my tostada salad was broken in all places and our wrapped looked messy.
