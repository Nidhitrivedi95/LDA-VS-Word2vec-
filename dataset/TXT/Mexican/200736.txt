PF6IipxqHx0i2cFBAraXPw So, the wife and I have been to several Cafe Duo's and this one is the biggest disappointment. Ill give you an example. I come in hungry as all Hell. I want a steak burrito. So I order one. The young lady says we don't have any and it will take 30 min to get steak. 30 MIN!!! Really? I even offered to cook it (knowingly I couldn't) So I decided on the shredded beef.

 The next gentleman who puts on all the extras I ask what's up with a 30 min wait time for the steak. He looks over his shoulder and back to me and say, "we don't have anyone who can cook it". Seriously!!! Several staff members around and not one can man a effing grill????

So basically I'm extremely concerned that this is what we will have in place as a society. Abeled body persons that don't know how to cook steak. If I wasn't so damn hungry I would have went somewhere else.....

Can't cook steak...... Fucking kidding me..

But what I did order was good. 2 stars for customer service and bad managers not putting the correct people in place to satisfy a customer...
