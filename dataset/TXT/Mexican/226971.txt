S_bG5WWbtNXhhY9Y0GTcSg Really great breakfast spot that is still "semi" hidden from hoards of Phoenix breakfast goers. My husband is obsessed with the croquet Madame and my son loved pastries before they revamped their menu over the 4th of July weekend. I don't think they have pastries anymore...they also have great fresh grapefruit juice!! We love it!
