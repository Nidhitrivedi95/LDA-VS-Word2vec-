Iu2ZINWwyrt9gXliykBEKQ No. Our booth seemed to be falling apart and was put back together with tape. Everything is overpriced PLUS they charge extra for hot sauce. Sangria was just sweetened red wine I don't even really know what was in there. I guess this is an ok place for the area but quality is sub par.
