moZpwq1hNxC-uJRpfupOTA Love the patio! Get there now before the weather is too hot. We had Happy Hour on a Sunday and that included fabulous prickly pear margaritas for $7 and other special prices on apps. The chicken chopped salad is a nice treat if you share a spicy dish with a friend. Ericka was super nice and all the staff is welcoming. We will be back.
