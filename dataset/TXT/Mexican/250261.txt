UJb1PrUWDFfuzwUPc1pP4Q We went there on a Saturday night. Waited 30 minutes in line. The bouncer check my id than says my boyfriend can't get in because of his neck tattoo. There was no dress code posted and there was also others in the bar with neck tattoos and fully covered. It's not Scottsdale it's a college area. Upon looking around I know it wasn't just the neck tattoos it was they he looked which is bullshit. I am never going there again.
