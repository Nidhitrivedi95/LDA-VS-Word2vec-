uBRmZ_h7WP8xesuYqZTFbA I am a transplant from San Diego California.  I grew up spoiled on good authentic Mexican food. I have been looking for years for a good authentic Mexican restaurant. I finally found one. The food here is REALLY good. Their salsa has the right amount of hot and very tasty. I had the Fajita Bowl and it took me back home.  Their sangria was great as well. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for excellent Mexican food.
