qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A Me and my girlfriend have been living in Vegas for almost 2 years and we are big foodies! We accidentally stumbled upon this place and man are we glad we did. Not only
Is the food amazing the service is top of the line. When you come in you get treated like family, your drink is never empty and you never leave unsatisfied. Always ask for Luis he is the absolute best and will have you smiling your whole meal! I wish there was a 6th star because this place deserves it !!!
