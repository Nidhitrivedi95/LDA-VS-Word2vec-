R1k-z3Mauqk4v-7ZeEVsHQ 3.5 stars rounded up.  Our first foray into Salvadoran cuisine.  Half the fun was working out what we wanted with our poor Spanish and the servers poor English.

We weren't very hungry since we had been to Lo-Lo's just a short time before.  The plan was to share 2 entree's between the four of us at Lo-Lo's and then finish our dinner at Guanaquito.  Well, two plates  at Lo-Lo's and the four of us were nearly full.

So we didn't order much at Guanaquito.  Four pupusas:  cheese, bean & cheese, pork and beef.  They were all very good.  I enjoyed the grilled flavor of the bread very much.  Having each bite with cabbage and some hot sauce was tasty indeed.

We also tried some fried yucca.  It was OK but very much like thick cut french fries.
