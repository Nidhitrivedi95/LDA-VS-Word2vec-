ZCe93zAkxr2KOBU1NT0lmg What happened to my Favorite restaurant? I use to come here all the time and it was fabulous. I've been back a few times recently, because I wanted to see if the results would be any different because of a mad rush and that's why all our food was served cold and super greasy. Unfortunately, those few times have been pretty consistent and I'm really disappointed. Now when someone in our group suggests Valle Luna on Bell, I'll opt out and meet them later.
