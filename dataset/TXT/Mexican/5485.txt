_3o05Wdjfc8jOvGZ_q177Q Well we decided to give this place a try.  Now I wish I had looked at yelp first. First off the place looks nice. My first impression is that this place has absolutely no food smells. Very strange for a Mexican Food place. Salsa is chunky watered down and blah. Chips hard and stale. So far not looking promising. I ordered a shredded beef buro and my wife is having the Carne Asada chimi. The menu is extremely basic with nothing special going on other than the high prices for medium to small portions. Both of our food tastes pre made and microwaved. The chimi was not crispy for having been deep fried recently.  This food is not Freshly made its old and very odd. My tortilla is doughy.  Refried beans were old tasting and rice dried out badly. I have eaten Mexican all over the USA and into Mexico. This is the kind of bad food expected from Northern Maine at a place run by a Chinese family who has never eaten Mexican food before. Actually that place might taste better. One last thought. my buro reminder me of eating a frozen buro as a kid but eating it after it has thawed out. You know the white doughy rubbery buro Yum Yum
