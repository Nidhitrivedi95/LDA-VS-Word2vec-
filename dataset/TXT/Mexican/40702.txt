6Ve_2kEz18dvhp4q3M5I2Q I finally stopped and tried this place after driving past it many times and smelling the fantastic aroma from the giant grill in front of the place. They were grilling some chicken and they had some seats set up while you wait for your order to be filled and can watch TV.....(playing current movies in theaters)....I tried 3 Asada Tacos for $1 each and gave him a $2 tip and all I can say is WOW, they were excellent. Each taco had a large portion of meat and some cilantro and onions and for only $1 each I can say I was surprised at how much they served for such a low price. Put on some fresh salsa and some grilled onions and peppers from the serving tray and feasted on a great meal. Thank you Pollo Mobile, I will be making this a weekly stop now.....
