BQJokxJ4y4s57i7Mn65pvA We went here during our stay in Vegas and weren't happy with the service.  Our waiter Cris was impatient while we were waiting to order.  When we asked what kind of fish is in the tacos, he said "fish". We asked if the fish has scales, he replied, "all fish have scales". Eventually he told us the name of the fish and it is similar to shark...not fish nor has scales. We found this information on our own because he didn't think it was important.  We asked due to dietary restrictions that one of our guests had. We go to Vegas often but definitely will not go to this place. 
The food was good but not a fan of the service or lack thereof.
