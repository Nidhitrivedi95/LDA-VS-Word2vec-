ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA had been meaning to go to this place for at least a year after reading about it owners and overall its general persona. little surprised overall.. wasnt what i expected. $9 margarita was ok but nothing special. chips/salsa middle of the road.. my favorite soup, albondigas was not on the menu. ended up ordering the sea bass with tempura batter. nice and fresh was the seafood. beans and rice fairly mawkish. restaurant layout not at all what i expected. personally nothing to draw me back again. 3/12/16 about 2pm..
