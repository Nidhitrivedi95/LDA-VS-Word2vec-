R-sEoZXf37pGzLnid7s6wA The tacos are amazing! Especially the pastor.  And OMG they have limes-- civilization is alive in the Valley of the Sun! They have burritos, quesadillas, and enchiladas, which I'm sure are just as good, but I always end up with the tacos.  They're just too good to pass up.  Prices are reasonable, except the $1.50 they want for a refill on drinks (what?!).  Don't get any hot peppers on your food!
 The place is small, so if you've got a bunch of people you might have to split up at different tables, there are only two and four-seaters.  It seems to be pretty clean, even the onesie bathroom isn't super gross.  My only concern is the sketchy neighborhood.  Its not the sketchiest place I've ever eaten tacos (that honor goes to Friendly's gas station tacos in Dallas, Tx!), but let's just say I wouldn't be comfortable stopping here after sunset.  The bar next door looks like they plucked it straight up out of a Mexico City barrio-- some scary stuff going on in there, I'm sure of it.  Like they need a concertina fence around the parking lot, seriously.  Daytime is the time to come here, enjoy your tacos, and get the hell out.  Situational awareness should be stressed, however, even in the sunshine!
