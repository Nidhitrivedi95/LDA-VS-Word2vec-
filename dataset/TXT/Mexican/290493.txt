Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Beautiful place to sit down & enjoy brunch. The complimentary bread was rather good; there were 4 varieties: cheese, bacon, spices, & one I can't remember. Assorted pastries was average with the notable one being the banana Nutella one. Skip the drinks.. the smoothie w/ balsamic vinegar was odd, the cranberry smoothie (w/ purple potato, banana, & yogurt) tasted good but the consistency was really starchy - a very filling type of drink, the flight of fruit juices was so-so. Shrimp sandwich was decent. Soft shell crab sandwich was really good; crab is fried but not greasy, almost tasted like a "healthy" sandwich.
