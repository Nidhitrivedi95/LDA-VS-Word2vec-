Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg Lunch service in west Las Vegas location. This must be some place since everyone was of Latin decent.
This place is kid friendly. Good lunch choices from 10-16 dollars. Taco enchiladas etc served with refried beans and rice with beverage service, chips and cup of soup. 
I had chille rellenos with shrimp, generous portion with white wheat tortillas. 
Cost about 10$ per person.
Well worth its local reputation.
