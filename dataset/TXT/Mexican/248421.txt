U8ixm-xr4QLjyD5L38ooAA Fresh, quick and decently priced. Big Fat Burrito has come to  be one of my favourites in the city. I love the Yam Burrito so much I never deviate and still have yet to try their other ones or tacos.

Open late, this location is a godsend when you're in the mood for after gig food that isn't gross. The crowd of boozy folk can be a deterrent at times, but staff are fantastic and handle them well.

There are a couple of seats by the window at this location, but it's generally a take out joint. I like that their small is pretty substantial yet you're still able to walk home while eating it without it going everywhere. All in all, burrito yay!
