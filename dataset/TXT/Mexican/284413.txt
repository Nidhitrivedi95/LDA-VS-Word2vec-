xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw I came here during a long lunch break coming from the Convention Center on light rail. So glad I made the trek! Never had fry bread before and it reminded me of bhattura in India Indian cuisine. So tasty! Their menu has a lot options but I went with a regular fry bread option. Would try a stew next time!
