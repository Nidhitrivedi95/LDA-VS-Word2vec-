The food? Yawwwn. ZzzzzzZzzzz. Someone wake me up.

The service leaves something to be desired.

I used to frequent the downtown Willoughby location. It wasn't open very long because it was even worse than the original location. I had a lemongrass soup there once and it tasted like some sort of household cleaner. 

If it weren't for the lovely drinks I'd give this joint 1 star. I know, I know. You could get drinks like these anywhere... I'm TRYING to be a tiny bit nice here.
