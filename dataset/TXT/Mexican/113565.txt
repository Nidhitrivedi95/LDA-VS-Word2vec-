gDOuHjntsN37XEjROoQ2Aw Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Been here a few times and comparing it to all the fish tacos out there, can't give it a 4.  This is good, not great.  Not bad at all, just not phenomenal.  

Major plus for having the creativity to carry a fish machaca taco.  A major negative from this last trip - got my throat stuck with a bone.  Some people would give 0-2 stars for this, this isn't that kind of place and I'm not that kind of reviewer.  But this pace can do better, and picking out all the bones should be a baseline for quality.  Also, with how wet it is and how much they give, it could use 2 tortillas.

It's not really Baja-style here.  Fried fish tacos in Baja were adapted from Japanese immigrants to the area using tempura-style batter.  Light, crispy.  The coating here is thin with some crispness but not the same as tempura-style.  Again, it's not bad, it's just not traditional Baja.

Also, it's more like a make-your-own taco here, with all the condiments on the side including the cabbage, onions, cremas, and salsas.  Great if you are picky about what goes into your taco, but I'd be interested to see what the kitchen would do if they composed the entire taco.

So not bad, not great.  Value is good for the volume, but compared to the best fish tacos I've had, gotta stick to 3 stars.
