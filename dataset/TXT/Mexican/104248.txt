fCpPsX76xgs4BKLe_uxAMQ Probably as good as it gets for burritos! I walked into this place while looking for food and it was packed (for good reason too). The lady guided me on how to order, very sweet. This location is very generous on the stuffings/toppings, food was fresh and hot! Go try it at least once! I know it's a bit pricey but you won't regret it as a once in awhile treat!
