OA5Li3ySzhrbG_WvD_QGYA For a place who's main focus is tacos, I was not impressed.

The highlights:  great patio, salsa's, sauces & toppings

The lowlights:  the protein.  The braised beef was very sweet.  Too sweet.  Pulled Pollo did not appear as pulled chicken.  It appeared as pre cooked chicken in chunks like you would buy at the grocery store that had some seasoning thrown on as an afterthought.  Not much flavor at all.  While the pulled pork was the best of the three, it was cold !  Now that I think about it, all the meats were cold !

I'll give it some time before I go back, I hope they get things sorted out as the concept is great and who doesn't love a good taco ?
