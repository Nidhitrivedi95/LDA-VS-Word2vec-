vpwyL6NHm-pTWJ5IeJb9yw During my one and only visit to Cocina Mendoza, I had perhaps one of the most disappointing meals I've ever eaten in a Mexican restaurant, and because of this I will never return. It wasn't so much the bland flavor of the food or the crappy salsa. It was the deception, which is why I will not give the place a second chance. I ordered the Carnitas Burrito. Instead of tender,braised pork shoulder, this burrito was stuffed with tiny cubes of tough, dry, lean pork-chop meat, or something like that. Cutting corners in this manner and attempting to fool me is not a good idea if you want my business. Additionally, the guacamole was dark and industrial looking, as if it came from a factory. Exactly what happened to the "authentic" Mexican recipes at Cocina Mendoza on their journey from Mexico to Castle Shannon is a mystery. And I'm not sure I want to know the real answer. The only reason this gets two stars is that the guy who waited on me, though inattentive, was nevertheless friendly. Avoid this restaurant.
