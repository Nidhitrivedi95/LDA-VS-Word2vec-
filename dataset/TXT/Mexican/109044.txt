frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A This place has gone done hill, and their prices are ridiculous now. Today is the last time I think I'll be patronizing this joint. I'll miss their amazing salsas, but not the dirty tables and floors, or or the really loud music, or the slow service or the ridiculously overpriced food items. Too many choices when it comes to yummy Mexican food in this town, and this place got a little too big for their britches IMHO. You gotta try harder people! I hate when places get popular like this, and decide it's cool to gauge people and not put their best foot forward.
