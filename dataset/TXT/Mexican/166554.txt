LpVNpw2-Bn9iHVON33auKw Had lunch here today.
Ordered al a carte : 3 rolled tacos ( shredded beef) 
Came with a bit of shredded lettuce, grated cheese and a small sour cream and guacamole.
They do carry bags of hot carrots/ jalapeños located near the register. Each bag is .49 cents.
EVERYDAY- between 7 & 9 AM they offer a free coffee with a purchase of a breakfast burrito.
Plus side a salsa bar. However, red medium is canned tomorrow with a few spices. They have a red hot- it's hot! Green is just average in flavor, pretty watery. They have a fresh Pico, lime wedges, radishes and fresh chopped cilantro. 
The rolled tacos were skinny & over fried. Meat was in turn over cooked and tough inside. 
Guacamole was bland.
Plus side: offer a lot of options. Dine in or
Take Out. Clean restaurant & restrooms. 
Unfortunately, I won't be back.
