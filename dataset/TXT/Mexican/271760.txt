WrkOKBHkRxhBVpX8qu7zDA I eat here nearly everyday! Everything tastes and smells fresh and it's pretty affordable on a college student budget! I recommend going when they first open and 11 instead of 12-2 for lunch as it gets pretty crowded but they are still timely even when there are a lot of people!
