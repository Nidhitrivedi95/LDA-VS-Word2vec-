gldPX9ANF5Nic0N7igu2og Is it just me or has there been a huge surge in taco joints downtown recently? But who can complain about more tacos! I stopped in on a Tuesday because Taco Tuesdays are a weekly holiday for me. The ordering style is similar to a Burgatory or Stack'd where you bubble in your order on a scantron-like form. 

We started off with the trio of dips - guac, queso, and salsa. The chips are made in-house which was great because they're fresh but not so great because they were drenched in oil and lathered in salt. When it came to the main entrees, I give them props for having not one, not two, but THREE vegetarian proteins - tofu, mushroom, and jackfruit. The sauce on the tofu was delicious, but the chewy, jaw crushing tofu was a no-no. The jackfruit texture was better on the jaws, but it tasted overly sweet. All of the additional sauces you can throw on your taco are SPICY, holy cow. I'll admit that I'm not the best with spicy foods, but if there's 1 flame next to sauce on the menu, I'm expecting a light touch of spice, not a smack in the face. I never knew I could sweat that much from a taco. 

Service was very spotty since we came in during the happy hour specials. Our waiter was great, very personable, but as the time went on, he would be too busy with other tables to check in on us at all (which sucks when your mouth is on fire and you're begging for a refill). Taste-wise, Condado didn't do it for me. I was very disappointed with both tacos that I got and even the chips & dip appetizer. Unfortunately, a 2/5 for me.
