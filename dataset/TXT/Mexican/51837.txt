9ehTNgvu0vZgHjWkQqF6KQ This is a really quaint place and the service was exceptionally fast. We were seated instantly and the food came out very quick too.
They give free chips & salsa. The salsa is a little watery but very tastey, and the chips come out nice and warm. They have quite the selection when it comes to their menu. Its really hard to find a mexican food place that serves albondigas. Needless to say, that's what I ordered with a sour cream green chicken enchilada and rice + beans. They a very generous with their cheese. Overall, it was delicious and I pretty much ate until I nearly popped.
Our server's name was Tryon and he was a pretty friendly fellow. Not overly in your face, but tentive and smiley. My boyfriend's order came out wrong (the reason for the four stars), but we didn't complain because it was still awesome. I definitely enjoyed my experience.
