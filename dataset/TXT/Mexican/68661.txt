It has a nice patio and the food is acceptable.
The food was not outstanding but perhaps you are paying for the location and not great food. The food was good, the selections were good, just not great. 
You are paying watch boats go by and judging by the service, you will see many boats go by.
We had six in our party and the wait was about 45 minutes, not too bad considering it was a late Saturday afternoon. 
But that was just the beginning of the wait. After the waiter took our drink order, it was a very long 15 minutes before they arrived. Did the waiter take our food order when he brought the drinks? No. Another 15-20 minute wait on that.
We asked for drink refills when we ordered food. Another long wait for those. The food took about 30 minutes to arrive. 
The day was hot, about 95 and we were thirsty. 
After the food was gone, another long wait to get the check and about ten minutes to get the receipt to sign.
Maybe because they just opened up and don't know how many people to staff a Saturday night but being in the business, you would think they would just know how many people should be working. Either they are understaffed or just don't know (or care), is anyone's guess.
It was two hours from when we sat down to when we left. Awful service, food is too pricey for the horrible service. Next time I am in that area, I'll go to Crop Rocks.
