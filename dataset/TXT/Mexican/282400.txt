You restaurant was awesome. But might I add, one of your chefs might of over marinated my boyfriends ribeye a little too much. You know? But let me tell you that bbq duck with blue corn pancake was spectacular!!! So good I almost fainted with joy :). The lamb chops were tender and cooked perfectly, i almost didn't think I was eating lamb chops. Good stuff! Until my stomach mets your food again. :)

Janet :)
