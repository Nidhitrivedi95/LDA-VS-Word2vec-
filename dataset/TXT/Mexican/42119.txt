74PuNP7egqbaloqDecGsrA So after my photoshoot, I decided to take myself out to dinner because I was looking real good in my makeup.  This restaurant is in the same plaza as the studio.

It is a cute litte Mexican restaurant with great décor, a full service bar, and 3 TVs.  The service was very friendly, though it took a while for them to take my order (but that was the only down side to it),

As I mentioned before, I am a "flex vegan" so today I was really learning on my flex part.  When they brought out my chips in salsa, I wanted something more with it.  So I noticed they offered a bean dip.  Which in my mind it would only have beans.  Nope!  It was mixed with some yummy cheese!  So I was very satisfied with both the bean dip and the salsa.  The salsa had a nice little kick to it, which I LOVE spicy things!

For my meal, I order the vegetarian fajita platter.  It was so much food that I ate on it for 3 days!  The flavor was amazing and it had carrots in broccoli in the mix, which I appreciated.  I think this was a great decision for me to treat myself here after my photoshoot.  I would say it is a great place to bring kids to or just you and some friends if you are craving mexian and/or a margarita.
