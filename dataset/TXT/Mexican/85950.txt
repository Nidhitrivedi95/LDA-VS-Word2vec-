Db3CfZWrtG33UZSs8Tdlsg I have eaten here a few times. I wanted to give the place a fair shot before I completely dismissed it. The food is inconsistent. The first time we ate there, the empanadas were cold. We were told they were still training new cooks. The other time I ate there was fine... However, we ate there again and we were served the wrong taco and the wrong burrito. Another time,  there was a giant bay leaf (inedible) inside my burrito. The final time I ate there, they did not include cheese in the burrito AND the rice was crunchy. 

They really need to get their act together and work on CONSISTENCY. Cook the food, keep it fresh, pay attention to what you're doing in the kitchen.
