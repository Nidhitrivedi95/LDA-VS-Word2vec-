BToSTEiaK94G3h5_XROEcA This place is fantastic!  My family and I have been huge fans since they were located at the Fiesta Plaza at Carrowinds!  They have the absolute best tamales I have eaten in the Charlotte area and possibly any restaurant.  I can't say enough about how good the tamales are but their other menu items are delicious also.  The Chimichangas are out of this world and the fajitas are good too.  I love the food here, the atmosphere and the prices can't be beat.  If you are looking for great mexican food at a great price look no further because you have found it here!  I hope you'll stop by and find out for yourself!
