lINk_EU_elY6iTrfUGcRqg After waiting inside in line for 20 minutes, we were informed by the cashier that they were out of chicken and it would be a 15 minute wait. Don't you think our time is valuable Mr. Manager? How about let's us and the 20 people behind us know your out of chicken so we can go somewhere else?! Horrible customer service. Words of wisdom... put more chicken on the grill at dinner time especially on a Friday.
