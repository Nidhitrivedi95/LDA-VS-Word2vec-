diCzUUimdr19isftmiIu_g Certainly not the best Mexican food I've ever had but this is Montreal after all. The service was exceptional. The restaurant itself is kind of grungy but happy and festive. The rice was strange...easily could have stood in at a Chinese takeout joint. The eggplant app was really good. Everything else, in my opinion, lacked flavor. Chocolate/flan cake for dessert was divine! Don't go with high expectations for great food and your experience will be just fine. The waitress couldn't have been nicer.
