The service was awesome here, the guy was very attentive to us, came by and asked if all the things were good including the food. Even offered if I wanted my left over lemonade drink to go. Now that is service. A+++

If you're undecided and not really sure what to get, try the lunch special combo - appetizer, entrée, and dessert for only $25. And let me tell you it was quite fulfilling unless you have a huge appetite. 

For my choices:
App: corn tamales (didn't see this in the regular menu) - one was softer than the other but I kind of liked it even though I'm not a huge fan of actual corn pieces in the tamales. 

Entrée: grilled fish tacos (2pc) with 2 sides of rice and black beans, the tacos were tiny and they were about average tasting. 

The bf got taquitos and they actually gave out a better portion of taquitos than mine. Oh well...He liked it. 

Dessert: there's only 1 choice and it is coconut flan, now I didn't taste the actual coconut cause there wasn't any in the flan and just coconut flakes. However, the flan was good and not overly sweet because the syrup was designed into a hard candy on top of it. 

We also tried the ceviche, the Baja and Caribbean. Caribbean was unique and it wasn't too bad, I liked the sauce they used. 

Complimentary tortilla chips and 3 sides of salsa were given. I think that's what also stuffed me beforehand since I was starving. 

I'd definitely come back and try the other foods next time I'm in Vegas.
