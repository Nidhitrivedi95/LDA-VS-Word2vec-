5OAO9TxfvsvccFFD4pjmeg I love Mexican food and I think this restaurant is very underrated - it also makes me sad to see all the bad reviews because I've never had a bad experience there, nor have the people with me! 

I am pretty sure this is a family-owned place so the service isn't the best as it is usually just one server who hustles the entire time (but I don't think it takes away from my dining experience). Also, everything feels really authentic which I absolutely love!

As for the food, I usually get the fish or shrimp tacos because I don't eat beef, etc, and they are always phenomenal. In fact, my ONLY complaint is that I always forget to ask for no cilantro and being Mexican, they love to use cilantro. As for the other people that I have gone with, they have also loved the place and their food (beef tacos, enchiladas, and I can't remember the rest), and we are always very happy to go back. 

So if you love Mexican food, I highly recommend you give this place a try!

Oh, parking is also easy as they have a small lot and you can park on the street.
