tNJgmbODR-N0qdPGy4Vsrw Just ate here again last weekend for the first time in months.  I can't believe I went so long without paying a visit.  I've never had a bad meal at this restaurant.  The chips and salsa are addicting...So much so, in fact, that I've actually ordered a Styrofoam to-go cup of the salsa before.  If this kind of clearly ravenous lust for tomato-y, onion-y, cilantro-y goodness isn't your style, at least get all you can while you're at the restaurant -- refills on chips and salsa are free.  Prices overall are reasonable.  This is the only Mexican restaurant I've eaten at where I've actually finished my whole entree before, and enjoyed every bit of it.

My favorite dishes are the chimichangas and the flautas (if I'm remembering correctly, the meat is shredded in these, and I like the texture, flavor, and tenderness of the shredded chicken or beef vs. the diced), but really anything is good -- even the spinach burritos!  The lunch portions are still large, but not ridiculously large.  Look for the daily lunch and dinner specials on the small chalkboard hanging on the wall in front of you just after entering from outside, to the left of the door to the dining room.  

I don't think we've ever had to wait for a table.

El Jalapeno's also boasts some of the largest margaritas around, but I hear they're a little light on the alcohol.  Might be worth trying, though, if only for the "I did it" factor.

Truthfully, it's one of my favorite places in Lakewood.  Mmmm, Mexican!
