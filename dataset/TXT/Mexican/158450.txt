kqTek_oBEKOKpIHI12JYhQ This place is AWESOME!  The food is filling, fairly priced, and just the perfect thing for this vegetarian mom, and equally vegetarian 18 year old son.  He had the burrito, and loved the flavor and texture, I had the spinach quesada, and was equally impressed.  The chips are off the hook!  The staff is friendly, and informative.  The place is comfortable.  We were disappointed that after eating one meal, that they were closing that day, and did not reopen until after we left.  Just so thankful to have had the chance to try it.  I would not miss this food pleasure, even if you do eat meat.
