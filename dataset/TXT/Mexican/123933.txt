HnQVDNGFWOS5zle0dhpOkw I had a foot long burrito that starts at $4.99, I opted for carne asada which adds $2 and cheese which added $1. I'm a very athletic 6'1 215lb guy with a voracious appetite. For $8 I got two meals out of that burrito. Great value and flavor was good enough to order again. 

My lady friend had the 2 taco chicken platter which she enjoyed very much. I tasted the chicken and it was tasty.

I'll definately be going back to Baja Taco and I too hope to see them around and wish them good luck with their endeavor.

I must add that I almost walked straight out the door when I walked in because they didn't have the tray of jalapeno's and carrot's like Roberto's and most other taco shops have. I love that stuff so much in fact that the majority of the time the actual reason I go to Roberto's or similar places is because I'm craving the peppers and carrots and just using the food as something to go with them.
