fbQaKW0Lte0JQ_opbnjdKg I've always wanted to try this place, and I'm so glad I went! The food was excellent. I tried the 2 enchilada platter, one chicken and cornbread and the other green chile pork, both with green sauce and crema. 50/50 corn and flour tortillas, and both cheeses. The meat was very tender and flavorful and the corn gave it that tamale masa flavor. It's a fast casual concept, so the setup and dining area is pretty basic and they're not the most attractive/comfortable tables. Honestly if they did a little decorating and made it comfortable this place would get 5 stars.
