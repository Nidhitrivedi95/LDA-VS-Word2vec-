tmKr2Vvu6I0zJ6kjrS949w Got their shrimp naked bowl with tortilla on the side. Great portion size for $15 (after tax). Tons of fillings but the spice level was mild (even though I asked for medium spice!). 
The food was freshly prepared and was flavourful! Only thing I did not appreciate was the packing - I got it to go and it was so leaky and wet. Not a good take-out item.. that's for sure!
