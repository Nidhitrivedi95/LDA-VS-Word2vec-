MZRqxvBkJLjKcoOjNz7yLA The "manager" here is the absolute worst human being I've encountered with my entire life. He screamed in my face, cursed at me, held me and my group hostage, and threatened our lives tonight. A "manager" should NEVER treat a customer this way, especially if they want to make money. This place is a dump and honestly is 100% because of the stank attitude from the management and wait staff. Even the security team were complaining about him and encouraged us to call corporate on the establishment. It's sad when the casino doesn't even want to be associated with this place. They're a total embarrassment to the Flamingo. Glad he lives in Vegas so he'll be used to the heat in Hell while he's rotting away.
