BHMqFvtguSDrZLQPtjZSuA I told the owner there was too much salt in the carne asada meat from time to time. Instead of providing good customer service and talking to me, he said I was the only one that ever complained about it. This is not true. I have at least 2 friends who eat and have the same complaint. Horrible customer service, especially coming from the owner. By the way, I have been going there for 4 or 5 years.
