XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Dinner here was probably my least favorite Vegas dining experience. I'll admit that I was dragged here along with a large group. I didn't want to go some place this nice, so I understand how it may seem unfair to give 3 stars because of the price point. But seriously, I ordered the appetizer lobster tacos as my meal. It was $20. It was, no exaggeration, 3 bites. 3 small tacos. One bite each. The flavor was out of this world, but I left feeling as if I didn't even eat. The waitress did a good job dealing with our large, fairly drunken party at such an upscale place, but wish she had advised me about the portion size.
