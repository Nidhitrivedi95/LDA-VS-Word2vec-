2XkVexeY_8zyc9nriSElQg Worst Mexican food I've had in Vegas...and a 4 star average rating? I stopped by here the other night after a 12 hour shift at the CES show working on their antiquated networks so I was hungry. I ordered 4 street tacos and a burrito. The food was completely inedible. The street tacos: asada and carnitas. Dry old tasting tortillas and probably a half a teaspoon of very mediocre meat. But it doesn't stop there. The worst part is they put this lime green mystery whatever that's like a combination of mayonnaise and I don't know. It was HORRIBLE AND DISGUSTING! Almost made me puke! Couldn't even eat them. The al pastor burrito was nothing to write home about either. I can't really comment because they only put specs of meet. They're also disgustingly FILTHY. The lady I asked for salsa was cutting meat and handed me salsa with her meat gloves that touched my hands. My hands were not clean as I had just used the restroom at the convention center and there was no soap to wash my hands after handling my humongous sized package. GROSS! Feel sorry for the people who got some extra "flavor " on their sh*tty tacos.
