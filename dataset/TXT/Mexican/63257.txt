ayaDm0WPZB0g0PYbGFkrzA Me and my best friend were going to go to The Yard and the parking was confusing so we turned into the next possible parking lot and we saw Casa Añejo and they said they had happy hour from 3-6pm daily. So we decided to sit at he bar and Sav (Salvador) was my bartender and he was nothing but amazing service. They have an amazing happy hour and good vibes plus the resturant itself is beautiful , definitely recommend this resturant if you're in the area! Sal works wed-sat so hopefully you get him!
