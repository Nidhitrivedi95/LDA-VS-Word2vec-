My favorite, by far, is the General Tso Chicken.  Anything that they have on the Chinese menu that is spicy can be made without the spicy.  That's how I roll with the General Tso's.

If you go there, you must get an egg roll.  Hade-made on the premises.  Best egg roll I have ever eaten.  They are so good, I tell random strangers to try them, and then the strangers tell me to try them the next time I'm there.
