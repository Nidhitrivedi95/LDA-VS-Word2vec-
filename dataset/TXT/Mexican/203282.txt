pomGBqfbxcqPv14c3XH-ZQ I just adorable this place. Hands down one of the best places for their rib eye tacos. I usually get al a carte cooked to your liking it's delicious and you could thank me later. You really can't go with their menu. I've also tried the sopa de consomé (chicken and rice broth soup with onions, cilantro and jalapeños on the side with a mini quesadilla made with fresh cheese) I give it two thumbs up but I wish it was just a little warmer. 

I usually sit in the bar and the staff is attentive it only seating 10 and all but I usually play and always leave winning. Can't beat that.
