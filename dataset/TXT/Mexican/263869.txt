WB3nXcDioVvGax2u5_jXhw Johnny Bananas is a true authentic Latin American restaurant, unlike any other in Toronto.  Started by a Mexican couple, this restaurant used to have a full menu and bar, but it has since been turned into an in-and-out kind of joint.  

There are a lot of places to grab a burrito in the city but no one uses fresh ingredients like they do.  When you eat a burrito from other places, you usually feel weighed down and tired after.  You won't feel that way after eating anything from JB's.

Highlights for me include:  Cactus tacos, fresh guacamole, alfalfa sprout burrito.  And surprisingly enough, their side salad is fruity and delicious.  Meat eaters will still rejoice in their menu, have no fear.

Because of the location (tucked away on Bathurst Street) and Toronto's burrito-obsession, I think this place doesn't get the credit it deserves.  If you're looking for another Burrito Boys you're not going to get it here.  Be prepared for something authentic and original.  

Everyone there is really nice and the vibe is cool.  You won't want to walk away with the food, but rather eat in and read a paper instead.
