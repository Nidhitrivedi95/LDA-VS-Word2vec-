dZh_YnKaX41cPHg1nTOx-g I love this chipotle! It always has short lines and one worker there is so much fun, one time I was dancing with my friend in line (long story ) and now every time I walk in (which is quite a lot) he always waves, smiles, laughs, and mimics my dance in the funniest way possible. In all seriousness I truly enjoy this chipotle and I have it at least 4 times a week (unfortunately I'm not exaggerating). I cannot recommend this location enough
