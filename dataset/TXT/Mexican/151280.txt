Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ The epic debate of how many stars to give! Almost gave 3, but...
First off, on the food, I've had only had the guacamole and I loved it. I'm an admitted avocado whore so it's hard to not make me love guac. 
Usually when I come to Cabo Wabo it's to have drinks outside and people watch (perfect spot for it).
I would give this place 5 stars if I could always sit at the bar top outside... primarily because that's how I know my drinks are amazing! And I do mean amazing. Whenever I've ordered a drink from a server, it tends to come to me...not what I had ordered (hence 3 stars). I'll admit when it comes to margaritas I'm relatively particular, but I'm pretty clear about what I'm looking for. 
Either way, it's still my favorite "cantina" on the strip, and will always fight for a seat at the bar top. Wait, I'm off tomorrow! I'm so overdue.
