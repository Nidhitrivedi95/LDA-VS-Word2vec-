lWmDrnqgU6w3gFaJyn_1Uw I am straight up in LOVE with the fried goat cheese balls at radio maria. i was super excited to go and enjoy some of the deliciousness that is the food, however, last week i went in with a friend and we were seated and then literally sat there for 7 minutes before someone came over to us. I was just the hostess, who said that a waiter would be over in a minute. That minute was another 7 minutes, and we didn't even have a drink order in, so we got up to leave (as we were super hungry.) The hostess shrugged and was totally unapologetic about the terrible service, so we went to jupiter's and had some delicious pizza and beers for 1/4 the price of what we were going to order.
