MesBAxNk_M7ISbBmVDiiWQ As a self proclaimed Mexican food/taco expert, I have to give this place 5 stars. My first experience here started off a little rocky, but have been so impressed with everything that this has easily become one of my absolute favorite spots for some authentic Mexican food. I first tried this place on my birthday this past March. They had just recently opened and were getting into the swing of things. I called about a week in advance to make a reservation as we had 14 people, which they said they could accommodate. When we arrived, they seemed to have no knowledge of a reservation,  it quickly scrambled to find us a spot. The place was packed, but they were able to give us two tables near each other. Once seated, I ordered a margarita that was served inside a pineapple! It was awesome. Our food took quite a while to arrive, but we were given a bunch of free appetizers as an apology. The chorizo fireballs are to die for, so I was happy. The food overall is excellent. 
     After the few hiccups we experienced here on the first try, I decided to come back again a few months later. This time, the place was crowded, but not packed. We were seated right away and ordered a pitcher of margaritas to share. The margaritas are good in my book. Our service was great, food was amazing, and this place was solidified as a regular option for me. Definitely worth a try!
