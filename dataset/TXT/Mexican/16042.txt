19S0gFtg5GTX6CkiApJiAQ I am so glad I went to this place by accident. I was going to Tasty BBQ Kitchen next door, but it turned out they don't open on Tuesday. Lucky for me, I was super hungry and went Frijoles, since it was right next door. I had the best tacos I have ever had in my life, definitely going back for more.
