Highly recommend the flautas as a starter - crispy, topped with the right amount of sour cream, cheese, tomatoes and guac. I usually get the pork tacos, which have the right amount of spice balanced out with pineapple. 

The hot sauce is homemade and amazing (very spicy). You can buy bottles of it to take home, which many of my friends do after having it for the first time.
