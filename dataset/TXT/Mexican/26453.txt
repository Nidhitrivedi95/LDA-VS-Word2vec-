3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ After work....on a Sunday....Fathers Day. But thanks to Taco Guild, that frown turned upside down.
First off, the interior is absolutely gorgeous. It's an old church, although you can drink yourself silly if you choose.
We had their fish tacos. For lunch, the prices were good for larger than street size tacos. Plenty of fish bites in the tacos. 2 each were enough. It came with a side of beans and rice, both also very tasty. 
The food and service were great, but I wasn't impressed with the beer bloody Mary drink. I normally love bloody Mary's, but not this concoction. 
So glad we found this place by a random drive by.
