kxzS-zh5nUNvBzYz2Q47pg We were staying at the Boulders Resort for a weekend getaway and the resort staff suggest this restaurant. We started with the ceviche and the queso.  The ceviche was good but a little heavy on the cilantro. The queso came out way too hot to eat and separated as it cooled. 

For the entree, we wanted to split the carne asada. I find it odd that the server ask me how we wanted it prepared. Now I am an AZ native and this is the first time I have ever been asked how I wanted my carne asada prepared. When it came out it was raw with little carne favor. Sent it back and the next plate was over cooked, chewy and not good. 

Service was good but food left us going back the the resort for more beer to mask the bad food.
