-jghjupgk9DVw5M-dCr3mw Slooooow service...I'm talking snail level 20-30 minutes to get your food. I wouldn't mind if the food was worth it.  IF it's great tasting and leaves me hoping I can swing by again real soon - then I'll gladly wait and still give a good review. Trust me, average tasting food at best. Don't get me wrong, I have the three strikes you're out view when it comes to bad reviews for a restaurant. This one hit it - three times in a row slooooow snail level to get my food and the food was not worth that 20+ minute wait each time. Average tasting food items as the day is long.
