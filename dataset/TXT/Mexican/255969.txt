vf-OLMuP-EB1vlqVGUx4CQ Absolutely the worst food and atmosphere ever!  It's St Patrick's Day and the music was so loud and horrible and then to top it off...so was the food!  I've been coming here for years for cocktails and wings, but I can honestly say, I will never be back!  We ordered the nachos and they served it with just chips and beef...no cheese, no salsa, no tomatoes...nothing!  I'm not one to usually complain but Billy and Eddie, it was pathetic!  Taco Bell serves better food!
