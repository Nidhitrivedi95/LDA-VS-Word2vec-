CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q This place is off the strip, but worth the drive and wait. The place is small and the lines are long. Its a good idea to come with more then 2 people, so you can wait in both lines to get what you want. The price is cheap. The corn tortilla are made fresh like everything there. The steak taco and spicy pork taco on point. They were so delicious. Service was ok because it's crazy busy. Its a must stop location. I want to come back.
