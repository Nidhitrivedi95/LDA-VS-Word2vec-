BgQ5ob0QiZfO5YbgI7VyFw I saw this restaurant on Check Please AZ and decided to give it a try. I made a reservation as there were 4 of us annd I knew it would be busy because of the show. We were sat immediately and our server came quickly for drinks and brought tri-colored chips and salsa.  She then took our order. We all ordered the stacked enchiladas but each a bit different from the other. Now for the not so good stuff.  About 15 minutes later she came back to us to say she forgot to put in part of our order and needed to verify everything that was ordered. So we gave her our order again and waited.......and waited........and waited. Finally, after waiting over an hour, our food came.......and did it was AMAZING! Each enchilada had a generous amount  of meat, and the green chili sauce was sooooo flavorful. They all came with rice and beans.  The waitress came by again to ask us how the food was and to apologize for the wait. Along with our table issue, there was a party of 14+ that came in just before us and they threw off the reservation schedule.  

Despite all the issues, we all want to go back again as there are other items on the menu we want to try.
