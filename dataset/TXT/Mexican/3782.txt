-PKUAor_Nz_IaNjP_jIwyA I've visited two of this restaurant's locations (the original and the Hacienda). The service is always excellent, and the decor is nice. Its a great place for crowds of all ages - I've visited with friends and family (including my 85 year old grandparents). 

We always order their guacamole and chips. The chips are made to order and arrive warm and incredibly crisp. The guacamole is fresh and the flavours are well-balanced.

I've tried a few of their tacos, but I keep coming back to the ancho-braised shortrib. Its decadent without being heavy, and the crunchy cabbage slaw makes the dish. I love how they serve their tacos on lettuce leaves. 

My boyfriend swears by their original burrito. Its served with an amazing roja sauce, guac, crema, fresh chillies and cilantro. 

Protip: some of the seats seem quite exposed to the elements. We visited once on a very cold day and had to keep our coats on the entire time. It was annoying, but we were willing to stick it out in exchange for delicious and authentic Mexican food.
