E_DXCeVllZtHV93hsAIZvw I sampled them this past Monday night. One each of a Tripa, Buche, Asado and Chorizo. Buche would be the only thing that left me wanting...lack of taste and texture altogether. The others were yummy. Though using factory-made corn tortillas, they do grill one side into some golden brown char that both seems to strengthen the tortilla as you squeeze it, but adds a nice extra to the taste.  Both house salsas were just meh....one verde and one rojo. I saw no other options, so I just ate most of the tacos without any. 

While not bad, I'd only stop here again due to severe weather. Why? Right around the corner is The Tacos Saguayo coach, at 28th st and MCdowell offering a much better product at the same, or even less cost....with a GREAT house red and green salsa offering...Plus, though seated outside under canopy, you at least get some airflow, sadly lacking inside TS.
