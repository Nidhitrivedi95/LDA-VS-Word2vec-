ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA It's possible that I've had worse service somewhere, but can't remember where. It took about 15 minutes after being seated to flag down a waiter to get water and a menu - another ten to place a drink order, yet another 10 to find out that one of the ingredients for the holiday drink special was unavailable, so my companion said, "that's OK just make it without that ingredient." It took another 5 minutes for me to find the manger, have the waiter return only to tell my friend that the bartender doesn't make the drink without the ingredient. The lunch took nearly 60 minutes to arrive.

The food quality was very uneven. My soup was excellent, but my friend's fish and chips order was flavorless and overcooked.

Very, very loud.
