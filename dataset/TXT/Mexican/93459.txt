e4NQLZynhSmvwl38hC4m-A I don't know what took me so long to try this place that's just five minutes from home. Flavor of the carne asada tacos is outstanding.  I found it impossible to eat the tacos the way tacos should be eaten.  Both of the soft corn  kept falling apart before reaching my mouth.  So what I ended up eating was a pile of carne asada, broken up  tortillas with all the condiments and salsa, that required fork and spoon.  It was mid-morning Saturday and they were busy.  I will eat their food again because it tastes delicious but will phone in my order to go, in the future.
