4PqqRa7o_eNydKdGWYdIog I love a good taco. And horchata. And salsa. And this place has all three. 

We drove out here since I had to make some returns in Tempe, and I dragged my sister along promising tacos. This restaurant is a small, sit-down place with a cozy feel and cute decor. Workers are very nice and accommodating. We started off by ordering an horchata and chips and salsa, and both were fabulous which is how we knew we found a good food joint. Horchata is a little sweet but lacks nothing in flavor, as it also has a very nice creamy consistency. The salsa is my favorite though with a slight smoky undertone from the chiles used and medium heat level. They also have a salsa bar with the works back by the counter, and all of them were good, honestly.

Taco meat is usually smoked according to the menu, and my sister and I sampled almost all of them with the grilled fish and chicken being the favorite. I even added a grilled jalapeno to mine for an extra kick. 

Prices are very reasonable, and even though the tacos seem smaller, we left ready to explode after everything. This is definitely a place I wish was closer to my house but if you're in the area, hit 'em up for some awesome tacos!
