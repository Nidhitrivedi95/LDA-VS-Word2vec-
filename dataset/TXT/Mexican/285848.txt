YaFM08fEdbp-iSon3Opsbw Mexican food is my weekly, sometimes twice a week go-to dinner when I travel for work. Although the staff was very nice, they seemed hurried and frazzled. We ordered the double shrimp fajitas. The minimal (for two) shrimp were parboiled and sitting on top of overly abundant, over cooked and tasteless green and red peppers and onion. Even though the traditional plate came sizzling, the over all impression is bleh; no flavor AT ALL. Chips were stale, salsa came right out of a can, beans and rice.... bleh.
