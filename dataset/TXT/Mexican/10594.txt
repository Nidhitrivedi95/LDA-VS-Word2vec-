_XN-GwzZwAyIqLKJsl2htg Pretty disappointed. My fiancé and I have been here at least 5 times so this isn't a review just based on one bad experience. When SumoMaya first opened, we went and loved it so much that we brought his family for my birthday dinner. Then we brought our friends to try it. It was great! Then we went for lunch one day. Got chicharone guac, always good. The chips they serve with their guacamoles are awesome. I got Pad Thai, he got the chicken sandwich. My lunch was gross....no other way to describe it. Weird flavor a but figured maybe it wasn't for me. His sandwich was ok, fries were very good. The last time we went we brought my cousin and his fiancée. To be honest it was almost embarrassing. The only consistent thing here anymore is the guacamole. All the dishes we'd had previously that were amazing just came out "eh". Under seasoned, not fresh....super disappointing. I wish they could have kept up what they started with, at this point I'm not interested in ever going back. Not a cheap risk to take.
