QUdJyyDDieR_kdrCU9dPFA I enjoyed the naked burrito, which is basically a "build it yourself"burrito in a dish, a large dish. Mine started out with cilantro rice chorizo and grilled chicken. This was the first time ever that a restaurant offered cabbage instead of lettuce. Loved it. I also selected three or four sides but they have a large selection from which to choose. I went for mild. The Jarritos lime soda to wash it down was tasty too. My meal was huge for me and only cost $6.00 greenbacks and some change.
