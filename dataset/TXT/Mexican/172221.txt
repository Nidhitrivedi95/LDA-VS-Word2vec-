mB_cI1tCrNxxvr2e2myNrQ This place is pretty much just your average Taco Bell on the strip. The only biggest difference is they serve their typical Taco Bell slushies with alcohol. You can mix and match the slushies and comes with your choice of hard liquor (tequila, whiskey, vodka, rum). According to the server, mixed in whiskey is gross, vodka and rum if you don't want to taste the alcohol, and tequila if you want a good kick to it (although this just made it taste like a margarita). I know they also have additional items on the menu but it's your typical Taco Bell type bar food, nothing extraordinary.  It's a two story building with seating up top as well as a small shaded patio out front. I guess the cool thing is that you can pick up Taco Bell merchandise here (i.e. shot glasses, shirts, hats).

Probably a place to check out only once if you're a Taco Bell fan.
