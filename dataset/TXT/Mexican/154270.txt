The place feels like a New York restaurant.  Great ambiance.

Started with the grilled street corn, which they were nice enough to take off of the cob.  Was decent.  Could've been more spicy (although my order may have gotten mixed up with another diner who wanted less heat).  Had the duck confit for my main which was delicious.  We order the guac for the table.  Full disclosure, I didn't taste it, but it received a resounding "meh".  The salsa on the table was decent but nothing to write home about.

As for the drinks, I see others saying that they were watered down, which I have to agree with.  I had the smokehouse margarita which was not bad and the cilantro margarita which I couldn't taste.  

Overall decent dining experience (waiter was very attentive and helpful).  I'd give it another shot.
