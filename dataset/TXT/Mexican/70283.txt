BWsCjBVMR289vtojIz-gWw Food is amazing but customer service is the worst I've ever seen. They mess up and are rude every time I go. Once I ordered to go and they told me 20 min. I go 20 min later and they said it never got made and asked me what I got again. They made both orders wrong and when I told them they had it wrong the girl rolled her eyes and remade it very slowly. I recommend the one on greenfield and Williams field. Food is put together better and everyone there is awesome. Really upset I don't live next to that one anymore.
