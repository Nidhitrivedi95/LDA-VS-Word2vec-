7JQ5SNrrlCfkghYFzhOVUw Went to lunch here on Tuesday afternoon. Had very pleasant and friendly service and the food was great! Absolutely loved the lunch chimi and the salsa and chips were tasty as well. Definitely recommend trying this little hole in the wall out! Only reason for the 4 start review instead of 5 was the that the place itself seemed a little run down. Need to do a lot of updating/cleaning.
