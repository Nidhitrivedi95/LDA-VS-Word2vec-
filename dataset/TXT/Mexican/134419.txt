iikAHVLZrZn7Zy1aEPD25A Oh, hey Chipotle. 

Thanks for breaking my heart with this $8.50 chicken and steak burrito the size of my hand. Normally, I wouldn't care much, but this has happened on more than one occasion. 

For those curious it's supposed to be:

Double rice
Chicken
Steak
Cheese

Looks like I'll have to drive over to the Location closer to Mill.
