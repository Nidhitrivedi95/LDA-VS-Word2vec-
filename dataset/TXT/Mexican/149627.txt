jsuUmIEefPjV__ads62Z5w Mixed feelings here. I like the outside looking in blackout, but it is super dark inside. The food was bland. I got the Santa Fe chicken, and was thinking of horseradish sauce instead of hollandaise sauce, but the bar tender's excuse for not having a kick to the sauce was the jalapeños are not as hot in the summer. WRONG! The hotter and dryer the hotter the pepper. No big deal right? Well the bar tender became a d.bag after I asked for more sauce, more than he already was for having a man-bun. I believe his name was Tag, but just asking for more sauce is no reason to act like that. He also said cheers; come-on bro, you're not British. He also gossiped with a female employee for over 5 min, when I waiting to cash out. In many ways the Service was slightly above average as a whole. I was going to give an extra star for seeing them clean a vent hood, till I saw someone's food on the grill right below it. The place did not have a Mexican taste at all.
