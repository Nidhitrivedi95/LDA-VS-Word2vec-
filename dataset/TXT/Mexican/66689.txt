Bf2fuqWbHd3L-X69FSMvmg This place is phenomenal and the owners is super friendly.  I ordered the quesadilla stuffed with chorizo. Hot dammn! Amazing. Also had a few fish tacos. Thoroughly delicious and seasoned as well. The prices are very reasonable given the quality of the food.  When I went here it seemed like there were alot of spanish-speaking people sitting around chewing on stuff when I went in there, and that tells me that this would be an authentic experience for my tastebuds.  My hunch was right.  The Mexican football game was playing on the TV screens throughout dinner and a few times I heard "GOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!" which was pretty cool.  Overall, you'll get a hugely Mexican vibe being in here, amazing taste and flavours (could not find a single negative, not one), and very chill and accommodating service.  Will be back to try every single thing on that menu.
