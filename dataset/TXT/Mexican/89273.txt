dQwjYLmQXb06CpMPIpm5-g Since this Mexican restaurant is pretty close to where my boyfriend lives, I was pretty excited to try it. I ordered a Potato Chimichanga and it was fantastic and exactly what I would have wanted. While I would have loved for the chips to have been warmer for the salsa, what I just can't get over is how bad the margaritas were. I'm a huge marg lover and was so disappointed in how they looked (a weird shade of green) and tasted (almost like they were made with limeade).
