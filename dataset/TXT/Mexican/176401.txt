MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA Honestly the best tacos I have ever eaten. I am officially spoiled AND biased now :). I rate them in this order: Fish, Cauliflower, Chicken and then Beef. Also try the Jesus Juice!

As for the restaurant, it's a bit small and the music is very loud but the taste of the food and consistent quality is worth it. If you see a Special you like, order it. I've gotten them twice and haven't been disappointed. 

Overall, enjoyable and delish!
