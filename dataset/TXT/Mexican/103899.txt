fbQaKW0Lte0JQ_opbnjdKg I didn't understand all the hype to this place. I like that it's set up Chipotle style so you get to pick all your toppings. I just didn't think the enchiladas were that great. When I asked for the green salsa, they pretty much drowned it in it so that was all I tasted. The meat (I had chicken and green chile pork) was ok in flavor. It was a decent place but I don't see myself returning.
