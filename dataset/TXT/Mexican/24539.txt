2XkVexeY_8zyc9nriSElQg I am a new and big fan of Taco Tijuana! I just happened to drive by and decide to go in and I was not disappointed. I tried to the adobada and carne asada. So good. And the green salsa crema type stuff on there was excellent. I highly recommend and plan to go back many many times.
