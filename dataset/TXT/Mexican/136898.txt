IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA We had lunch during our staycation and a few drinks. Ceviche was tasty but the fish tacos were a bit off. The fish was dry and quite fishy. My Bloody Mary was bland and my husband's michelada was as well. I had been waiting to try the food here for quite some time and wished it were better. 
That being said, the service was great! All the staff were friendly and helpful and brought out some tasty hot sauce options to burn our mouths just as we requested. We will probably revisit on our next in-town vacation and try something different. The brunch looked delicious.
