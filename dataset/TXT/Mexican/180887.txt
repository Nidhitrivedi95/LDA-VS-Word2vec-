NAkuhaIe02ucJ34_BNvXYw The food is very good and the prices are great. I travel to Mexico a lot, so I asked the staff to make it Mexican spicy and they did. The staff is great and give great service. The tortilla soup is excellent and makes a meal for less than $5. They have beer special on Dos X.  The naked burrito is excellent. My only complain is they don't have chicken alambre dish.
