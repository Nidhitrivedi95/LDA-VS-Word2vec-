V2yFOyq-4cj7dUvEXyMiGQ Went two weeks ago for rolled tacos and a burrito take out.  Got home in less than 5 minutes and found the rolled tacos to be cold and super skimpy on the cheese and guacamole.  Burrito was just OK without a lot of flavor for a carne asada.  Went back last night.  Ordered 2 chicken tacos, 2 beef tacos and 3 rolled tacos.  Asked for the chicken tacos without lettuce but they still put it on.  Again, for take out.  From their front door to my house is not more than 1 light and a few minutes.  Again, the chicken tacos were cold. The beef tacos had so much oil on them the filling slipped out of the taco.  Did enjoy the rolled tacos as they had put a nice amount of cheese and guacamole.  Only problem was the cheese never melted.  This was the closest taco shop to me but I will not be going back again.
