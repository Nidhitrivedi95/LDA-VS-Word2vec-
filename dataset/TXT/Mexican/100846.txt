ETkMAKj_i2zGUXB8-iwZ6Q I've been to quite a few Moes locations - downtown Charlotte, Huntersville, and the now closed Ayrsley location and this one is just as good as the rest. My only issue with it is how small the location is vs, how many people come in. It can feel rather stuffy in there, BUT the food is amazing.

If you are reading this and you want to eat my order that I always get (and I've never been disappointed in it), order the following:::: 
Chicken burrito
No beans
Yes to the rice
Queso on top (I know it costs more)
A little bit of pico de gallo (too much::: too spicy)
Cilantro
Tomato 
Cucumber 


And that's it... Sometimes I'll get guac on the side, but yeah..it's good. Oh and I love squeezing lemon on top of my chips... Try it, sooooo good.
