rXUZNVlpWMV5ORDDSguOEQ Tried La Unica last night and was pretty impressed.

We were greeted and seated quickly and within minutes had ice cold beers with iced glasses to boot.  As mentioned, they offer a couple of salsas.  Keying on Joseph's suggestion, we asked for guacamole which was excellent.. some of the freshest I have had in Charlotte. The food was delivered quickly and was perfect.  The portions are large and everything was very fresh.  Our large entrees were both under $10.

We'll be back.
