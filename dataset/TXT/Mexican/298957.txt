zjvnqTjBp56NhMp1GrlO5g What a great place! Came here without knowing what to expect because a local friend invited us for brunch. Being tourists in LV, we would never have come here, because it's off the beaten tourist paths - thank god, we had our "local guide" and got the chance to discover this nice place with awesome food and friendly (and attractive!) service.
