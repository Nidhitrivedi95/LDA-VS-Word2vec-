tXqaK0lBEE1XJbzDPsdFvg 3 of us staying at fairfield inn las vegas south it was a quick easy ride over to farmers.  We ordered two yelp special combos and a sunday special club sand, which was like getting two because it was on chiabatta and each of my grown daughter and I ate half. It was good. I really liked how with combos you choose your side from fries, zuccini, green salad, or onion rings.  I had salad and it was a,good choice and their ranch dressing was tasty.  They also had little cups of jalapenos which I put in my sand.  They had those yellow peppers too. They are next to the soda machine   I was so excited they had cherry coke in the sodas.  Yes coke products!!!  Service was quick and the food was good and you order at the counter so no tipping needed.  I would gladly go back again.  They serve breakfast anytime.   Yummy!
