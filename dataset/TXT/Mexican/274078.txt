X57f6FWZiwI1wOidPPhOrQ Salsa with the beginnings of a kick and waiters who actualmente habla espanol does NOT an 'authentic' Mexican restaurant make.  Now I know I'm from San Diego most recently and Los Angeles before that, so I might be a bit more predisposed toward better Mexican food, but this isn't it.

THe Chicken Milanesa was....meh.  The overall atmosphere was ....also meh.

So far, my search for good Mexican food continues in C-U.
