S3-JpB5dBhMXmauMqeoN-g Great authentic Mexican food.  Small place but worth the wait if there is one. Tried the burrito, tacos and enchilada. All excellent.  The chicken was juicy and flavorful. Then enchilada was crispy. The way it should be. Both salsas were excellent. Just wish there were margaritas,  but i understand....laws.
