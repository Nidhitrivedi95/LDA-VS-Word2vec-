ms7cmWkPiSBDTnz-1sv2kQ Decent sangria (tried the passion fruit) and blue corn enchiladas.  The shrimp ceviche is not worth it - you've been warned.  We also got the coconut curry with chicken and pork chile verde mac and cheese.  The curry was okay, but left me wanting more heat and flavor.  Its one of those dishes that actually tastes better the next day after a quick zap in the microwave.  The pork chile verde mac and cheese sounds amazing in concept, but in reality, its just meh.

The patio is nice, so sit out there for dinner if you decide to check this place out.

I'll be back one more time since I have another groupon to use up, and I think it'll go towards sangria and dessert.
