-1VaIJza42Hjev6ukacCNg Excellent food!!!  It had been a bit since I had been to rio but we had a coupon from a local fundraiser.  Chips were warm and fresh, had the Rico special with beef and hubby had the pollo especial.   Both were excellent but I will do chicken in the rio next time.   We will definitely be back.
