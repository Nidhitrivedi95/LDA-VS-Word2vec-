Yqex0_J9DqqWjMVqjzB3Vg My husband and I are always on the hunt for new places to try and we stumbled upon this tiny taco place that's 5 minutes from our new place! We were in the mood for legit tacos so we tried out Taco Express.

Oh my, we are in love!

Our favorite has got to be their sweet pork tacos and tamales. I could eat them all day long if I could. The only thing is I wish the tacos weren't $1.99 each but about 99¢ each. $2 for a single taco is a bit pricey in my opinion. Other than that, it's delicious!
