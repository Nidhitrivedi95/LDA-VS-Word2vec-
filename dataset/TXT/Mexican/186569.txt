NYTe202AJmEynCj4STfRow This place only gets 2 stars for cleanliness. Service was non existent, so was flavor.  The prices were outrageous and the 'mexican' food was mediocre at the very least.  Their salsa was canned tomato sauce, no flavor whatsoever. I cook better at home.  The fact that we spent $43 and chips were extra is just ridiculous.  If you want really good 'fast' Mexican, go to senior taco.  Even their waitstaff had attitude.  Too bad, because they are so close to my house.  Just very disappointed:(
