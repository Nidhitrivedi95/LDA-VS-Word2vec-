XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg I've been here twice and both times, the food was wonderful. I was actually surprised at their portions because for a trendy-ish, celebrity chef run restaurant the sizes are pretty small and ridiculousy expensive. but it wasn't frou-frou at all, our waiter was great and can't wait to eat there again!
