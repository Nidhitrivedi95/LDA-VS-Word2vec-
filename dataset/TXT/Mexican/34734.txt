5-_4mHujcNo0PWj3-ybwnQ Pass by this taco place to drive my son to school. Always tempted by the 75 cent Tuesday taco sign. Finally had a chance to try it. Great tacos. Red salsa that they have in ketchup bottles on the counter is SUPER spicy and reminiscent of King Taco/El Taurino in LA. Al pastor tacos were juicier than asado. Overall great value and great taste. Will be back!
