u5KyjlgT5gt8cpItNwGA6g So I've been looking to go to different small mom and pop restaurants. This one is pretty good. 
My son ordered pancakes and bacon. Huge pancakes plus they were delicious. 
My wife and I both ordered omelets. Mine with grits and hers with hash browns. The grits weren't good. I had to add a lot of salt. Her hash browns came out hard and a little over cooked, but they replaced them with another order. They were pretty good when it was cooked right. The omelets were pretty good and they had a big portion of me inside of them.
The best part of the visit was the sweet tea. The tea is delicious. It is a must have
