15yP8OOhUcESzYbLcm6s3g Went this morning for brunch. I had a cheese tamal and a al pastor burrito. The food was ok. We are from Guadalajara so we expected more from this restaurant after reading all the good reviews. 
The tamales had too much masa and my al pastor burrito was too salty. My husband had the chile verde pork burrito and he threw it up about 30 minutes after eating. 

The ambiance is nice and they have nice decor. I don't think we'll go back though.
