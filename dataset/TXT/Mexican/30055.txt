46hnat0aLao-qYWZkN9aBg What a great place!  Definitely did not disappoint! The decor is quirky and clean. All of the staff that helped us was friendly and knowledgable. Service was very fast too, especially for a Saturday night!  We had the Carne Adovada Chimichanga and the Victoria's Chicken Chile plate (green chile) with the Spicy Beans (not on the menu), and a side of sour cream.  Everything was delicious.  The green chile sauce was very spicy, but had a great taste.  Not just spicy to say it is spicy.  Truly delicious!  Both the chicken and the pork were juicy and cooked to perfection.  As mentioned in other reviews, the sour cream was a perfect touch to help manage the heat levels.  Topped dinner off with a pitcher of the fresh margaritas and 1800 tequila...  Perfect compliment.  Can't wait to come back to this place on our next trip!!!
