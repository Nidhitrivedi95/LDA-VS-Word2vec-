YQFcxE9UXrKc-QuTUu7twQ Came here for brunch on a Saturday morning because everywhere else had super crazy wait times! Overall, it wasn't a bad experience. Food wasn't terrible, but I wasn't blown away by it either. We had a group and got 2 mimosa buckets which were nice! They came with a variety of juices to choose from. Our waitress was great! Even though this wasn't the best Mexican food I've ever had, I'd definitely go back to try out lunch/dinner and see how their ritas are!
