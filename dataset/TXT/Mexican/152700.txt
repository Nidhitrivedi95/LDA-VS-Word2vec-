JZKefaX9VXvmkcfMmbyrEg Ok I miss Burrito Bandido. They have the recipes from BB. It's *almost* the same. I go here when I have a desperate craving. However, no diet soda, only tea, weird. Meh. Looks like a struggling location. Since it is a Bertos, they are locked into their menu style. My fave is the Baby Bandidos, I mean the mini chimis. It'll do. Party like its 1999!
