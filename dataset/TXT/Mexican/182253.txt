nHdsHdq35JflGzliWVqG-Q I am from southern California and have been eating Mexican food my whole life. A coworker suggested I try the place as I had only 10 min to grab lunch. I was apprehensive as us Californians are used to amazing Mexican food. I went in and was immediately greeted by the owner. He stated that he had been to California prior to setting up the restaurant to research and master the cuisine. I got a regular burrito with spicy pork, black beans, rice, and lots of yummy toppings. They had the best spicy pork I have had and also a large variety of other meats cut just like in Mexico! They also had hundreds of hot sauces, fresh cut jalapenos, a staff that seemed very happy and helpful, and shared that they have home made tamales on Tuesday and Friday. Yummmmmmmm! They also give you chiclets gum in the bag when you leave!! Just like Mexicoooo! I am very impressed by this restaurant and will go back for sureeeeeeeee! Thanks for a great meal!
