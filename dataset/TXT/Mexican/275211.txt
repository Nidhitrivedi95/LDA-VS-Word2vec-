XcOy_IMkPO9jGBox6mHT8w This place is an excellent value. I'm also spoiled by their salsa.

I like to cook for myself, but sometimes I'm too busy or tired or whatever. I can go here and get a meal that will absolutely satisfy me for right around $10. That easily beats pizza delivery price, for example. 

My favorites: 

Nachos
Torta Ahogada
Papas Lokas (carne asada fries)
Quesadilla combo

flan dessert

They also offer different meats so if you want carnitas or lengue tacos they have that, you can also get a goat combo/soup on weekends.

They've remodeled a few times and the place is looking nicer than ever.
