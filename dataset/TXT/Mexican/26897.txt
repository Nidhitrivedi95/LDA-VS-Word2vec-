3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ Looking for taco heaven? Your prayers are answered here.  Outstanding tacos and other delicacies with the only problem being there are so many great choices, you'll be full before you can try too many. The street corn is a must-try.  It's on the cob and on the mark for best side dish ever.  The tacos are nice and hearty, so two should suffice unless you're super hungry.    

It's almost impossible to do, but save room for dessert. The Coconut Cream pie is outstanding.  The Prickly Pear sorbet was also refreshing and had great flavor - not overly sweet.  

The atmosphere is beyond hip and cool - it's an old repurposed church.  The service is fast, friendly and efficient.  Prices are reasonable too - Hallelujah! I've found a church I'll frequent.
