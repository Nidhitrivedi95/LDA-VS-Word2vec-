Ps5kdt-BC9zahJasErkd5Q Here's my burrito bowl: 
Cold cumpy bland rice 
COLD, chewy steak
Not even enough food to cover the bottom of my bowl.

Service is rude.
Asked for a cup of extra rice, gave me a side queso dip. Asked AGAIN for rice and they poured me a bigger cup of queso dip. 
THEY had the nerve to get annoyed with me. 
But how to you confuse rice for queso? 

Worst Chipotle location I've ever been to
