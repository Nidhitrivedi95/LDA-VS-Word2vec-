qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A Had been wanting to go here for 5 or 6 years. Live right around the corner. Finally made it after my girl and I decided to have some brunch for my (-?-) birthday. Didn't want to miss the original before they moved. 

Sat on the patio on a delightful Sunday morning. Great ambiance but could've used a little music to set the tone. Very relaxing nonetheless. 

Started with the taquitos and a cold hefe. Then got the blueberry and white chocolate scones. As well as the chilaquiles. Scones were a great portion as well as light and fluffy. The chilaquiles were a little small but so delicious. We're definitely excited to check out the new spot and will be sure to try other options.
