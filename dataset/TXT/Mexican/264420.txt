Wc9UpJhOcdSj7olZkz7SJA This place is a phoenix hidden gem! The banana milk shakes are absolutely amazing! The standard burger is authentic as a burger comes! Mouth watering meaty burgers on a crispy toasty soft moist bunn. With  pickles. The street corn has a delicious variety of spices on a white ear. It came on a stick in a cup! Vintage building in a historic part of phoenix, awsome people. I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys in n out because the Stand is simply 10× better! Thank you for the memorable experience I will be returning with hungry friends!
