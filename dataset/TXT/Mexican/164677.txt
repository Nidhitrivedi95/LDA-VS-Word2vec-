LLWOrt8Vo5kyA9qeo-Y76g We have been coming for Moreno's for years!

For delicious authentic Mexican food for a good price come eat here.

My favorite is the Tejano burrito with beef. It has a mild spice to it since there is a green chile with cheese in it that has so much flavor. 

Can't go wrong with any of the dishes.
