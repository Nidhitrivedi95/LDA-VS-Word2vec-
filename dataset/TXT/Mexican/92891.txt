e2ApirIzYID9xIye0r_gKQ The menu looked great. They have some unique items that looked really good. The ambiance is in between a restaurant and a fast food place. The price's are pretty good as well.The problems began after we ordered. It took exceptionaally long to get our food, and the place was by no means crowded. When the food finally arrived, it was cold. This is a 3 star place on it's best day. Long wait and cold food..gotta give them a 2.
