NYTe202AJmEynCj4STfRow Definitely my favorite restaurant! I started eating their shrimp tacos 30 years ago, and I've never turned back. Amazing marinated and roasted meats, grilled seafood, and fresh salsas. Even their refried beans have a special smoky flavor. It's a casual taqueria where you order at the counter. Service is fast and friendly.
