cbbidA4huw2XQQWlmbUQgw This is Great Place' to hold a celebration dinner. They have Mariachi music on Friday's at 8pm, our celebration party was well entertained by the quality of Mariachi musicianship and that they sang every song request from our party guests. The food was very good along with the requested cocktails from the bar- no complaints here! Oh I forgot to mention the celebration dinner will also come with free event planning assistance, thanks Grace ' for the shock and Awe surprise birthday party planning ideas for my wife's 50th birthday it was a fun time thanks again-
