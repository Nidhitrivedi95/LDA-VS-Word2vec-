FxEJjLZj6UdsOCGcgEufeA I had my first visit here on the way home from work off of the 51 & Indian school as I was desperately searching for a bakery. Since this place is in a predominantly Hispanic area, I was a little apprehensive to visit as sometimes people can treat you a little differently if you don't speak Spanish (I am Mexican & Japanese but all gringa on the inside). 

 When I entered, I was greeted in English by a very nice lady struggling with replacing the paper in the cash register. She finished up and proceeded to help explain all of the goodies and different types of Conchas behind the counter. I ended up getting a dozen fresh tortillas, 4 sweet breads and 2 Empanadas for only $7.75. 

 I managed to devour one of the sweet breads on the way home and  was NOT disappointed. It was light and airy with notes of vanilla and by far the freshest I ever had. I will absolutely be back to this bakery and am eager to also try their tamales one day. If you don't mind the neighborhood, be sure to stop by, you won't regret it!
