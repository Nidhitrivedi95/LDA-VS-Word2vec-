Y92gs-2nwUuioEdtkrOfdw We went here specifically because people were raving about the breakfast burritos and we're totally underwhelmed. These were the skimpiest breakfast burritos. Potatoes were add ons. WTH, potatoes or hash browns & eggs are what makes a breakfast burrito. Check out my pics of a ham, egg & cheese but they forgot the pico de gallo & the sausage burrito with potatoes added didn't have any potatoes or pico de gallo. I guess we caught them on a bad day or right when they opened or something.
