zCmwErM82hdKl4L2UixDJw Always my favorite place. While I enjoy the atmosphere at Tremont a bit more, the food is equally as good at Lakewood, and the ambiance is still great! Their salsa is one of my favorites. Pineapple guacamole is a must. I've had a million Margs/tequila drinks here, always well-made (Pear's my personal fave). You can't go wrong with any of the taco options. I've made at least 25 diff combos - all were good. Chorizo in a green goddess w/cilantro/onions, chihuahua, salsa verde, and cilantro lime aioli & pulled pork in a white widow w/jicama slaw, smoked cheddar, pineapple salsa, chipotle crema, and habanero mango BBQ today. Both good. ALWAYS good. Best. Place. Ever.
