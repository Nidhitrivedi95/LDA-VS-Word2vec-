We opted for sharing the cheesesteak burger and the carne asada fries. Surprisingly, the food traveled well and was still warm when we got it home (which was not exactly close).

The carne asada fries were seriously delicious. I. Could. Not. Stop. Eating. Them. So tasty! And they definitely don't skimp on the toppings here. You couldn't even see the fries for all the toppings. The meat was perfect - tender and full of tastiness.

The cheesesteak burger was good, but it didn't blow me away. I loved all the toppings and that it did, in fact, kinda taste like a cheesesteak. It was a neat and different way to enjoy a burger. The burger could've been a little less cooked and little better seasoned. But it was yummy enough. Good quality ingredients.

We will most definitely be coming back and trying more burgers and fries. TIP: We were informed that they have Instagram account which features some of their "secret menu" options.
