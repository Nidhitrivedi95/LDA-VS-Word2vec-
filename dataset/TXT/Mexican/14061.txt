I got the carne asada fries without jalapeños and before I fully took a bite, I already knew it would be good. When I actually took the bite, it was just good, but delicious! I wholeheartedly believe that it's better than Roberto's!! 

I had bought Buffalo sauce to add to it because I had tried it that way while at Papas and Beer in Ensenada and loved it. I didn't need it for the fries from here but I added a little and it only made it better! 

Customer service was great, food was great, I definitely will return to this restaurant for their food.
