cr84hpeFeas6N6VGV7Iu3A I don't think this is quite Mexican. The dishes are there, but there's something not right. No refried beans, the guacamole had hardly any avocados in it. They have Dominican specialties on their menu and things like fries that aren't typically at mexican restaurants, so possibly they specialize in that and not Mexican. The service was ok but nothing great. It was a busy night, though. We won't be returning. Too many restaurants out there to try to return to a blah place.
