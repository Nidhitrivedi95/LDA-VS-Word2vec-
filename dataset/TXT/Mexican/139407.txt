j0pppFcCeTnmBduZ30gGiA Bad service, rude staff. 

Came in 10:55, everything was ready to serve but the rude waitress said "we open in 5 mins" and turned back" 
Ok, I walked out and did some shopping and came back around 11:30 and same waitress who served my salad, completely rude like I owed her 100 bucks. This is the worst cafe rio locations I have ever been to in terms of service and work ethics. They deserve a 0 star if that is one to be given. No wonder they get this crappy review overall. 

Shame on you sucka, if you do not to know how to be a good server, then do not work!
