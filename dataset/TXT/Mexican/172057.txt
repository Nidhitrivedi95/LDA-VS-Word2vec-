MAuSh7NKoT__CQ4BumoayA Ate here last night. Food was really good. I'm from Texas and expect refried beans or charro beans with my meal and I'm finding that no where in Nevada offers that. They do give you black beans which are almost as good. Pricey, $22 for a chicken fajita plate for one. Service wasn't that great. Our server wasn't very attentive which is why I'm giving 4 stars. I would recommend this restaurant. If you're walking around the casinos and happen to have a drink, make sure you finish it because no outside food or beverages is allowed inside.
