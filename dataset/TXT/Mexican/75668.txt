CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q This taco spot is OVER rated , its the only REAL mexican taco spot on the strip so i get why , the food is good but not the best ! My experience here WAS COMPLETELY HORRIBLE that security  of yours was being RUDE to everyone who was trying to find a table INCLUDING ME she made a scene being loud and obnoxious when not needed she was VERY UNPROFESSIONAL and threatened to  go "86 on yo ass" to a customer who was simply trying to walk in the gate and be seated IS THAT A THREAT???  And when the whole scene was over she was STILL talking about the problem to OTHER CUSTOMERS GET RID OF YOUR SECURITY!!!!!!! She ruined my dinner and couldnt even enjoy my food !!!
