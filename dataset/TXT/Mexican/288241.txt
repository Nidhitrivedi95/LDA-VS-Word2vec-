Yevhl8bTwdJuu_LWKv-4Fw Just went for the first time today! Since I went at 1:30PM I ordered from the lunch specials. I ended up picking the EL CUBANO & SOUP OR SALAD, which I chose to have chicken tortilla soup.

Food was tasty! I don't typically go for/have minimal experience eating Latin flavors but it was impressive. I did end up having a hair in my soup, which was slightly gross because I already had eaten half of it. I'm not really one to keep quiet when there is hair in my food (especially when it isn't mine). They were so nice about it though, and took my meal off the bill. I think it really says a lot about a restaurant when they don't charge you for their mistake rather than try and fix it by giving you a new plate of food.
