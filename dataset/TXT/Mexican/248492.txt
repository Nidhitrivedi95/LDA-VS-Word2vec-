U9iNEzBVCsPLrzoJOwa32Q I've been to plenty of Qdoba's and this is hands down on the bottom of the list. The manager on day shift is very rude. Rest of the staff seems highly uninterested in being there. My work "lunch buddy" and I always used to eat at Qdoba before we changed locations, we tried eating her several times and just got tired of the manager and staff attitude. Won't be going back.
