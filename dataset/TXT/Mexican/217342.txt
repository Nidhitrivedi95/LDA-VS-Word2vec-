Service was good, but because we used the Yelp $30 for $15 deal and had a party of 7, that somehow justified an automatic gratuity charge of 20% (despite the menu statement of automatic gratuity for only parties of 8 or more). We were told to talk to the manager but didn't want to deal w the hassle. Not sure if using the Yelp deal automatically leads to included gratuity, so may be good to ask before buying it.
