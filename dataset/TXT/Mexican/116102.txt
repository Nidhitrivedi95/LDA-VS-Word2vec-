GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog First off: Kudos to my server, Kevin (with the groovy mustache). He's the perfect combination of professional and friendly. It's good to feel taken-care-of, and this makes me want to return. This is service at a level that I would expect at a high-end "fine dining" restaurant. (Five stars for Kevin).

As for the food - I only had a couple of tacos, but they were *fantastic*! I plan on returning to eat my weight in Tacos Napoles y Queso. Seriously. These little unassuming tacos are some of the best things that I've eaten on the Strip. Somehow, they've managed to capture the essence of campfire smoke and infuse it into the cheese - making this an amazing and delicious treat for those who love smokey flavors (like me). 

The only downer? Price.
Granted; it is not ridiculous for The Strip, and from what I can tell, the food quality is very high. But living as we do in what must be the Inexpensive Mexican Food capital of the U.S., I still have trouble paying over $20 (with tip) for two tacos and a small coke - no matter how fancy. 

So, I'll start saving now for my upcoming taco bender - but this will have to be a rare treat, rather than a regular thing.
