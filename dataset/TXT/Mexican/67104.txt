BgQ5ob0QiZfO5YbgI7VyFw We could eat every meal here! The Carne Adovada is to die for, chile relleno is really flavorful, margaritas are delish, and the delicately crispy chips and yummy salsa are soooo good. We are from San Diego and just visiting but so glad we found this place. We couldn't even finish our 2 item orders as the portions were quite large. Don't miss this place!
