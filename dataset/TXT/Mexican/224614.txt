I think we came on a Friday at bout 7 and this place was slammed with a lot of authentic looking people so I'm guessing it was legit. There are various ordering lines that my group was clueless too even though they had signs. They had both English and Spanish but still confusing. We definitely ordered in the wrong line and the employee was annoyed with us. 

On to the food, we got a couple carne tacos and I think accidentally got shoulder or tongue. The texture was weird on that one, but the flavors were great. Tacos are about $2.5 each or so and guys you'll prolly need 3 at least.

Ok on to my favorite part of the meal, the carne asada fries (forget what they are called on the menu, but doesn't say fries I don't think). Also, on the menu board I think it says $13, but I don't think it's clear because we were giving a 1/2 order but it was $8 I think. The 1/2 order can be shared by two people, it's a lot of food. Tons of cheese, guacamole, and sour cream or something gooey. Plenty of meat on it as well.

The big negative here is that there is no seating and the strip mall seems a little suspect. But if you want tacos and carne asada fries give it a shot.
