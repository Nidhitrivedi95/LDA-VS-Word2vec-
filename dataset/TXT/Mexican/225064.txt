RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg Came here around 530pm and wasn't expecting a huge line. It can get so busy that you wait outside the store. No worries as security let's you in accordingly. There are different lines for the meats so one person gets the adobada (2) which is flavorful and you should get this. It didn't knock my socks off but still good. Carne also not as delicious and sorta dry but still ok. We got two but I could have split 1 since we split small size of carne asada fries. Fries are crunchy so be sure to get. Half order is still lots of food for two but for any bigger group, get the large.
