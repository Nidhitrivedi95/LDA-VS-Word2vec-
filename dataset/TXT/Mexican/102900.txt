F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw I wish I was able to review the food here, but we were unable to eat.  We arrived at 5:05 and the place was well occupied for a Tuesday.  This should be a sign of quality.  But, we stood by the door for nearly 15 minutes before we could get anyone's attention.  When we did catch her eye, she just gently tossed a couple menus our way and carried on with her business. It took another ten minutes before we could ask what happy hour was, since the menu has the hours, but does nothing to signify what the deals were.  Obviously irritated we would have the audacity to ask a question, she was a bit terse.  Since it was happy hour, and half the tables were occupied and half were reserved, we excused ourselves to what ended up being a much better happy hour elsewhere.

In the server's defense working the patio, he was apologetic when inquiring why we were leaving.  He wanted to know if we wanted him to inquire about the wait inside, and we said no thank you, as we had already wasted over 35 minutes of our "happy" time.

Not sure if we will give them another chance to take our money, or not.  We have had plenty of quality experiences elsewhere.  We'll see...
