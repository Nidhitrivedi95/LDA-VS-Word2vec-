L2iT7pipc455Tgpbo35_mw The only reason I'm giving C.A.S.A 2 stars is because the outside patio is an awesome place to go hang out during the day - good food, good drinks, great staff.

At night (at least in the lounge) I will NEVER go back. I payed $6 for a margarita and it tasted like straight ass. You are a professional establishment...how do you mess up something as easy as a margarita? That shit was undrinkable. It somewhat resembled a combination of milk and orange juice. When I asked the bartender to taste it, he refused and just poured another shot into it and told me to quit complaining. Pouring more tequila in it is not going to make it taste better. I'm not one to complain but it really was that bad. Both myself and my friends that I was with ended up leaving pretty much our entire drinks.

Bottom line: you are a Mexican restaraunt and you still managed to fuck up something near and dear to my heart.
