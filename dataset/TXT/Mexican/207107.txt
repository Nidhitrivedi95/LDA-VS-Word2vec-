q6BiPGNf2ANWkwal9HPkQg My first grand visit was last night, pulled in and the place was packed. I asked the girl how long of a wait she said 2 mins!! A packed restaurant and a 2 min wait awesome,  got seated and then had to wait 15 mins for water haha that was alittle annoying but they were busy. Ordered the food which came out in a good amout of time, I got 3 tacos and rice it was good, a lot of yummy cheese on the tacos, good size although the meat could of been more flavorful, but still pretty good. Then we had to wait about 15 mins for the check haha. So overall food is good but waiting for stuff too long is annoying, I would go again if I have a taste for mexican and happen to b in sville.
