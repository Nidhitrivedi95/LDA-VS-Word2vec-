S28n7eAj393k3gUOia7dIg HORRIBLE SERVICE!  They give you what they want in the drive thru, and hope you won't come back.  I quit going to this Taco Bell a year ago, after they first opened, because the food was horrible!  My gf tells me they have a terrific tostada and I give it one more try.  My order was so screwed up!

I drove back to return the items I never ordered, and get my money back.  The manager was arrogant, uncooperative and hateful.  She wanted to argue with me over $3.  She should be fired!  No communication skills. 

NEVER AGAIN!!  Be aware.  The order may be or not be what you ordered, and if you return the foil wrapped, soggy food, the manager is going to argue with you.  Horrible experience . . . twice!!  Never again.

I live around the corner from this store.  It would be nice to have a fast food to depend upon.  Sadly, it's not this Taco Bell.  These people are idiots and couldn't fill an order correctly if they tried. Arrogant, hateful and  . . . how much sense does it take to fill an order correctly? . . .  a very unpleasant experience that required my driving back, walking into the shop and arguing with the lame manager over a screwed up order.  NEVER AGAIN!  Not this store.  They are idiots.

Don't waste your time.
