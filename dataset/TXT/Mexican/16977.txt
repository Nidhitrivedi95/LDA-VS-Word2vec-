1GXTRFzsANkhkRIivqMtuQ Great new place in downtown Chandler! Today was my third time in because the food is so good and a great indoor/outdoor set up. Everything I've tried so far has amazing and a cherry on top is they have the BEST ranch (I'm a total ranch connoisseur).  Service has been fantastic, I'd say it's a smooth running machine for only being open a few weeks. I see a lot of football games being watched here with all the TV's, indoor-outdoor feel, delicious food and great service.
