xw6G0T2VQZAtta6RcZoAOQ Came to this location for the first time in a while. Employees are nice and friendly. Food was good, besides the fact I saw one of the workers mix new beans in with the old beans instead of switching out the whole container (which is what is supposed to happen according to standards?) the old container was all crusty with old beans and looked like it hadn't been changed all day.. So yeah. As you would guess I didn't get beans . But I'm sure there's been worse. Other than that everything was ok.
