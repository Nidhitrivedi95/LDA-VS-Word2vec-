8ou6p7T-3KaNOhDeln3Ccg Best place for fresh, flavorful, inexpensive tacos. I've had the Baha tacos and the blackened shrimp tacos.
Both were excellent, the shrimp tacos were a little on the small side but still good. You get three tacos, chips and the help yourself salsa bar, which I love.
   My daughter had a burrito  that was so big I thought some would be going home, but she ate all of it and said it was very nice...
   We also had some guacamole and it was very good too, along with the fresh, warm chips.
  You have your standard soda fountain, some Mexican bottled sodas, an iced tea dispenser, an assortment of bottled beers, and Margaritas if your thirsty, and water, of course. 
 The place is very casual, you order from the counter and they bring it out to you. I've been there twice and didn't have a wait or see the dining area very crowded.
  I did see alot of take out, which makes sense because this place does what they do very well!
  My go to for tacos!
