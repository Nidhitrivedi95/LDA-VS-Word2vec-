By far one of the best Mexican restaurants in area!  Be sure to clear your calendar for Margarita Monday's, their Happy Hour it's fantastic!

The Downside:
The service is horrid!  We stopped in for Happy Hour at the bar and the bartender told us " I'm going on break go sit at a table"!  Needless to say we were shocked and after waiting15 mins for the hostess to try to clear us a table at 4:30pm we walked out.
