Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ The food and the service was as expected, PERFECT. We have a Javiers back home in Newport Coast and it taste just like it and has the same atmosphere. Love love love Javiers. The taquitos and the seafood enchiladas are delicious. I wish they had consome for their taquitos. Consome is the a broth, trust me the taquitos will taste better if you can dip them in a little hot broth. I am Mexican and don't like to eat at Mexican restaurants because it's never the same but this place is pretty good. Obviously not the same but one thing you guys need to know is that Mexican food is different depending on the state of Mexico. I am from Sinaloa :)
