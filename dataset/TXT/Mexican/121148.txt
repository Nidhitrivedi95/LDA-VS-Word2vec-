h4Q-uSoOIhMoIsOhat6l3A My husband and I have decided we will no longer visit this restaurant. We use to go here often since it's across the street from our house and we love Mexican food. We stopped going because they charged another parties dinner on our card and we noticed when we got home we had just paid $120 for two meals. We were given the run around all day trying to get the money reimbursed. They had a problem with it and it took up our whole day trying to get it resolved. Now, tonight I was craving a bean and cheese burrito with wet sauce and rice and beans on the side so I went and ordered that to go. When I got home, all I had was a wet bean and cheese burrito, no rice and beans. I was pretty upset since I just spent $14.05 for just a burrito and didn't get the full entree. My husband went back to the restaurant and they said that was correct, I had only ordered the "wet bean and cheese burrito". My husband said no, she spent $14.05 because it was suppose to be the entree. They proceeded to not agree and not fix the problem. My husband just said forget it and drove back home. That price is pretty outrageous for just a bean and cheese burrito with no meat but the main point is if the girl taking my order was actually paying attention, she would have heard that I wanted a wet burrito with rice and beans on the side. They don't care to make anything right with the customer when there's conflict. I work in customer service and if something is wrong, we do our best to fix it. This has happened to us twice and we will not be returning.
