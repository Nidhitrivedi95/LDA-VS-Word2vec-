muefnimyq_3KIdEouJFvrA My wife and I tried this place before a movie. I ordered the taco salad with chicken. It was HUGE but the chicken was cubed and NOT fresh at all. I ACTUALLY hurt my tooth on one piece. You can tell they make the batch early and then let it sit. Out food came in like 4 minutes.... So if fresh quality food matters to you. I would skip it. Now I have 3 stars because the waitress did handle it well. She got the manager and it was taken off our bill. They offered to replace but I just wanted popcorn at that moment. So I was happy with how they dealt with it. Maybe I got unlucky? I usually NEVER say anything because I get embarrassed. but this was gross. I am sad. I thought we found a new spot. We tipped the waitress based on the original bill since she did a good job fixing thing. Not her fault they cut corners on the kitchen.
