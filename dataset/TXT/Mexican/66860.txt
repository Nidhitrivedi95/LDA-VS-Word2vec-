Bf2fuqWbHd3L-X69FSMvmg Came here only because Seven Lives was closed for renovations and we were craving Mexican. 

I wouldn't say it's anything special here - typical and authentic, but nothing unique really to entice me for another visit. 

We got their special taco , something they were considering adding to the menu, but it wasn't as flavourful as the chicken tinga. 

There's lots of the menu, but I didn't find it anything special that blew me away.
