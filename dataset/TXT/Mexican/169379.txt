lWmDrnqgU6w3gFaJyn_1Uw Got there about noon on a Saturday and was disappointed that they had limited brunch menu since I was looking forward to the highly rated tapas.  The server was very friendly and patient while we tried to figure out what to eat.  Ordered a bunch of food and drinks.  None of it was outstanding, but the attitude was so good that I would be willing to try again at tapas time.  Good attitude triumphs mediocre food.
