N5CL5HLS6lyltw-OjjBrOw The Mandalay Place I believe has this exact restaurant & even though the happy hour all day Sunday is a great idea, friendly quick staff, the food is just ok.  Many other Mexican restaurants out there that are better.  The margarita was very sour.  Good spot for a large group, nice atmosphere for it & prices.  

Check-in for a free yummy Mexican corn so I'll be back now haha.  As long as I've been to a Hussongs Cantina, it's always just been so-so & convenient.  Happy Taco Tuesday & happy hour!
