OjnRf8yDGEBCoUDdchSViw I  went to food truck Friday and was faced with a number of options and ended up choosing Jumburrito based solely on their deep fried oyster poh boy.   The wait seemed to be on the long side so I asked how long and was told 7 to 11 minutes which proved to be about right.

For the price tag of 12 bucks I thought the serving size was small especially for the truck repping  Nola food.

The sandwich came on a grilled hot dog bun to give you all an idea of the size of the sandwich.

Grilled hot dog bun with plenty of butter, delicious fried oysters topped with cole slaw.

The sandwich was delicious and I was satisfied but would've liked to see the traditional toppings such add lettuce and tomatoes.  Other than the size and the price I enjoyed the sandwich.
