E_DXCeVllZtHV93hsAIZvw Coming from Washington State from a very Mexican culture and then living in LA for 10+ years, I had a very hard time finding authentic tacos in the East Valley (everything is very white washed per say)...until I found Tacos Sahuaro...OMG...BOMB...It's a little far to drive for me but worth it when I get that craving and am too lazy to make them myself.
