zwmps5SXn30g-f5wqg_r9A Let me start off by saying I LOVE your restaurant. It use to be a tradition to go to your Peoria location every Sunday night after dinner with my family and friends. We started noticing a pattern of rude service. We usually arrive around 9pm and the restaurant doesn't close til 10. It's like the waiters were annoyed that we were coming in. It has seriously been the last 5 or 6 times we visitied. We got the same 2 people a waiter and waitress and they were consistently rude. So over a period of time we've gone less. We usually decide to give it another chance and we're always disappointed. Tonight was so bad that we walked out before we were even seated. We arrived at 9 the restaurant was practically empty and we stood in the waiting area for 20 minutes waiting. A male waiter(one of the 2 rude ones) walked by where we were standing and looked at us. He walked back by us and said very loudly, "I don't want any more people, I'm tired." At that point we decided that's enough. Never have we felt like our business was unwanted. It was completely rude and uncalled for.
