IYpaW7h8aPYKIK84_ZKMIg We stopped by this new Mexican restaurant after seeing The King and I with a group of friends.  At 5:00 (it was a Saturday Matinee performance) we were near the first of the dinner crowd.  Margarita's were simply outstanding, with different people in our group choosing different flavors and preparations.  By the time the second round was ordered, our server pushed us to go toward a pitcher of their "better" version of the house, Paloma - good move!

We ordered dinners, the combination Fajitas were outstanding, a shrimp scallop special tasted great and everyone else at the table raved about their dinners of traditional Mexican fare.  Good chips and salsa along with great guacamole rounded out a full crowd.  Portions were simple, well spiced, good to eat, and nearly too much to finish.

The best part of the evening - our bill arrived and it was so reasonable!  Our $12 to $16 dinners along with all of the margaritas did not break the bank - a $17 pitcher of drinks went a long way.

Stop in when in the Playhouse square area - or make the walk from downtown - it is worth the effort!  Even with Bario down the street - this place makes a great meal (in my opinion better)and you can talk to your friends without shouting.  The restaurant was packed when we left - and did not even notice the change (or maybe that was the Tequila effect).

Enjoy!
