CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q Oh man! Tacos el Gordo it's a must for me and family to come to when in Vegas! The tacos the pastor are really good. The only down side it's the lines for every meat . If you come with a large group have someone get into a line and one getting a table . Finding a table is annoying is you have to stand and wait for someone to get up . So get one before ordering your tacos .
