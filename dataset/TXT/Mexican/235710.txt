They are a long way from my house, almost 40 miles round trip. Which is why we waited so long to try it. Nothing fancy or like interior authentic, just really good food and plenty of it.

The chips and salsas are tasty but the grilled onions and jalapenos take the whole amuse bouche (sorry don't know the Spanish term) to another level. The Sopa de Fideo reminds me of Texas in the 60s.

The shrimp ceviche was so fresh tasting and a huge portion. I will need to tweak the Margarita Martini a little to get it where it needs to be but they have Bohemia; absolutely the best Mexican beer by far and harder and harder to find Outwest.

My GF ordered the Chile Relleno. Now a short discourse on that dish; it should be made with a Poblano chile that has been roasted and peeled NOT deep fried and peeled. An Anaheim or long green is too mild and somewhat insipid tasting, deep frying leaves the pepper al dente. Even though picadillo is also traditional filling, I prefer cheese with a thick but fluffy batter. A light red sauce and some queso leaves you with a 9 out of 10 relleno!

I had the green chile burrito enchilada style (an homage to the Jungle Club/El Jardin) and a cheese enchilada (because I am from Texas). The enchilada sauce was darker than I usually like, a little bitter but really tasted homemade and the enchilada was great!

Rice and beans are well above average and the service was excellent. $60.00 for 3 beers, a $9.95 Margarita, a huge appetizer, and 2 combination plates. Living La Vida Loca!
