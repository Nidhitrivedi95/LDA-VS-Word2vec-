UANNbspNsQEFUay5nALZYw Since my husband and I moved here to Vegas from NY, we were craving some fast Mexican food somewhere close to our home, so we stopped in here and I had the chorizo Burrito, and my husband got the enchilada plate!! Well now I have to have a chorizo Burrito at least once a week!! I absolutely love it!! I have never had anything bad from here! They always remember me when I call or come in!! Very friendly and fast service!! Great price for great food!! I have tried others but this one by far beats the rest with quality of food and cleanliness!! And of course again very friendly employees!! Thank you!! We will continue to visit you guys!!! :))))
