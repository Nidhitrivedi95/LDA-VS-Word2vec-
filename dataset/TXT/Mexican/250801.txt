What they ended up doing is a bland, generic looking build with an awkward dining room that lacks any form of personality. There's not really any good place to wait for your table to be ready inside or outside and you'll see people awkwardly sitting on the curbs in the parking lot while they wait. Sitting in that dining room you'd have no idea you were in a Mexican restaurant. The dining room has two story ceilings which are impressive, but just highlight the lack of thought that went into planning the space. The walls are bare. It's just a giant plain room with tables. There is a tile accent wall and fountain which are pretty enough, but are kind of boring and there doesn't really seem to be any rhyme or reason for them. The food here also leaves much to be desired. It's bland and cheaply made. Our quesadilla had fake velveeta-type cheese in it and was served with translucent lettuce and the smallest dollop of sour cream that was barely enough for a single slice of the quesadilla. Not only that, but it was a pretty small serving for the price. Only three little pieces. The fish tacos were bland and the sauce served on the side for them was decent, but super runny so it didn't really stick to the taco well enough to flavor it. Considering Mad Mex is right down the road, I probably won't find myself here at Emiliano's ever again.
