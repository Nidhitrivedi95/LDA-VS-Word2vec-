42TGx8KatGNPCi7rwOzazg First time coming to Verde and I must say I'm impressed.  The food was delicious, very filling, and reasonably priced!  I also enjoyed their signature blood orange margarita and it too was very delicious. I will definitely be coming back here for lunch. The restaurant was very clean and the server who was also the bartender was friendly as well!
