R5WkKWo9ae2gN2feWtB_4g I have eaten in the Serrano's in QC and really enjoyed the food. So I decided to give the menudo at this location a try. Well, not only was the bowl small, the store bought flour tortillas they served were dried out. Steer clear of the menudo and give something else on the menu a try.
