SUd3IyEN7n5OYEGyt_U5lg We came in 20 min before closing and while driving here we passed it (not knowing it being located in a gas station) 
Ben greeted us warmly, asked our first names then shook our hands. He gave us a brief run down of the restaurant since there were at least 3 regulars behind us-and all were letting us know. Once you go Jefe's you won't go back, or you'll NEVER want anything else. With that being said.... My expectations were high. And holy s#*t they were met! 
We ordered 3 pollo al pastor tacos, carne asada fries, 3 beef tacos, and a quesadilla made with Monterey Jack cheese carne asada & bacon! I canme with 5 other people (just wanna throw that out there....) it was our first time and we all got free drinks and refills. Ok back to the food.... The  carne asada is amazing the seasoning is FIRE the pollo al pastor omg! And the fries bomb! The freshness of the food is so good especially for being a gas station restaurant the quality and quantity is AMAZING! Prices are sweet too what you see on the menu is the price tax has already been added. 
3 tacos for 6$ can't beat it!
