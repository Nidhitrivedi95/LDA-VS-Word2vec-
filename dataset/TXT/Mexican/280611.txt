xyrQByVfX47bstcmP_k1BA I just love Mariscos, Im also very picky when it comes to the taste and how authentic they are. This place is on point, the servings are also very generous. The quality of food is amazing and the freshness is also there. I haven't been to any sea food restaurant that starts you off with the soup (viché) of the sea food. Usually you have to ask for it. 
Anyone who likes Mariscos will really enjoy this one, from the service, to cleanliness and feel. I give this place all 5 stars. Delicious. Clean. Friendly staff.
