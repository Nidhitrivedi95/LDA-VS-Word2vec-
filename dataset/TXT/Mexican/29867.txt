We have been to Secreto three times in the last month and highly recommend it to anyone wanting high quality Mexican food at decent prices in a comfortable Santa Fe-style setting with a friendly, proficient staff.

Ambience & Décor. Nicely furnished booths with high backs, and pillows - a great touch! On our first visit there was classic rock playing and the 2nd time there was a football game on over the bar. 

Food. Everyone has their favorite type of chips and salsa, and we prefer thin, crispy chips with fresh not-too-chunky salsa packing some heat and Secreto's delivered on both counts - kudos! The Carne Adovada, slow roasted smoked pork, in a red chile sauce was excellent, although a bit pricey for around $14 - that being said I took half home! The Chicken Quesadillas were also very good, and we wound up taking half home as well. On our next visit we downsized to the beef and bean burrito with no sides, and it was very good by itself as were my Tequila marinated beef street tacos.

Service. Waitress were very friendly and proficient!

Looking forward to our next visit!
