v04EmZIqReWVD_Ri3rofUA This is a true mom and pop restaurant. The food here is amazing and the staff be it quirky and feisty are wonderful genuine people. Prepare for a leisurely meal if you are in a hurry kindly mention it up front Or come back when you have more time. 
 Not only is the food wonderful Maria recognizes me warmly every time I come no matter how much time has passsd.. Everything is good but the mole is border line sinful.
