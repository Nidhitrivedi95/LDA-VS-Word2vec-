pup46G8qFBG8695RtbQNwA This restaurant is very poorly managed.  We waited in the reception area; with multiple other prospective diners; for greater than 30 minutes without any acknowledgement from any staff member.  You get the sense they don't care; or don't know what appropriate behavior is.  Since we were with a couple who wanted to try the food; we waited.  Once seated continued poor service.  15 mins to get water and 30 minutes to get a beer and 45 mins for the food..  Ultimately, a bartender offered the explanation that they were overwhelmed by several large, last minute reservations.  Maybe.  None of that is an excuse for the poor service and lack of communication to the customers. Maybe consider staffing your restaurant appropriately.  It's always understaffed.   Maybe Acknowledge those waiting and let them know it will be a long wait.  Several people waiting just left.
The food was good; not great; for new mexico style mexican.  
Too bad more people don't vote with their feet and not patronize this reastaurant until they get their act together.
