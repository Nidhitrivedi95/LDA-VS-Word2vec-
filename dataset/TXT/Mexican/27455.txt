3I7xY7DjWearTz7d4TGdbw Went here for a Sunday breakfast. After waiting more than 5 minutes to even be acknowledged at the hostess stand, it then took more than 10 minutes before we got menus or a drink order taken. All of the employees on shift (including the manager) just didn't seem to give a crap. As we were finally wrapping up our meal, the lunch shift staff was coming on, and they all seemed much more willing to actually do their job. I have frequented the Nando's locations, and could not believe the lack of service here. I probably won't be going to this location ever again, and being that it is the one closest to my home, probably none of them.
