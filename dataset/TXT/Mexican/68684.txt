As much as I'd like to give it 5 stars the tacos themselves lack what some of the other top places in Cleveland have, flavor and size.  It has improved somewhat on the menu.  I can't complain about the drinks here they do know how to make a great cocktail.  It is still a nice place to hang out during the summer.
