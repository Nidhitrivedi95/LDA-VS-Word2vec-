Unique Decor - Unique Entrees 
Not your typical Mexican food restaurant.


From the water feature and the verdigris copper topped tables in the quiet dining room (by today's standards) to the two patios by the waterfall, dining here is a pleasure.

The food is delicious and served generously. My favorite is the Blue Corn Enchiladas, especially the one stuffed with rock shrimp.  We find the food to be savory, perfectly spiced and seasoned but if you are new to NEW Mexican food check with your server for recommendations.

The Happy Hour is daily from 3:00 - 6:00 PM. Try the New Mexican Potstickers with corn cream sauce for a yummy starter.

The bar area has an outside patio and there is a lower patio where you can also enjoy a meal and beverage in view of the water fall and stream.

The Carlsbad Tavern & Restaurant dining room is one of the few in Scottsdale where you can entertain your friends who are wearing hearing aids and have them enjoy the occasion. The bar is noisier than the dining room.

Not far from the heart of the Scottsdale entertaining district.

Delicioso
