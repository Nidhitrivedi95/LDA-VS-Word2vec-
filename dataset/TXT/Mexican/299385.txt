ZkUWOdBA4T7pdUhT0dkRzQ First time at Barrio Queen was fantastic.  Everything from start to finish was delicious.  We arrived in time for happy hour and ordered the pork tinga stuffed poblano pepper, which is not on the regular menu.  The house Margaritas where excellent and well priced.  I definitely recommend the Chiles en Nogada, my date loved it.  I ordered the tacos and liked the variety of being able to mix and match.  We will definitely be coming back for a second round.
