FMo1PJTUV5OpyiZlnTM1Rg Only been here once so need to try more items before putting it in the rotation.  Food was good and I like that they have healthy options and a variety of items besides the usual Mexican/American items which we are all tired of seeing on the menu.  I like the décor and staff if very helpful and friendly.  My only concerns are that the food seemed too salty and the prices were high for stand in line to order Mexican food.  Also, 2 of my 3 items were warm (just above room temp) not hot, which was fine for the hot summer and may have been the intent for that dish.  I will try it again and so should you.
