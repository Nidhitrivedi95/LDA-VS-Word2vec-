9iNrlCktKG4QKgQra10EDQ OMG TRAIN YOUR STAFFF!! They are SO slow, don't know the menu and VERY forgetful. 
The food took 22 minutes, they let the Tacos just hit on the counter under the cashier's face while they waited for the steak to cook, everything was cold and not edible by the time I got my order. They forgot to include half the thing we paid for in the bag including the GUAC, because as you know it's EXTRA!
Never again, save your money! This was my second and last visit.
