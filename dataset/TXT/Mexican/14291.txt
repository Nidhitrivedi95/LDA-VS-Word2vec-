0rrq-d9iNL2rrLET61v7jg Ok margaritas and pretty good service...but the food in general is just not great at all. Not authentic Mexican and not good in general. The owners or whoever runs this place appear to have given up. The menu could be freshened up. I hear there's a better Laredo's somewhere in Madison. I ordered the pork carnitas and they were pretty much the only good thing I've had there...I don't think I'll be going there again unless it's during a late night and I'm in need of a margarita.
