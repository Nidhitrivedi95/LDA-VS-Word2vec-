rLTa-PztQLafDf70aKrNOA This place is great! My wife and I spend a few weeks in Albuquerque each year and we've learned a lot about New Mexican food. Gil's is better than 95% of the New Mexican restaurants in Albuquerque. To the comment on Gil's taco shells. this is a "New Mexican" restaurant. In "Mexican" food, hard tacos are fried crispy with the filling inside. In "New Mexican" food the filling is added to taco shells that "look like" store bought shells - that's how  authentic New Mexican tacos are made.
The other complaint I see from some yelpers is that they're not always open during their posted hours as they also have a catering business. Well, there's an easy answer; call first and you'll never be disappointed. 
Gil uses fresh Hatch Valley chilis and it makes all the difference in the world. Even in Albuquerque most restaurants use dried chilis as they're less expensive and have a longer shelf life. Gil's New Mexican chile is top notch. You gotta try it!
