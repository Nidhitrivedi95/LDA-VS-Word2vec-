DXl9YviWyzAwMeUtrBPW7w Gluten-free review:

The patio here is awesome and it's a perfect place to hang out with friends on a warm summer day. We were seated right away (no reservation) and our waiter came over almost instantly so we got our drinks very quickly - my kind of place already. 

I had a margarita, which was decent. Not the best I've ever had but far from the worst. We ordered a number of different tacos, which were all delicious. I have additional allergies so I needed to omit certain ingredients, which they had no problem doing. When I was ordering I asked if the tacos were gluten-free and the waiter said they were and specifically said they were celiac friendly. I didn't inquire into whether they prepare them in separate food stations to prevent cross contamination since I don't require that, so if you have celiac's disease be sure to confirm this. I had no reactions to the food.

There were 2 downsides, which is why they lost a star. First I asked for no avocado for my tacos because I was allergic, which I specifically told the waiter. We also ordered the ceviche, which we didn't realize had avocado in it, and the waiter didn't warn us. So I ended up only being able to eat the three pieces of fish at the top that weren't touching the avocado sauce at the bottom of the dish. Second, they did not have any gluten-free desserts. :(  

Overall, great food and vibe. I'll definitely be going back. 

TL;DR - tacos are celiac friendly, no gluten-free dessert
