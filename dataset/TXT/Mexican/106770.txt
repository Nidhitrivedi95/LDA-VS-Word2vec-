FMo1PJTUV5OpyiZlnTM1Rg I have been wanting to come in and try this place for a few months since I saw they were opened. Finally give it a try today... took a bite of the salmon (super fishy... in a bad way), a bite of the rice (absolutely no flavor) and one bite of the beans (completely bland) and walked out! The decor is really cool and the employees were extremely friendly but the food was REALLY bad! I was super bummed because I really wanted to like it but I won't be back!
