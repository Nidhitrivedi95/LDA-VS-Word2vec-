SZpzMUdhh1xu2qlegzSyLg Enticed by a sign outside that said "Tequilla $3", we decided to venture inside. After a few tequilla shots and sangria, I got hungry and ordered funky fries. When it arrived it looked like a Taco Bell fries supreme. It was fries with melted cheese that had the same viscosity as creamy mushroom soup, with a very unimpressive dollop of sour cream at the top. The only difference between this and the taco bell version, is that at taco bell you can get a cardboard box with it to go. 


Overall, go for the tequilla and drinks. If you're hungry, don't get the funky fries, however our waitress recommended their Tex Mex fries.
