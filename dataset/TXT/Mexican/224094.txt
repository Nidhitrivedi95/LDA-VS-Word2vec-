RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg I love me some street tacos, but they are not your typical street tacos. (In a good way tho) It gets really full and lines are crazy, but it's well worth it. Really noisy too, but most of the noise comes from the kitchen and it's usually the guys cutting up the stake. They're a total of five lines to order, each line is a different meat. A tip of advice: GET ALL YOUR TACOS THE FIRST TIME AROUND, THAT WAY YOU DONT HAVE TO GO BACK IN LINE FOR THE SECOND TIME.

Please note; YOU DO NEED TO HAVE YOUR ORDER IN HAND AND PAYED OFF IN ORDER TO SIT AT A TABLE!!!!!

The only issue I have is the fact that it is located way up north on the strip. It is not a walking distance from where most of the people are staying. It's one of Vegas hidden treasures
