MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA One star removed for feeling like we were consistently being pushed out the door, despite the fact that it was 5:30 on a Tuesday and my date and I arrived early so that we could enjoy ourselves without being rushed. That said, the spot was small and really ecclectic. A hipster's dream.  The tacos could only be described as little flavour bombs. They're small but they pack a powerful punch - definitely quality over quantity, and that's a good thing folks. We tried the spicy chicken, beef shoulder and Scrapple. I can't remember exactly what Scrapple was, but it was by far my favourite. So just order it. Seriously.

For dessert we tried the Key Lime (self-explanatory) and Electric Dirt. The latter was my favourite, a chocolate mousse with crumbled chocolate cookie layers above and below, starting creamy and ending with a combined black-chili pepper kick. Very different and very tasty.  

I wouldn't show up here starving, but for $3.60 a piece you could easily indulge in several of these puppies and not break the bank. Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't necessarily pick it for a date spot - it was possible to speak over the loud hip hop playing, but consistently being interrupted by the server so they can drop the bill on the table as soon as possible is not ideal.  If anything, go early, have a bite and head across the street to Rhino's patio for some after dinner imbibing.
