fY79hLjygu4zMtzE67Y4Xw Stopped in for a quick Sunday night dinner. It's a great place to order a quick meal and a nice family atmosphere. It has one of those coca cola machines that allow you to choose from different combinations of soda. They also feature a salsa bar for your never ending chips. The staff was nice and it's safe to say we will come back again.
