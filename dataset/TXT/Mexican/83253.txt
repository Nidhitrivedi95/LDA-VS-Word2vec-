D3MfMrIoNV4_aXPj0bi1BQ Second time dinning at Lopez. First time was great, I would say 4 or 5 star, but our most recent experience was very, very different. Went on a Wednesday night to celebrate some birthdays. Had 4 drinkers at the table so decided to order a pitcher of the mojitos for $43. We maybe got 4 short glasses out of it, 5 if you count all the ice when it melted. Super sweet, very little rum. For the price it was totally not worth it. A singe mojito (which I have had there before; decent size and you could taste the rum) is $8.50. We would have saved $9 if we had just each gotten our own mojitos. Super disappointing. Guacamole didn't come out until entree's did; so much for an appetizer. The Porkadelic BMF is just way too much meat. If you are into that, then go for it. But the individual in our party who got it could barely make it through half and then had an upset stomach the rest of the night. The Buenos Dias BMF was great,  we do recommend. Another  individual in our party ordered 3 different tacos, didn't receive 1 of them. We alerted the waitress, told her we didn't want the 3rd one that was ordered since we still had all the guacamole to finish and to take it off our bill. She said she would. Service was slow all around. When we did get the bill, found we were charged for two guacamole apps even though we only order one, and we had still been charged for 3 tacos instead of 2 (I am not going to explain in depth but short story is we watched her take off the one taco since we were right next to the POS machine, but she ended up charging us twice for one of the other ones we did get). Overall not a great dinning experience. Don't really wanna go back there again and it's a shame since it's so close and we share a name.
