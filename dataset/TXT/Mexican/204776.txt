They have creative filling combinations and generous portion sizes. On a few burritos they substitute sweet potato purée for beans, and while I'm not a huge fan I have several friends who swear by it. The east side isn't exactly overflowing with late night eating options, so thank you burrito drive for providing a valuable service.
