IfdwBSEuDK3fKvVHVX9k0A Love love love. Hubby & I found this fabulous little gem while in town on business. Wish we could have packed this place up and taken it home. Contrary to other reviews, we found the prices reasonable, the food flavorful, the portions generous and the service very friendly. We paid about $40 for an app (sweet potato fries- absolutely delicious and more than enough for 2), 2 entrees (I had panini from breakfast menu- possibly the best vegan sandwich I've ever had, very nice server had great suggestions to customize it- and he had a chicken sandwich that he really liked), freshly brewed iced tea (ginger peach- really good) and a giant cookie that we took to go because we were both stuffed. 

Restaurant is very veg friendly and even their meat items are from animals raised humanely, which I really appreciate. Next time we pass through Cleveland we will definitely make a stop here!!
