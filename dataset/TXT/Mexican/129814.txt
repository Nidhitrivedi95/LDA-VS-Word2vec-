I779CNMLWhZu6BxkGfLvwQ Great new place in town. I believe our AWESOME waitress, Nadia metioned that it is locally owned and you can expect an awesome fusion of Asian, Mexican and Northwest cuisines. We had the fish tacos, Spicy Tuna rolls and the Baja Chicken Salad. All of which were exquisite. I will definitely be back to try the other Sushi options as well as the Noodle options. Cant wait! 

I truly recommend this place. Enjoy!
