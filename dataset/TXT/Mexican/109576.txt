Not too happy with how the stuff is presented, especially the bowls. A slop of sour cream covering the entire bowl, stale chips, hard rice...just all a big fat no. And no this is not the first time this has happened, oh no...not the first.

Now that I think about it, I don't really know the appeal of Chipotle anymore.
