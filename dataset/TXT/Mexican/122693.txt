HGLMe4y0y_VsBkDLdpfBLA Beware of the person taking the reservations. She's an incompetent/arrogant/ little one. To make a long story short she got lost with 5 reservations. Clearly that is not the  job for her, and I wouldn't say nothing if she didn't become arrogant with me, when I explained my reasons. As soon I arrived and giving my name, she told me that I had to wait for at least 30 min. I told her ok, no problem. And what she does after 5 min? She calls my name, and also tells me that she went outside looking for me. Clearly a lie because she never came outside looking for me, if not I'd have seen her. When I told her that I wanted to speak with the manager about that, really she got her best of bad manners telling me that he was busy and i couldn't talk to him. She answered so fast to that request that I can just imagine how many times she used that excuse. Of course my wife and I left, and on our way out a very nice waiter (Travis), that understood the situation and nicely tried to invite me back in offering us a free dinner because of what happened. i just told him that it was not about the money it was about that treatment we received from that one. But at least he tried, thing that we appreciate very much. So be careful there, and please control your reservation, because she's incapable of doing her job. Alberto.
