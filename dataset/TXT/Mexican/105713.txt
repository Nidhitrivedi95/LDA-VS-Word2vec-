Atmosphere, quality, selection, quantity all exceed expectations.

It would be easy to miss this by assuming the strip mall location would yield strip mall results. This dining experience is exactly what this area of town needs. Quality in all the little things like the chips, salsa, tortillas, beans & rice add up to a very solid foundation. Add to that complex flavors in the red and green chilli, the enchilada sauce and carne asada and you are really getting somewhere. 

The owners make a point greeting and thanking arriving and departing diners. This personal touch bespeaks the pride they have in what they have provided.

It would be easy to dismiss the above as cheer leading because it sound effusive but do so at your own peril, the food here is really, really good.
