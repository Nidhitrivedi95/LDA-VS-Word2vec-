_2Wbpm821bdNsh-gyqufrg Its the 3rd time we come here and they don't have chicken to fill the order. This place needs new management, last time i came the breast on my plate was smaller then the wing, when I asked the manger whats with this small breast, looks like they were cut in half, she replied this is it.
Will never go to this location.
