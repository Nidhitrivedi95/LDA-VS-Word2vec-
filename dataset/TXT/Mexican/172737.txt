Mdr4xzMUeZQSakq3XJwG3w This has to be the best little Mexican place around nothing fancy at all. The food was great , great flavor in it the service was good 1 person as server and prices were good. Had the carne asada burrito it was so delicious it was real food. I will be back that's for sure that's why I give it 5 stars*****
