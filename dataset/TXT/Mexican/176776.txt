MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA Yes, this place is worth the wait...even if it is raining on a saturday night, even if you have to wait two hours, even if you are starving..... Here is how you can plan your nit around it.
1. Pick a night the hockey game is on.
2. Go and put your name down and walk over to the rhino across the street
3. Sit at the bar and order a few of the 356 beers ...Subject to season and availability.
4. Enjoy your company and wait for the call
5. Pay your bill and head over for a fantastic meal.

We got sat the the bar.. Small and busy, rest liveliness. The waitress is quick to get your order and tempting you to get the guacamole because youve been waiting so long....simply oblige and be satisfied when lovely plate of Guac and chips come out with a piece of crispy pork. I wasn't sure what all the hype was about this but the guacamole is creamy with little bits and the perfect amount of acidity. If you can avoid sharing the piece of pork, keep it to yourself.

We ordered two types of tacos.. Chicken and fish. All I have to say is..get the fish. Large piece of seafood that is perfectly cooked and full of substance and flavours. Every bite tastes amazing and I wanted more. The chicken was delicious as well... Nothing disappointed, just preferred the fish more!

I had waited this long.... So decided to get the tuna ceviche to top it off. Large chunks of tuna drizzled with lemon juices and other saucy goodness. S is not a big ceviche fan so more for me!!! There were some chips at the bottom you can combine with so it gives you more textures if you do not want to eat it solely by itself.

To end, the key lime pie...very creamy, but loaded with citrus. Definitely lived up to S's expectations... Oh one more thing... If you like sours like me, the electric sour will be your kind of drink.
