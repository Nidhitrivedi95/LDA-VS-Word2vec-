QF2P3oJqCJC9z0TPDDFVxw If I could give this place less than one star I would.... Don't come to this place expecting real Mexican food like I did. This is a cheap version of Chipotle that costs more. $10 for a burrito. 

I went in looking to order a burrito and the only worker there said there was no rice. So I couldnt order the tacos with rice/beans. I asked since they're out of rice if they could put a couple fries in my burrito instead. He said no- no substitutions.  

If you're going to run out of rice then be accomadating at least-especially for $10/burrito. 

My point is it's not legit Mexican.
