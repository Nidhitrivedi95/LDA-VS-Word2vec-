And it had a lot of white rice in it (aka cheap filler). I got a beef (bad choice - it was tough beef strips) burrito, that cost about $7.50.
It was also sticky (the bland white rice was so over cooked, it was on the verge of mush) and had very little flavour -- it didn't taste flavourful or fresh. 
I'm pretty positive everything in it was canned, which they conveniently actually sell on site. They have a small retail area, which consists of a few shelves of very basic Mexican canned product, such as retried beans and tomatillos.
I recognized the brand as one I've seen in No Frills in the ethnic food isle.

There are so many other 'mexicana' choices in Kensington, I will never give this place second look.
