Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ Boss took us here for long service celebration luncheon. 
Service was impeccable and the food was fine dinning quality.
We ordered a combination of chicken, beef and fish dishes and it came on a huge wooden platter. Presentation was 5 stars! It was perfect to share for a group of 8! And so delicious!!
There's a tequila wall that like a piece of artwork.
