nv-w-aL2Jn9TRJAH0mMz1w Two weeks ago, my husband and I ate at Salsaritas, then went across the parking lot to the grocery store. Within 20 minutes, I realized that I had left my waistpack at Salsaritas. The employees behind the counter did not know about it. My husband and I went home, checked the location of my phone (which was inside my waistpack) and found it to be behind Salsaritas. We went back there and found it carefully placed on the pavement next to the dumpster, behind the restaurant. Nothing was missing--hmm. we went back into the restaurant and told the employees where we had found it. After thinking about it, I decided to call the manager the next day, just so that he would know that possibly an employee had stashed it outside to investigate its contents later. The manager (Chris) was extremely rude and said that none of his employees would do something like that. He said it could have been a teenager (customer) who saw me leave, but , I said, would a teenager carefully leave it outside or just get all of the cash, the phone, etc. and sling the pack in the ditch? He then began raising his voice. 

Instead of being tactful and thanking me for letting him know, he just lost two loyal customers.  Good food, bad management. Don't leave anything valuable there!
