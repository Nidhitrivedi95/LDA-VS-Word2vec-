GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog J.A. impresses once again with China Poblano.  The restaurants decor is just plain awesome. It's a restaurant with two different sides, one Mexican and one China. Each with its own decor traditional of that country.  The food was so delicious.  The dim sum is a must as well as the mango sticky rice.  Make sure you come hungry because there is a lot of tasty things to order from but only so much room in your stomach lol.
