2HxaDXZmAOH6LiuzGgNdPA Salty and cold ! What a disappointment the hamburger literally tasted days old. The meat was so salty and dry and they don't even use mustard or ketchup ? The fries were soggy. I did a half n half with the zucchini that was a mistake 1 piece is 1/2 of a zucchini fried ? Ok I'm not trying to eat a whole zucchini with my food. For over 10 bucks and a 15min wait no way hell I wouldn't pay 5$. Stay clear better options out there!
