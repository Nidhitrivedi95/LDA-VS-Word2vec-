4K5NUsinIgtq-yuxdp2HdA I loved this place but it has been less than average lately.  I go here strictly for Taco Tuesday's.  $1.50 tacos.

First time I went here, I was amazed at how tasty the Tempura Fish Taco was.  I like how it is topped with feta cheese.  I smother my tacos with their butt burning hot sauce.  I dare try not to test the habanero sauce.

The issue is not the food.  Service, presentation, and time to get my food is what makes this 3 stars.  Their cashiers are always slow.  And the time it takes to make 2 tacos seems like eternity.  To top it off, the portions of meat in the tacos have shrank and it seems they just through everything all over the place.

I don't know what happened but this place is going down.  Hopefully it gets better soon.
