ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA My husband and I are familiar with Sacha Levine's cooking from her days at FnB. We were eager to try out her newest venture in central Phoenix. The huge space is really eye-catching, and I can't wait for it to warm up just a bit more so we can dine outside.

We've been twice so far, for brunch and dinner. We came at slower times so we didn't encounter any service issues. Our food came out quickly and piping hot both visits.

For brunch, my husband got the steak, eggs and potatoes which he absolutely loved. The flavorful steak was cooked perfectly, and the potatoe hash thing on the side looked sinful. I thought it was a great value for $20. He wasn't that happy with the cabbage salad however. I liked it ok but thought it could use a little punching up. My falafel burger was good but needed way more dressing and/or pickles. When I had the leftovers at home the next day, I liked it even more with extra toppings. The fries on the side were absolutely divine. 

Our dinner visit was with friends. We started with the roasted cauliflower which was decent but below my expectations. Our dining companions loved the ribeye steak and pork tenderloin (from the small plates). Their daughter and I both had pasta dishes, and I was impressed with the homemade pasta. My little shells were dotted with kale and goat cheese and swimming in a squash sauce that wasn't too heavy on the cream.

I was absolutely stuffed and couldn't stomach any desserts. I can't wait to try them out with some coffee on my next visit.
