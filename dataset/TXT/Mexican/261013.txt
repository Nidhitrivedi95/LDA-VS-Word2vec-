VRwT0pscR5vESCrAnUpNwQ A friend took me here randomly one day and I was pleasantly surprised and came back soon after! The atmosphere was really laid back and fun and it was just a nice place to hang out with some friends. I really liked the guacamole here, everything is fresh and flavourful. Tacos were great, and the salads were not bad but probably wouldn't get it again. The salsa bar is really fun, I tried all of them and they were all pretty good - there was a good selection and something for everyone. Would definitely come back here for a Mexican fix.
