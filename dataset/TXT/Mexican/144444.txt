JEQaPs7jNT1M2os9lJDlUA So my sweetheart and I came here after a negative experience at Nami across the street.  

I ordered an Iced tea and the crabby benedict.

The iced tea was a fruity tea and very yummy. 

Now the crabby benedict. Never before have I tasted such unique flavor combinations. The bread they served it on was a flavorful focaccia bread. The eggs were very nicely poached. Just instead of ham they put a crab cake on it! (I love crab!)

The service was very friendly and he had an excellent personality. 

Next time I'll have to come back and try the dinner menu. It looked incredible.
