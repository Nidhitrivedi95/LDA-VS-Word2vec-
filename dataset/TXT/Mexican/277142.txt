Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ Super cool looking place and it was busy. We sat at the bar to eat because there was a 20 minute wait. 

While our first bartender was friendly enough, he went on break shortly after he served our drinks and we didn't see him again. In his place was a surly man that clearly did not want to be there and hates his life. Our food came, and I did not like the dressing that came with my salad. When I asked the surly bartender to swap it out, he literally acted as if I was asking him for one of his kidneys. I asked for one of the other vinaigrettes that I saw came with a different salad, and he claimed it did not exist. He was literally looking at me and my friend as if he hated us, and we are quite pleasant people. Ha! Also, he only gave us the copy to sign when he brought us the bill. When I asked for a copy to take home, again he glared at us. Not a pleasant dining experience at all.

Food wise, my chopped salad likely would have been good if I had had a dressing to go with it. The one that was originally brought to me was way over seasoned with black pepper, so much so that I sneezed when I tasted it. They did include plenty of shrimp, so no complaints there. My friend said his mole chicken was just OK, so wouldn't recommend that. The chips were fresh and the salsa was tasty. I also really liked my organic margarita, probably because it was made by the friendly bartender and not the miserable one.
