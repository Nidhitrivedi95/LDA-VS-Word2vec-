ZbHE1ZncONeH-q93GuVGdA We ordered a few items to-go this evening and were very disappointed with what we received. Hubby ordered a chimichanga plate, it was OK, but not great. The beans were salty and the rice was dry, but the chimichanga was tasty. We also ordered three beef tacos, chips and cheese, and a burrito. We got three chicken tacos, chips with no cheese, and a burrito with a torn-to-hell tortilla that fell apart when unwrapping it. I used the chips to scoop burrito filling, since we didn't get the cheese, so it wasn't a total loss, but it was not what we paid for. Not at all.
