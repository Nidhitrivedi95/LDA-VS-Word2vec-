ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA This is a nice spot to meet up with friends and have drinks. I would definitely give it a solid 3.5. I appreciate the cleanliness, the environment and I have always had a good experience with the staff. 

To be perfectly honest, the last time we went, we chose La Comida because our first choice for dinner had too long of a wait time. You can look at it as though we settled or you can look at it as us choosing it because we knew it was a safe bet that it would be a solid meal.

Our waiter was hilarious and engaging and the food was very timely. I chose the breaded shrimp tacos (Camaron Al Maya) and didn't regret it. I'm a wuss when it comes to spice, so the jalapeno cream was just the right amount of "kick" - any more and it would have been too much (for me). Their appetizer, queso fundido is a group favorite of ours, alongside the guacamole and the street corn. 

Overall a solid experience and a safe bet when choosing a place to eat.
