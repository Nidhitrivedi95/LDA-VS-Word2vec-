8USUyIeN39rurnqCn5cA0w My husband and I have lived in Las Vegas for four years.  We came from Southern California where we are very accustomed to excellent Mexican food.  We have been on a search since living here to find a good restaurant.  (We have tried many).  It was during that quest that we came upon Los Lupes from a Yelp review.  It is the best I've found here.  The chips are thin, as I like, and salsa is delicious.  The food has the authentic Mexican taste that I have loved my whole life.  We had drinks that were enjoyable as well.  It seemed as though everyone was devoted to ensuring an enjoyable eating experience for us, and I can assure you, it was.  We will be going back.
