ms7cmWkPiSBDTnz-1sv2kQ I live nearby and was really excited to try this place, since the parking lot is always packed!

I hate to say it, but there was nothing good enough to draw me in for another visit :/

The food was ok but nothing special. I ordered the sweet corn tamales. I love tamales and I love sweet corn, but the execution left much to be desired. As in, my sides of beans and rice had to suffice as my dinner.

The decor was so bad it was distracting. Granted, I watch Restaurant Impossible, so maybe I notice these things more than the average person. But dust, tacky wall art and poorly patched booth seats just ruin the ambiance. 

Like I said, I hate to judge on only one visit, but I'm not willing to pay for a second!
