Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ we had a groupon, so decided to give it a try.  I had the cheese crusted quesadilla and my bf had a chicken burrito.  He said his burrito was pretty good, I was quiet impressed with my order, being an appetizer, it wasn't much, but it was big on flavor! Our server, ( I can kick myself for not remembering his name) was awesome!  He wasn't even supposed to be our server.  He came over after noticing our table was wobbly and he fixed it.  Then he told us he didn't know where our server was but he had waters on the way.  He earned his tip right then and there.  He continued to take fantastic care of us.  When our entree was delivered, it was delivered by someone else (our intended server)?  Who knows, but this kid settled our bill and we left him a nice tip.  Hopefully he got to keep it and didn't have to share it.
