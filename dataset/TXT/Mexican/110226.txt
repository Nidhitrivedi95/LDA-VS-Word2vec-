FVgHb9w4pnkRBV5bZYJaZA HORRIBLE SERVICE. Took the order almost 30 minutes to come out. The employees wer very ghetto and claimed oranges wer lemons. Behind the kitchen there was like 8 people and none got things done. Employees wer drinking soda and placing it on the prep tables and wer not wearing gloves. This is pathetic. One of my favorite places had gone Down. Never coming again.
