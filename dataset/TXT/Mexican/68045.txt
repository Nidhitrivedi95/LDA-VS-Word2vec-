BHMY0sZXJ-6bjTT0V1ubEw Best chipotle location. I go to chipotle 5+ times a week and this is my favorite one. Also give a good helping of items. Staff is super nice. Never gets too crowded and they are very fast and efficient here. Very consistent. Major props to management and training here. No complaints.
