Wzx5tF9-PaWfWSirdq8Ulg I have been to this location multiple times and can say that consistently: the food is good, the service is terrible. The employees always seem put out that they have to do their jobs. The trash cans are always overflowing. An employee seemed put out that they had to stop texting at the register to ring us up. The manager seriously needs to fix their staff issue or no one will come back for the food.
