rp1TgQObnIIRZw3fHWSwJA Don Patron is my new go to place for Mexican food. The management of Luchitas should frequent their place and see first hand what makes then successful - from the top down. I'll only visit Luchitas if I'm walking downtown and want to get a drink.  Luchitas bar is much better but that's where it ends.
