IUv-dRWHyds6ncxqVcxpGQ cool concept, pretty good food but SO rushed that you can't really do a custom order because you are pushed through the line so quickly. Also if you order one of their recommended options, they are moving so quickly that the tacos are like one big taco blob...not really individual tacos. I had the chino tacos which were great, except I had to eat with a fork. Advice to tru taco - slow it down.
