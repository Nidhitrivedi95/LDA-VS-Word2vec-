6Q89zbIFWpjvzD5UWHVgcQ Four of us were their for our usual dinner party. I like that all if their menu items have photos. 
We got the biggest mixed ceviches, with octopus, fish shrimps with passion fruit base and all dressed. We were very disappointed the taste. It was quite sour. 
The grilled octopus was good,it was lightly seasoned, which is exactly the way I wanted. 
The pork bun was bad, it had a disgusting smell to it and have no flavour. 
The tacked were ok. 
He paella was exceptional well done, so fresh and flavourful. 
All over very friendly service but everything but the paella was average
