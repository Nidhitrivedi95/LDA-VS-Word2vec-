iBlQvqiy5Rg2h-y9TS1yOA This is my happy hour spot! I always come here with my fiancé and mom for drinks and Asa (male bartenders with the tattoos) always takes great care of us. He is our favorite, but the entire staff is really sweet too. The food and margaritas are delicious and they have great happy hour deals. The inside of the restaurant is beautiful and stays clean. They always have good music on too which I love because we do tend to hang out for quite some time. I recommend this place to everyone!
