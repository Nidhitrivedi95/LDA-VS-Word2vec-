fXUJ9d5R6kNXrnAouByB6g Came here to try out the tacos al pastor, a friend recommended them. I stopped in today and ordered 6 tacos al pastor a burrito and 6 other tacos. They were prepared quickly, I'm glad I checked the bag because 2 tacos were missing. I went back in and told the girl that 2 tacos were missing....she responded by asking me why...lol why?? I thought to myself...that's a damn good question..(not the smartest one of the bunch) I gave her my receipt and she checked everything. I got my tacos and left. I am giving this place 1 star because as a consumer I feel customer service should be #1 priority for the business and business owner. It clearly isn't for some people including this girl. It seemed like she didn't want to be there, if I was the owner I would reevaluate the employees. Get rid of the ones who dont want to be there and get some people who do. I know its not everyone's life dream to work in a taco shop but I have met some passionate people in the past that put 120% into all they do and it shows. Some past reviews have commented on the same issue....that was in 2015...c'mon B.O. If you need a payment processing system I know the right people who can hook you up. 
In conclusion I won't be coming back to this place. The food was good not great, another negative having to pay for every single miniscule thing. Which means your business must not be doing that great if you have to pinch every penny. I wish you and your business the best.
