dCPyV8XCEyE7pyUgzOCDKA This location really disappointed me tonight. They rushed me through my order and before I even finished they were going to the next person- they closed my bowl before I even had a chance to ask for everything I wanted then got annoyed when I asked for lettuce . They also charged me for a chicken bowl when it was a veggie. You need new staff here
