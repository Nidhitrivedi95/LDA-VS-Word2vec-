IMoMOGoIDabx_Gnkw4-mmg My wife and I have become regulars of Cozumel.  The drinks are good. The Food is great. the prices are reasonable. The service sometimes is just so-so (usually because they are busy).  Tonight I had the shrimp fajitas for a change and it is as good as all the rest of the meals I've had there. They are close to Rte 77 and 480 which is a plus too (I stop on the way home for take-out sometimes).  Try them you won't be disappointed and I swear I'm not related or employed by them.  Just real glad to have some real good Mexican food close by.
