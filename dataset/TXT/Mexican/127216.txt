HWl2EbZhkhAkFgqt44yUkA Pretty good experience. We did have to wait maybe 10 min. (Of course it's not long but we were a little confused because it didn't seem busy at all) but it wasn't a big deal, went to the bar and the "yard" drinks were $35 but buy one get one which was nice. Drinks were okay nothing special but fun anyway. Out waitress was kind and our food was good, again nothing special but they did have buy one get one 50% off for football specials so that was awesome. Price wise it definitely was a good pick for a quick early dinner!:)
