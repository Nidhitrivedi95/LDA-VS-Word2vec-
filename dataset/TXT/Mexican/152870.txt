It is so good and if you add a little Cholula...AMAZING! They have a large menu to choose from. I have tried a lot of different things and have never been disappointed. I would suggest trying one of their quesadillas (either the mexicano or the fajita) because they are so so good! The service is excellent and they get your food out to you quickly. It is great for big groups and families as well. 

The only downfall (for me) is the margarita. They are premade and come from a machine. They are neon green and I think they taste like sugar water with a hint of margarita flavoring and tequila.  They have a great selection of Mexican beers and a full bar to make up for it though!

Otherwise this is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants on the west side!
