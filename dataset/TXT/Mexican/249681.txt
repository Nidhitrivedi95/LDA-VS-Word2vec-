UhyDVz7npxKUl9BfMpfmBw Who would have thought I'd find Rosarita Beach street tacos in a legacy Las Vegas shopping mall? The carne has that crisp edge but tender inside. The cilantro and flavoring is the right balance and you can adjust the heat with your pick of salsa. The traditional corn double tortilla that wraps it adds a bit of sweet to combine with the other distinct tastes. They choose quality ingredients to create this masterpiece. It takes a while. It's not exactly fast food but it is worth checking your email for a bit until they finish your meal just for you. I haven't tried their other dishes but I'm considering going back to the mall just to eat.
