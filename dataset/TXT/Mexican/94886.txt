EBcugzKWrUKMo4JFEWBu2g I've visited Chili's in the good old U.S. of A., so I was excited to see that the chain was pushing into Canada. After dining here.....I'm not that excited anymore.

Let me preface this by stating that I haven't dined here in about a year, as my last experience was so disappointing that I swore I would never go back. Our group of 4 all remember the last time as a deal killer.

On our last visit the place was a jumpin'. We had a nominal wait for a table and while waiting we thought to ourselves..."This is great....a busy restaurant is usually a sign of good food" 
Wrong.
The waiter was awful. His approach was off putting from the get go (he had someone trailing him so I would assume he was training someone??). Wrong person to do so. His was very robotic/unfriendly and didn't seem to really like working there. He commented to the person with him how he couldn't wait to get out of there. After tasting the food, I now understand what he was taking about. Anyways, we asked a question about a menu item and the sigh that came from the guy was audible to Vancouver....

Once we ordered, the food took forever to come out. When it did, it was not HOT, it was lukewarm. It also tasted like cardboard...absolutely no flavour considering the place is called Chilis. We did not complain to our waiter due to his already foul mood and besides, once our food was in front of us we never saw him again except when we flagged him down to get our bill. We did not finish our meals (a good waiter would have picked up on the fact that 4 people left half their meals on their plates and would ask.....but not ours).

We paid our bill (which was pricey considering the quality of what we got).

Sorry if I can't be more specific about what we ordered, etc....but it has been a while since I've been here. The whole experience was not pleasant at all and that is what we remember the most.
