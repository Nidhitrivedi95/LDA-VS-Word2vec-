So, because Sammy Hagar donates his profits to charity (what an awesome gesture), I will gladly give his expensive airport restaurant a five star review. 

Yes, it's overpriced, even by airport standards. My "Sammy's Breakfast Burrito" (Flour tortilla, scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, guacamole, pico de gallo, queso fresco, with bacon or sausage) ran 14 and a half buckaroos and a coffee (Seattle's Best and EXCELLENT) ran $3.50. So after tax, that's like $20 which was definitely too much for what I got.

But let me say this, my breakfast plate was pretty darned good. Lots of scrambled eggs, lots of sausage, great tasting guacamole and pico, and a generous scoop of home fries. 

But that pricing! You can get a hotel style buffet for that money, but hey -I wasn't at a Marriott or a Sheraton brunch, I was at the Las Vegas Airport.

Service was fine, with multiple check backs and coffee refills.

I liked the music in the restaurant a lot. Between Sammy Hagar commentaries, I heard the Stones, the Who, AC/DC, Talking Heads and a great old song-Spirit in the Sky by Norman Greenbaum. 

I wonder if I can write off my breakfast as a tax deduction?
