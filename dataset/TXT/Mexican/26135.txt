3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ Mmmm get the steak taco with the blue cheese. It's so good!!! Margaritas for happy hour are great, but they just increased the price. Kind of lame... it should've stayed at $5 flat, but it's a great margarita. Kind of wish they had more taco options for their $2 taco during happy hour. But get the steak one. So. Good.
