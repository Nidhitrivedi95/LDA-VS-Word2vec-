XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg This restaurant was absolutely delicious.  My friend Eric recommended we try it and I am glad we did. The pork tenderloin was perfectly cooked, tender and so tasty.  The brussel sprouts were a delicious complement and then to have the banana creme pie dessert was just perfect.  And the signature cocktail was tasty.  I liked the decor and has a very cool trendy vibe.  This restaurant is a must try if you're in Vegas.
