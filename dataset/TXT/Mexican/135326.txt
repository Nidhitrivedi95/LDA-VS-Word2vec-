IMoMOGoIDabx_Gnkw4-mmg I visited this location with a large group of co-workers not expecting it to be that good.  I was impressed with the service, taste, and portion.  Ordered chicken quesadilla and it was really good.  Their chips and salsa were very tasty.  I loved that habanero sauce was available if you wanted to turn it up a notch.  The service was excellent for our large group. Very fast food prep too!  This Cozumel location makes me want to visit one nearby to my house.  I will definitely be taking my family to Cozumels in the future!  Thank you for the great experience!
