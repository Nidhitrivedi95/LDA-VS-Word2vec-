XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg I've been dying to try the Mesa Grill for the longest time.  That Bobby Flay is practically on half of the cooking shows on the Food Network, and his food always looks so darn tasty!  So, how can I go to Las Vegas without trying the Mesa Grill?  When I finally tried one of his creations, it was Amazing! And For the first time, I kind of wished I had two stomachs, just so I could eat some more of his food!  I ordered the special, the Rabbit and pea risotto.  Sounds odd but  it was absolutely GREAT!  The bread they give us was not good, but hey, it's complimentary so I am not mad =]

We went in as a party of 8, and our server was very polite, attentive & helpful.  Comfortable atmosphere & amazing food, I am coming back for more.  Go Bobby!
