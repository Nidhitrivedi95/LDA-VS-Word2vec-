We ordered the guacamole and there couldn't have been more then a half of an avocado. The portion was so small. There was no taste to it. We asked for the spiciest one and we had to add a ton of salt to it to even taste anything. The spicy slaw was bland, not spicy at all. To top it off, we both have some stomach issues today. That was the only thing we ate yesterday so I am wondering if something was up. I will try it again at some point. Maybe it was just an off day.
