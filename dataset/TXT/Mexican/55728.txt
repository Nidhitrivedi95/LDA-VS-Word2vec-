a_ai1uMhAqQSYaO_QNmnSw Alejandro wasn't our server but absolutely the reason this place gets a 5 star review! He made sure we were well taken care of when our server was no where to be found and made sure to check with us at the end of the night! Also loved the manager checked on us too! As a server that really makes a difference! Great food, outstanding service!
