ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA Attended my grand daughter's wedding held at Ocotillo yesterday. What a great venue!  
Outside, grass, lighted trees, couches, fire pit and THE best food I have had in a long time. My rib eye was probably the best I have ever had. The hors douerves  were fabulous. 
All in all it was a perfect venue and a perfect day!
