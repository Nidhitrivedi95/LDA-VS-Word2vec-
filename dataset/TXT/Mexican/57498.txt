a8pmtlVKf7NiSLI-4KejIw I went to El Catrin a few weeks ago with my business partner and two clients-turned-friends and we were in for a surprise. We weren't told much prior to arriving and being led to the "secret location" so when we walked in, our jaws dropped. 

The place is stunning - I can't believe the change! The ambiance is incredible whether it's a business meeting or a date. 

We ordered a huge long list off the dinner menu, including the ridiculously delicious and fresh guac which we devoured. Twice. 

The fish tacos blew my mind and to be honest, weeks later, I'm still thinking about them and the wine. 

The portions are small and the prices are high which is why I have to say 4 stars rather than 5 stars, however now and again when you deserve a treat, this is where you need to go. 

I'm already planning my next evening out at El Catrin. 

P.S. The person handling the negative reviews (which most of them are quite rude and annoying anyway) deserves a raise for the eloquent and professional manner in which he responds to feedback.
