nUfeYJ_YEaDzggPKnYry3g Let's start with the good. I came here with my boyfriend on a Thursday night and there was no wait. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the patio seating is relaxing. The staff was all extremely helpful and friendly. 

Being Mexican American I have an idea of what Mexican food should taste like. I ordered the pork enchilada with red sauce. First, they served us chips and salsa. Nothing was hot or spicy. Very very mild and not very flavorful. I asked for hotter salsa and received a slightly less boring taste with the new batch. Not impressed. 

Our food soon arrived and I was starving! The red sauce on my enchilada was another big miss. It was so boring and plain. No favors what so ever. Wouldn't go out of my way to come here again. Hope they take another look at their menu and try to make it more traditional to Mexican flavoring.
