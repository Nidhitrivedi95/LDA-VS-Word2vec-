Rj-7ymdw8aNZBRqGRAjR3Q Guacamole. Really REALLY good, made to order guacamole. That's all that needs to be said.  But, I will say a little more.  Start off with an awesome margarita, I loved the blackberry! Try (and this won't be easy) to not gorge yourself on the chips and guacamole, not to mention that the salsa is pretty dang good too and the chips are hot, crispy and corny. If you have not filled yourself to the brim with guac I recommend the sweet corn tamales.  I have been looking for some of these tasty little gems for a couple of years now since my favorite place closed and these come as close as I have had. These are just stinking good.  I am full, I am happy, I wish my stomach could hold more of this goodness.  Thanks El Segundo.
