eSENXDnnNSo-MLLkWJQ8Vg I used to love this place. My husband, daughter and I used to come here once a week. Then they added the extra vegetarian options. Yay! Because I'm a vegetarian.

Definetly TRY this place at least once. It is good. And if you are vegetarian or vegan you will loooooove it. I promise. It just isnt one of those "eat once a week" kind of restaurants anymore.

I'm not going to give it 5 stars now, even though 6 months to a year ago I would've given it 5 stars (is 10 possible?) For some reason the prices went up and the quality of the food feels like it has been steadily declining. Everytime we go its just not what it used to be. Maybe there's new management? A new cook? I'm not sure. But if you had asked me 6 months ago about the place I would not have hesitated to recommend it. 

Its definetly authentic though I'll give them that. I love this restaurant and really hope that the quality starts going back up because I miss eating there. It was the only restaurant my family and I would go to. And with the new vegetarian options. My goodness, I would eat here every day!
