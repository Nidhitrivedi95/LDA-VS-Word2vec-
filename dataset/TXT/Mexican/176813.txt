MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA I am on the hunt for the best fish tacos around the city and I have to say Grand Electric is definitely up there on my list! I love the atmosphere, anywhere that combines Mexican food with loud hip hop music is fine by me. The nacho chips are a little greasy but the delicious tacos make up for it. In terms of drinks I personally think they should add an Old Fashioned to the menu but the Grand Fashioned is still pretty tasty. I will be back!!
