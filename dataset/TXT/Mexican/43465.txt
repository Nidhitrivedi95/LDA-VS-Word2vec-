7GGJlp1aWfcXGQz6q7SkXQ I'd recommend giving The Rockhouse a try.  The food was pretty good and they had vegetarian options.  The staff was unsure of the actual beer specials however and this is what the manager on the street had lured us in with.  That was quite disappointing, expecting a reasonable $3 beer and then it actually being $6 can deter my patronage for sure!

We were in during a slow lunch hour and the food was quite slow to arrive and waitress was not very attentive.  There are for sure plenty of options on the strip, but I'd give them another shot when back in Vegas.
