Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at this restaurant.  I recently stayed at the Wynn and decided to come here on a whim.  It was so good that I came back the next day.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the benedict nautica is out of this world.  I love salmon and eggs, and this is truly the best preparation of this dish that I have had.  I also had the pastrami and eggs and wasabi bloody mary, which were very good.

I also loved the service and atmosphere of the restaurant.  The service was quick and attentive, and the decor is very interesting, light, and airy.  

This is definitely a pricey place for breakfast, but I think it is totally worth it.
