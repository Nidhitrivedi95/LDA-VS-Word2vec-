Upon being seated, I was given a basket of complementary chips, (1st basket is free), I sat there waiting for salsa and forgot that there is a salsa bar with numbers of salsa to try out. I've decided to order just tacos and all were delicious. In order of best to least favorite was shrimp taco, fish taco, Aztec tinga taco (chicken), and finally a Sonoran carne asada. I highly recommend this place for anyone who enjoy tacos. I've seen neighboring tables had huge burritos and decent sized serving of margaritas, which I would love to try on the next visit.
