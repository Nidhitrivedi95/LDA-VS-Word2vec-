ECqc9Xd0dTdKmcNrbIizAw I agree, similar to other American-Mexican restaurants.  A few things that make them a little different:  The Carne Asada comes out on a sizzling skillet with grilled onions (definitely not diet food), very tasty, and the golden margaritas are simply the best I have ever had, which is why I rate 4 stars. They now have a patio, and for cold winter days, the bar is cozy.  Restaurant decor could be a little more authentic, and salsa  is definitely not the best I have had, however, overlooking these minor imperfections,  prices are extremely reasonable, and the staff is wonderful!
