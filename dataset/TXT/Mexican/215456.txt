QYuojrlW94mpEwnp0uUIWA I have followed this joint on Instagram for a while now and was in the area. The place was clean at first glance. The gentleman taking our order brought us complimentary chips and salsa which was sort of a ceviche based sauce and it was good. We bother ordered BLT burgers and 1 order of bacon cheese fries. The burger was on point, the bread was hearty enough not to get soggy and the meat was very good. The cheese bacon fried were very good also, it was a mix of nacho and shredded cheddar cheese. Overall the food was great and came out just like my Instagram account portrayed it. I would recommend his place for burgers to anyone who likes good burgers.
