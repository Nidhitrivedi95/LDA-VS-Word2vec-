4KKmloORuH47OySm9Fq6ug I've heard the tacos were great and decided to try. With the tacos I also ordered a side of rice. The tacos were great as told but there was something extra in the rice of the insect kind. I brought this to there attention so they could see. They offered to replace but no thanks. I left the tacos too.
