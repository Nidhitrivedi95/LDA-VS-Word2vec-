CLthP1yn32xlBswIbsLIjQ I would like to change my previous review however, I can't. That being said.....They have such friendly staff and prompt service here. The food is fresh and inexpensive. It may not be the best in town but it definitely is worth the money. I also love the fact that I can order late if I get a midnight craving. I'm very happy to see that they are still in business after all these years.
