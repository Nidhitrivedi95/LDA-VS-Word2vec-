FutUAQPBfCeTmqytfDW1pA Not sure what this says about the other Chipotles in the area, but...I stopped in last night for a burrito bowl and had a very pleasant experience. Unlike its suburban cousins, this Chipotle was clean, well staffed, and the line kept moving. The people making the food were a little stingy with the grub, but...a little less food at Chipotle probably isn't a bad thing. 

My fiance and I both felt like this Chipotle is much nicer than the locations we frequent near home. Highly recommended...for fast casual food.
