mz1zD5_eqyCQNuzAqB_iKg I'm vegan myself and I was so happy to come across this gem! They have a separate vegan menu which is great & easy to order off of. I had the molletes with deep fried avocado as a topping and it was amazing! Also had their asada fries but it didn't come with vegan beef so it was okay. Healthiest asada fries I've ever had haha. Their proportions are pretty big. I'll definitely be coming back!
