ucJ17aXhHoIYmHrneOLI-A Beautiful decor. Mediocre food, at best. The water didn't taste right. The salsa was just okay. I ordered chicken fajitas which were bland and not even worth eating. Husband ordered green sauce chicken enchiladas. He said they were alright. Nothing to write home about. Best Mexican we've had is Lopez in Cleveland Heights or Tres Potrillos. We could have gotten better food at Taco Bell...
