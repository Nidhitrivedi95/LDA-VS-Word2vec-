Cd2ERofxOeCbCi-0yDs0aw Great new restaurant in a tough to spot location. Look for a bright yellow painted van in the front of the parking lot. 

Live nearby and have stopped twice now. The menu is shorter than most people expect from a Mexican-type spot, but to me that's a the sign of a good restaurateur: do what you know, only what you know, and do it right. Maria's does that. Food both times was absolutely delish. 

On top of good food, this really is a family owned AND operated business by people who couldn't be nicer or more accommodating. 

So do yourself a favor and find the yellow van. 

Update: I have made this one of my go-to spots - a couple of stops per week for breakfast burritos and one a week or every other week for lunch / dinner -  and tried a number of items. Everything has been absolutely delish. Green chile fry bread is off the charts. Breakfast burritos are huge and very good. 

Give them a try. They're in kinda a tough location (hard to see fm the road), but this is absolutely one of those family joints worth supporting and keeping in the neighborhood.
