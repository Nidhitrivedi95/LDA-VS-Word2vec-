SW6ZQk22G1_CV81_gfnvNQ These tacos are amazing ! I have been twice now and I love the food and the atmosphere. 

The tortillas are great not dry at all. Pretty authentic in my opinion. 

The toppings are amazing, full of flavour. I had the ceviche tostada, beef cheek, carnita and in cod we trust. All amazing. The carnita which has pork in it was probably my favourite. But they were all so amazing it was hard to choose. 

I also had the tres leeches cake which was good but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to order again because I wasn't crazy about the cherries on top. 

I will def come back time and time again !
