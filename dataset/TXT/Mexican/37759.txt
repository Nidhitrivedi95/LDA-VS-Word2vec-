5VLwQAIheQwmpusFa-tC6w usually frequent this chipotle often, but after my most recent visit i won't be returning. my friend asked for no salsa as she is allergic to tomatoes got a spoon full on her bowl, the worker threw the bowl out to start a new one, and had a terrible attitude, she also asked for only cheese guac and lettuce and they put a heaping scoop of sour cream on it.  as for my own food the meat portion was terrible, almost no meat. might as well if ordered a rice and sour cream bowl.
