9q0s7-EfafubLeLUJg_7BQ I come here once a month or so! So delicious! The pupusas can be ordered with pork, beans, cheese, or mixed. They also come with curtido lightly pickled cabbage salad, and delicious salsa (a think slightly spicy red sauce). I always order mine mixed with a side of rice. 

Each are made to order and I love how each pupusa is $1.50. The restaurant also features some other Salvadorian and Mexican dishes as well, though it's hard for me to pass of a good pupusa! ;)
