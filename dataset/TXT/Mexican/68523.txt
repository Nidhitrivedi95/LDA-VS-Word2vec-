Costal Taco is amazing! My first trip was a night out with friends and their drinks were great and the atmosphere was fun. They have a great view, fun games, and a nice outdoor lounging area. My second trip was a lunch out with work friends and the food was delicious and the seating was great for a big group and everyone in the group was pleased with our meals. They also have great french press coffee and desserts. 

But it was the third and most recent experience that blew me away the most. I reached out to Costal Taco to see if we could cater a fundraising event through them. Their staff was super friendly. They were very helpful and walked me through the whole process.They came into our office to set up a taco bar for our "taco Tuesday" event and we had more than half the office join us for lunch (and most went back for seconds). They set up the lunch room, served the tacos, answered any questions we had, cleaned up, left us some swag and most of all were such a pleasure to work with. I didn't have to lift a finger and it was 100% stress free, which is amazing if you're the planner of the event.

Thanks to Costal Taco we were able to surpass our fundraising goal for our Walk to End Alzheimers team and we could not be more thankful.

Needless to say, Costal Taco has a new #1 fan!! There will be many more trips to come! :)
