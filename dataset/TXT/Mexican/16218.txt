1Dfx3zM-rW4n-31KeC8sJg Tried it for the first time . Place was not busy. Menu is confusing and should  be simplified.  We tried the hard tacis6 . It was flavorless.  I added the elevator Diablo sauce . This had kick . Probably more kick t g an most people  can handle . I tried their steak   quesadilla , it was OK.  Their salsa needed some kink . It was bland so I added the eldiablo  sauce.  Place appeared to be clean
