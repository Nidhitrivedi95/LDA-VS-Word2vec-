9HvMGpZL20cs8YuNfdYBmw Rubio's is one of my favorite restaurants for healthy and fresh food at reasonable prices!   I enjoy their grilled fish entrees and fresh made salsa.  The menu has something for everyone from burritos, tacos to salads - all really tasty! I have visited different locations of Rubio's and there is always consistency in food quality - wish there were a Rubio's in Prescott Az.!
