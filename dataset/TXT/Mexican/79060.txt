CsS9WsonGYyE3vINi5bxSg We booked via open table but it looks like that there was some confusion with the host that I got an email that I did not show up. They were in a hurry to get us out and did not even offer us desserts. It was one of those services that made you feel regret for tipping even just 1%. Food is mediocre, over price and over hype. The kampungki chicken was basically one of those KFC fried chicken from across the street. It did not have the thick spicy red sauce that it should have. Kalbi taco and bulgogi taco are a rip off. It costs $6/taco for 3 bites of meat. If you go to any of the korean restaurant surrounding it, $6 would have gotten you a gigantic place of meat with rice and refillable side dishes.
