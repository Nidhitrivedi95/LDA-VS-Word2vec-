On Friday, 10/30, we arrived here at 5:30 & found it not very busy or espec. friendly.  I ordered the Coasta Cantina chicken special and my partner had a chicken burrito.  The service was lousy because when more & more people arrived, the 2 servers couldn't handle it all.  Everyone in that dining room waited at least 40 minutes for their food and we were told nothing when we inquired.  The bean dip was horrible and almost cold.  My chicken wasn't pink, but thin & transparent.  The sauce of spinach & mushrooms was only warm, & very mediocre.  The burrito was the smallest I've ever seen on a plate & delivered once again with that pitiful bean dip.  Our server never returned to ask if all was well with our food.

The ambiance was 1950's with huge booths that blocked the lovely tall windows.  The lighting was like hitting George Webb's hamburger parlor at 1:00 am, and there was no music emanating from anywhere (which could have helped the mood for sure).

Las Vegas has a huge population of Mexican restaurants, so how this one gets away with even being open is a mystery.
