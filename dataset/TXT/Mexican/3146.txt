-o082vExIs0VVNSuZmiTQA This was a busy night in Old Town. We were really looking for an affordable steak. We chose to enjoy the warm weather and eat in their patio area. We grabbed a drink at the bar but were disappointed that they didn't have any Negra Modelo on hand. The staff was friendly, but didn't see very organized or informed. The host kept telling us that he just put people at tables. After a bit of a wait, we were given a table. After a few minutes, the host requested that we re-position our table to accommodate a group of 17. We then watched as they went through heroic efforts to move tables and change all the chairs. After awhile this plan was abandoned and the party was moved to another room. In the meantime, we read the menu and noticed they didn't have steaks. Steaks were clearly mentioned on their website. At this point we just gave up. We finally had a table and didn't want to go somewhere else and start over again. This was the only dinner we were having in Scottsdale. We ordered a chicken soup and steak fajitas. Both were delicious, especially the soup which came in a generous bowl and was large enough to consider it a meal. The fajitas were good, but no substitute for what we had been craving.
