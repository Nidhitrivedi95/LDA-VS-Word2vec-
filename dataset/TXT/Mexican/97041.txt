eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw This was my second time here and I completely love this spot . Ambience is very casual trendy- you can watch any of the sports game on the television which is a good plus . Staff very friendly , always engage on making my experience better each time I'm there . Let's talk about the food . The quality of their meat , fish is top notch . Menu has variety of options . Not your standard Mexican restaurant I would say . My favorite is the street tacos ( Delish) , the naked chicken wings ( not fried or battered ) actually made with a dry rub and grilled , the lobster dishes on the menu are to die for and did I mention they have a nacho caramel apple pie ? So freaking amazing ! They also have a healthy meal option too and vegan ! I would highly recommend this place for food .
