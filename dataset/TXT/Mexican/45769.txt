But I wasn't impressed with the burritos or the salsas. i thought they were going to be spicy, nothing was spicy. I normally go to Faustos and spend $13.00. This place cost me $21.00 and it was just disappointing. i would spend $22.00 at Rubios (I love ttheir salsas, it's best) anytime, than come back here. My son loves burritos. He throw away half of it. We just didn't like it.
