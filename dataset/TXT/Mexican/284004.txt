xZhNZb01n9b4e2X7bZdoVQ Some of the BEST Mexican that Ive had!!
I travel frequently with my job and I'm lucky enough to get to try different food all over the U.S.
In my opinion, Arizona has the best Mexican restaurants in the U.S. 
Mi Patio is probably the BEST Mexican I've  ever had (in the U.S.) 
To start, the salsa and chips were fragrant, fresh, & warm. The food all came out fresh, correct, ACTUALLY looked better than the pictures on the menu!
Margaritas are delicious, non syrupy, & CHEAP!
The service was quick, friendly, & accurate.
I hope that I will get the opportunity to eat here again in the near future!
