vf-OLMuP-EB1vlqVGUx4CQ Very mediocre all around; never received chips and salsa, ordered combo fajitas which were fair but the steak portion was very overcooked to the point it would not break loose upon biting. Waitress seemed pissed off when I only wanted water to drink and not alcohol. Only reason it's 2 stars and not 1 is the framed O.J. jersey on the wall with the guilty sign stuck to the glass enclosure.
