knWBvogziOE4f82kmmi0sQ We don't live up in this area (we are near the airport), but were visiting Restoration Hardware in Tivoli Village.  
We were very delighted with our lunch experience here.  I approach most restaurants in Vegas with trepidation, as usually the food disappoints for the cost, and service is lacking.  Complete opposite experience here (and yes, I was surprised).
Food was fresh, and Delicious.
Waitress was super friendly and attentive (Melissa).
Rest of staff was "all in" as far as putting on the best appearance.  From the woman that opened the door for us both ways, to all the other support staff, we were very impressed with everyone's attitude.  We would certainly return to this restaurant if we are back in the area.
P.S.  pricing is very reasonable, particularly for an upscale area like Tivoli Village.
