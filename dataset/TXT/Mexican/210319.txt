qME1CvFxSrhqE6-YGcp3Rw I had huevos rancheros, I kinda felt like it was cafeteria food with eggs made from powder and potatoes with peppers that were probably sitting in the kitchen in a pan all morning (mushy). The bloody marys had zero...zero flavor. I might come back for dinner or drinks but brunch is no bueno.
