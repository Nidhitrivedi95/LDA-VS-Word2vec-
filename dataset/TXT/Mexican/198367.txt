p6FPcgLymnpk_gAyQuW_Mw This place is in a liquor store. So its food and booze, who know such genius existed. I got the Arizona/California burrito as usual. I got one taste of it and I was hooked. Ok I know its not really mexican food but it's still good. The guy that was there was really cool and the food was ready in less than 5 minutes. You get a choice of what ever toppings and sauces you want.Next time I got back I'll try the other menu items. He keeps the menu simple which is nice. I'm not standing there for 10 mins trying to pick what to eat. It may look sketch from the outside, but this place is legit.
