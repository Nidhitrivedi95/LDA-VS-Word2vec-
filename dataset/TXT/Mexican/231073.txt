sJHf_8i4iky2yU4-PS1ksQ I had the Gabacha tacos, marinated pork topped with cheese, and it was fantastic! Very flavourful, and nicely spiced.  The pork was served on a bed of grease, with the tortillas served separately in a warmer, along with a variety of sauces and chopped onion in side dishes.  Generous portions too, I had trouble finishing.  

My girlfriend had the Barbacoa, roast shredded beef.  I found her dish to be somewhat bland compared to the Gabacha, but she seemed to enjoy it for the most part.

Complementary guacamole and tortilla chips were good, though i would have liked some pico de gallo with them - but it was free, so I really shouldn't complain ;) 

Service was good overall, and the staff was friendly.  The restaurant was clean, nothing fancy in the decor department though, it had a serve-yourself look, despite the waiter service.  Unlicensed, which is a shame, they might be busier if they served. 

I'll be going again.
