Fxk23pD0vgRa95u1mPQ4tQ Was kind of let down was excited to try based off the Yelp reviews. The service was fast and friendly but the salsa and guac had virtually no flavor our fajitas were just ok. Nothing extraordinary. Don't know if I'd completely rule this place out, but I doubt if I'd go out of my way to eat here again.
