SWDxTrwU_qlEcJp36IYquw Friendly, very tasty, Cuban food. 
We will definitely be back to try the other dishes. 
On this trip we had the "Ropa Vieja" and the "Bistec Uruguayo". We were not disappointed at all. 
No frills location at a strip mall. 
With how the food tasted, they will surely need to expand soon.
