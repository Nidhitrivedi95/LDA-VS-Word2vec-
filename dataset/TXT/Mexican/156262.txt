Kcg5iMwYq5ibBuEhDXKx3Q The decor is fun, especially if you like skulls! Had 3 margaritas: 1 frozen, 1 clear and 1 with grapefruit bitters and forget. They were small by my standards. The frozen was the most like a margarita. The other two were very strong, and not that interesting or...well tasty. Prices a bit high for what you get. The menu was small. Had the guacamole with plantain chips as other reviewers raved. The guacamole was very good as were the chips, and the two work together. Had the jalapenos bombers, too. They were also excellent. However, the portion of guacamole was very small. Had pork shoulder tacos and fish tacos. Tasted good, but batter on fish not great. Again, portions were extremely small. The boozy beans and street corn were had also. Beans okay, not great, small portion. Corn was on the cob and covered in sauce...not fun to eat, taste lacking, too. The staff let you seat yourself. They were very casual and sat around at the empty tables chatting. Our waiter's girlfriend visited for a while and they hugged and kissed right there. (lovely, just not while I am in your restaurant serving me. Felt like we were in their house visiting. Lastly, the music was hip-hop, and if you don't like sexually explicit music, you might ask for, I don't know, maybe some Mexican, ya know? Anyway, All things considered, I wouldn't go back...but I am fussy as have had authentic Mexican, and it is my preference. Adios, muchachas!
