uWrrQ8Rk2uM2WqPMi7EDag Great tacos for a fast food restaurant. The meat was good quality. The tacos were good size. Two tacos were a pretty good portion. Service wasn't great but what can expect from fast food employees working third shift. I ordered the #1 del taco combo which comes with 2 hard shell tacos, fries, and a drink. Was told that the fryer, grill and other appliances were down for the next 2 hours. They gave me nachos and cheese instead of fries and they also gave me tomatoes after I said none. Despite the service quality I would go back.
