z4K95Y4P5nMrtJiDtXWDYA We held my husband's 60th birthday celebration on the patio at Los Sombreros and the evening was nothing short of magical.  Yolanda and Jesus, our servers, were so positive, flexible and accommodating, making sure everything was just right.  Azucena and the kitchen staff produced 24 amazing, hot meals all at once, never missing a beat and topping the evening off with incredible homemade desserts to include caramelized flan, chocolate mousse, chocolate tamale...WOW!  We love the authentic, beautifully prepared food from the guacamole to the Salmon with mango pico de gallo to the Puerco En Chipotle roasted pork in a chipotle-tomatillo sauce.  If you have not experienced Los Sombreros you have missed one of the hidden gems in Scottsdale.
