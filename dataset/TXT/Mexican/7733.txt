_mlFa4uRu3oFUXJghRHttw I was surprised to discover this was the first Mexican restaurant to open in the whole of Scotland. Ever since 1984 they seem to have been refining their speciality frozen margarita as it's a crowd pleaser. The concoction of lime juice, tequila and triple sec seems to be just right, leaving you willing to delve into their Mexican fare.

The food offerings are decent enough with the nice touch of a real salad instead of the usual carrot shavings and a wilted leaf. 

Top stuff!
