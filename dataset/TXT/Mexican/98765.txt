ERM603jbIbNqX2c7Ww1Qiw Went to Cafe Rio tonight with the family for Taco Tuesday. It was busy, but not THAT many people. I don't know if they were short staffed or what, but they needed to speed up the process. Took forever. Also the trash cans were overflowing. I know it's a busy day since it's Taco Tuesday, but it happens every week. Have more staff that night. 

The food was great, but we were easily waiting 20 minutes just to order. Loved the sweet pork. Can't beat a free kids quesadilla too!

Made a trip the the ladies room while I was there and noticed the trash can blocks the diaper changing station. Might want to relocate that to another space so someone could actually use the changing station.
