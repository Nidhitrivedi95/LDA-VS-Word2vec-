B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA 10/10 would eat again. Prices are reasonable for the amazing product, it's roughly equivalent to what you're used to paying for a sushi roll wherever you're from. Also enjoyed done kimchi on the side which is fabulous, great balanced flavor. Ate firecracker, catapillar and angry tuna burritos with my wife. Check it out for sure whether you're on the strip or not.
