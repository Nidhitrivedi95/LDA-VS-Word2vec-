It's just a few mirachi band hats hanging on the walls with a few old pictures and jazzy/frank sinatra music playing, no mexican classics.  You'd think it would be at least a little bit of Day of the Dead themed with some sugar skulls as decor but i guess it's supposed to be family friendly.  So I sit at the bar, no napkins or utensils, had to ask.  The drink menu is small with beer and wine, not really any specialty drinks like bulldogs/beer-garitas.  The Piscado (fish tacos) was alright.  It was served with a lemon not a lime.  My napkin gets take away.  Asked for another napkin with a fork and spoon.  Beef brisket burritos was alright, almost dry but didnt taste like beef brisket.  Out of all, it was alright, it dosnt have enough authenticy for me.  I'd prefer Playa Cabana on Dupont and Davenport.  This is the first place I've seen that doesn't have El Jimador.
