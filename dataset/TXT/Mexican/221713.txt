ROuiI7sWhEMLodSylU2Qpg The food is overpriced. We ordered barbacoa dinner platters incl drinks for two ppl $24. Food was not bad, not great either, I've tasted better. the flour tortillas were undercooked. One of the workers was rude and was complaining about a chip on the floor that she had to sweep up. Uh isn't that her job to do?
