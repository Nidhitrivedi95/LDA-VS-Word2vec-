6XpqswYWoSOx0a9MkosVRA The proximity to the train park and being Mexican food sealed the deal for us on this visit. I met a friend at the train park and we hopped on over at lunchtime. I was bummed there was no shade outside to sit with our kids-- so they could roam and we could semi enjoy a few bites between chasing them. No fault of the restaurant, but could've been solved by a number of umbrellas.

The food prices were okay... $9-$12 for lunch and $7 for kid meals (which I thought was about $1-2 overpriced). They had a limited menu for lunch, but the offerings were fine. 

I'm a vegetarian, so while "authentic" Mexican food sounds appealing, they do in fact use lard in their refried beans (which is obvi what makes them so good I'm sure but I can't vouch for that) and chicken stock in the rice. So once again, I was left with the ever-so-exciting side of black beans with my enchiladas (because no other options were veggie-friendly). I asked if the enchiladas were vegetarian and the reply, was, "yeah, just cheese." 

They arrived and there was a large piece of what looked like chicken in my enchilada (that was already super soggy and drenched with sauce and cheese). I'm not sure there was a tortilla under there, to be honest. I pushed it aside and ate beans for lunch.

Their saving grace were the chips and salsa that were perfectly thin and tasty. Iced tea was $3 (crazy because the margin was at least 98% on that) and the side of sour cream for my son's quesadilla was $1. The kid quesadillas were deep fried, it seemed, as the tortilla was completely drenched in oil. My kids split a meal and it was plenty large enough for them to do so given their ages (ages 3, 5), so that was nice. The drink options were slim for kids and no milk. 

I think we'll stick to picnic lunches or eating at the train park from here on out.
