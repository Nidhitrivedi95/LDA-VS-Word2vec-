NjDC1Evc2Wa6ykj8xVpoUw First time in a long time I recieved a very great experience ordering my food. Brianna H., was very friendly, i was actually recommended something and offered drinks and a side.. Usually I don't get a happy cashier or any sort of recommendations. Definitely try the Shredder Sandwich!!
