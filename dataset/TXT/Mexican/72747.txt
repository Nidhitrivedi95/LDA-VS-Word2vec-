Cd2ERofxOeCbCi-0yDs0aw Super hungry and looking for something to eat, I came across this little gem. I had my family with me so we all ordered something different. I went with the green chili chimichanga. The green chili was delicious, tasty and spicy enough for me! Everyone else loved their food as well. I will definitely be coming back :)

Other food: carne asada fries, quesadilla and the #1...all very good.

Only thing missing was my rice and beans but the chimi itself made up for it.

Definitely recommend this place!
