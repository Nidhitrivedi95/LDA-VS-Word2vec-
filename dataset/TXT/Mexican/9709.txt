_WtxQbDK7B-ExGdeG-2j6Q Everyone in the "know" in Phoenix knows about the Rokerji / Richardsons. This place serves the best southwestern food hands down. Ask Esquire magazine, who awarded them best bar in America. And of course Phoenix Mag gives their nod to this place almost every year. These 2 restaurants occupy the same real estate but the Rokerji is in the basement and it is my personal favorite. The atmosphere is 5 stars. Big sofas, large booths in a Grotto like setting with a roaring fire. It doesn't get any better than this. The menu is the same whether you choose to stay up top at Richardsons or go down below to the basement. The food is hands down the best of its kind in town. Now if you are heat sensitive, listen to your server. The owner of these places means it when he says "spicy" but it's oh so worth the pain. My favorite here is the Carne Adovada with an egg on top. It is unforgettable. The egg is the magic touch to me with this dish. They tend to have this more on the breakfast side but don't let that deter you. You can have them add the egg anytime. The richness of the warm yolk melding into this dish sends it over the top. Trust me you will absolutely love it. I give The Rokerji / Richardsons 5 stars in spite of some of the tired burned out staff members. Unfortunately some of the servers here have forgotten the true meaning of being in the service industry.  It is my feeling that the owner, Richardson, needs to remind his staff that there is 3 parts to a great dining experience. The ambiance, the fantastic food and the SERVER.  But for now overlook the occasional subpar server and give this place a try. It will become one of your favorite spots right after your first mouthwatering bite.
