1ZJz840L496LAmQdeDv0WA Everything we ordered was prepared and tasted perfectly.

The Mexican corn on the cob was excellent. The corn was sweet and the toppings were in perfect proportion.

The chips were homemade just right and the salsa was a delicious complement.

Although I loved everything, my favorite part of my meal was the carne asada taco. The meat was great, tender and well-seasoned, but the highlight was the handmade corn tortillas. Whooo-weee! So soft and light. Totally made my taco!

I can't wait to get back to Pinches!
