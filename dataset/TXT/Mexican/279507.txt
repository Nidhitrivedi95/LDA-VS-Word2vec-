xUvgrDdKhcmaP6Zv0ssb6A The food was great, well what little bit of that there was, and our server was on point with refills and checking in on us.  The wife and I ordered the fajitas for 2 and they were great, but they seriously had like ten pounds of vegetables on them and had hardly any meat.  Did not like paying close to $40 dollars to leave hungry when even Chili's offers more meat on their fajitas.
