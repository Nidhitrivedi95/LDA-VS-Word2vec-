lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw I really enjoyed dinner here on 4/18/16 with friends. It was a Monday night and not busy at all. We had the option of dining inside or on the patio. The patio is really nice but it was a little chilly so we sat indoors. Great atmosphere whether inside or outside.

I was happy to see a vegan portion of the menu although I did not order from it. Maybe next time! We received our drinks and chips and salsa promptly after we sat down from our friendly, attentive waiter. We also had free guacamole from checking in. All was delicious. When it was time to order entrees, our server was knowledgeable about the menu and had recommendations. Two of us ordered the Achiote Chicken Street Tacos ($14), one ordered the Al Pastor Pork Street Tacos ($16), and one ordered the Breakfast Burrito ($12) with green sauce. Everything was really good. My only complaint is more pickled veggies and lime wedges! I like to load street tacos up with spicy carrots and lime. But no worries, our server brought me out some extra when I asked.

We all left completely stuffed and I even had leftovers. I think the price is fair for a nice, sit-down Mexican dinner. Will be back soon :)
