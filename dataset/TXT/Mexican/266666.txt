WGkqfp1-3130v8xhCb3APg Really good chicken burrito. El biggo chx with hot sauce, no sour with vegan guacamole. I have ordered this several times and I'm always pleased. The steak burrito on the other hand isn't good at all. It's not steak, more of a beef roast. Hence a reduction in a star. I'll be back again to try some specials for sure.
