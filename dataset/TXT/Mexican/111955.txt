G4hjhtA_wQ-tSOGpgGlDjw We had the Camaron Enchilado, and it was just as advertised, if not better. We also had  the Shrimp Tostada's and the first thing that you taste is this lemony/citrusy flavor followed by a kick if spice when biting into the shrimp. You have an option to have ayour shrimp raw or cooked. W chose to cooked, and might I say it was amazing! The horchata is homemade and taste just like arros con leche (Rice & milk), a Mexican dessert dish. All in all my experience here was great!
