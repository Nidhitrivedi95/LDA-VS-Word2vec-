EP1do6l8hLyIGEru0gN3EQ Why can't we give half stars?!?! If we could, this place would fall at a 2.5. I didn't feel that it warrants at 2, but is just below a three... Luckily the rounding up factor worked in their favor.

I went to JM's on Saturday night for a friend's birthday dinner. The building and ambiance are a great for drinks with friends. The food leaves some to be desired. It blew my mind how one side of the menu was "Mexican" and the other was of a variety of Asian cuisine with zero fushion of the two. This restaurant literally sits on top of the Iron Curtain between east and west popular dishes.

 As with most restaurants in this part of the country, I'd stick with the Asian side of the menu. The "Mexican" side lacks flavor and authenticity (I suppose the Asian side might as well, but I am far more experienced with quality and authentic Mexican cuisine). I had the pad thai and I would recommend it for anyone dining at JMs. Don't bother with the fried tofu. It sounds good, but is just big hunks of tufu fried. It would be much enjoyable if the tofu was cut into smaller portions before being fried.

Overall, come here for some drinks with friends and have a bite to eat if you are or get hungry. Don't bring a huge group as the restaurant just really isn't set-up for it.
