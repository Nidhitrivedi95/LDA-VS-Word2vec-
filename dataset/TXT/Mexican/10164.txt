_XN-GwzZwAyIqLKJsl2htg Our experience was a bit of a mixed bag. We all went with the Restaurant Week menu, chicken and carne asada were very good but I'd recommend the chef back off the lime in the sauce with the beef though. My wife's salmon in a soyish broth disappointed however. She eats salmon everywhere all the time including my own on the grill so she knows her some fish. So, I'd say 3 out of 4 positives. The taco apps were tasty yet small. My wife's sushi roll lacked zing, I tried it, nothing special. Rice pudding, the only dessert available, I thought was great!
Aside from the fare, this place, on a Friday night, was LOUD! First you crank crappy music up real loud so you can barely tell what song it is through the  distortion. Add a dense crowd of Scottsdale guys and gals, squawking at each other over the mush of the sound system and you have a less than ideal dining experience. Some reviews call this phenomenon, energy. 
It's a place where the vapid can commingle with the self-absorbed while enjoying some pretty tasty fare. SumoMaya's fusion of Latin & Asian ingredients throughout the menu is mighty impressive and would be worth a return but the crowd and the sound system were much harder to stomach.
