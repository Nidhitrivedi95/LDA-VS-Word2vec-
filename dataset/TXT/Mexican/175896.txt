MQEpDvkdL39hh1N0We3Vaw Honestly I cannot review this place because we haven't tasted their food yet but just got inside and were told the wait time was an hour !!!! Okay, one hour seriously?? There were only 3 to 4 parties in the waiting area though, okay I don't know and not judging. But still, our first impression was not that good. Usually I don't see much crowd there and also not great reviews so far. So we decided to give it a shot on a Tuesday night when they serve $2 tacos. Probably that's why the wait time was an hour. Whatever.
