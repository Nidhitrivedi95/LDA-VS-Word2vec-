wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ When Mi Pueblo was new it was where I bought burritos to feed my friends as we tried to transform my big ugly old house into something better than it ever was in its century on my block. Thru the years that followed I ate many a time at Mi Pueblo never once regretting a thing. Later years found me dividing my life between northern Ohio and southern California.

Southern California means two things when it comes to eating out. The first is more fast food chains than any place on earth. Second is Mexican food every where. Unlike native Californians I reached super saturation with both.

I sold my house in California and spend most of my time in Ohio staying away from Mexican and fast food.  For the past few months I come home late twice a week and frequently prefer not to cook. I get carry out along the way home. Tonite I decided to return to an old haunt and got a carnitas burrito from Mi Pueblo.

It was amazingly good. In California pork dishes are loaded with fat. At Chipotle the burrito is filled with rice and corn. Mi Pueblo is nothing but chunks of lean juicy pork with a minimal amount of typical Mexican garnishes. It easily out weighs a B spot burger or a Bogtrotters sandwich and is 1/3 cheaper. I was hesitant to return since I have read many negative reviews recently. I am here to add my Hoorays to offset at least one bad review.
