QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA I had an early lunch at Nacho Daddy and I was pleasantly surprised how yummy my tortilla soup and how fresh my kale salad was. I had good service from my host Jaylen and my server wasn't bad either, I think she may have been new. I think this is good spot to take friends or eat by yourself. My only compliant is the music was a little loud for my taste. Overall I would defiantly eat here again.
