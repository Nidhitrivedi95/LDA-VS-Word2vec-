LnsAgGlvIPmc9eV_cMdU5w So lovely! Food was wonderful- complex, fresh, and very authentic. Our server was kind and helpful. A little low on vegetarian options, and the place is quite small, but not poorly laid out, just cozy. Plus, there's old black and white El Santo movies playing (without sound) near the register! A fantastic option in a neighbourhood mostly bereft of wallet-and-palate friendly food.
