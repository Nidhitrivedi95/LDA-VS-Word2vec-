DfD-xc8788c081WiFjluTA This was my first time at Tijuana Flats and I think I'm just not impressed with the concept as a whole. The staff were friendly and the place was clean - but those are the only redeeming qualities. 

Things I didn't love...

1. The queso was yellow and bland - kinda tasted like Velvetta. 
2. The mix of counter service and table service was strange. I don't understand why a counter service place puts the soda fountain behind the counter. 
3. I'm confused about why meals come with chips but nothing to dip them in. No salsa or anything. And the hot sauce bar wasn't cutting it. 
4. The food was just bland and boring - the chicken was chewy and the carnitas were dry.
