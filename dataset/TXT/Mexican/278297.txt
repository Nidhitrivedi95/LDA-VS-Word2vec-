XMrLwzmEAsfNpbKRC7vUzQ This could easily have been a terrible review. But thanks to our server (Darien-sp?) it was very enjoyable. 6 of us checked in at 6:55 and were told 20-25 minute wait. We saw MANY empty tables but still waited. Finally at the 45 minute mark, we were ready to leave. Our table was ready (one of the many we had seen) right then so we decided to stay. Darien explained to us that there were only 3 servers in a packed house tonight and that he appreciated our patience. From that point on, it was excellent! He took very good care of us, in spite of being run ragged, and the food (most of us had wings) was delicious. Mis-management is the only reason this review is not 5 star.
