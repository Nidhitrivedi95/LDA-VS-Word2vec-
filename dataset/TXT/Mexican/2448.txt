-iBk1_3M_efQtY6Bcygp5w I'm thrilled I can share my new discovery of a little mexican joint with you all. It's  located inside the boulder station casino near the bigger restaurants... not the food court.

A few weeks ago my hub and I were desperate for food that wasn't fast food or sit down. We happen to stumble upon viva salsa which has a cheap and simple menu so we decided to try it.

I ordered the chicken taco plate, which includes rice, refried beans and the usual taco fixings + drink 5.99. My hub had the burrito plate that included the same sides + drink 5.99. In a nutshell we had a really delicious and fresh hot meal for under $13 that hit the spot on hunger and wallet.

The only small down side is we waited in line for about 20 minutes till we could order, but the food came out quicker than expected. Yay! I love this little taco joint and if you give it a try I'm sure you'll love it too!
