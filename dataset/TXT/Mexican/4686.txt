-TWZ4-AM76pUxPIt47mInw The food here is different from what I expected. The queso dip was a lukewarm congealed mess of what appeared to be mozzarella cheese and watered down Alfredo. The Ketzel burrito I tried had the same watered down Alfredo type sauce on it, It was called white sauce on the menu. This "white sauce" is not good, and considering they drenched my poor burrito with it, as well as my friends quesadilla. The service was excellent except the table was asked how everything was by just about every employee on premises. It actually got to the point where their constant query's were a interruption.
