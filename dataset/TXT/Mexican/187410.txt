O1ird5yRyuDFnOmYu90OoA Came here on a Tuesday night for dinner and the dining area was not too crowded. When you walk in, there is a bar and then in the back is a small dining area. The restaurant has a cool vibe. 

We started off with their roja salsa and chips. Their chips are homemade and the salsa had a nice tang. They also refill the chips, which was great. I had the mahi mahi taco and my friend had the shrimp gobernador taco. My other friends had the burritos. 

Our food came out pretty quickly. The burritos were huge. The mahi mahi tacos had a nice slaw and crema, so they were pretty filling. The shrimp tacos did not have as much filling, but were yummy. 

Since we were celebrating a birthday, we split an order of churros at the end. They put a candle in the churros, which was a nice touch. The churros were nice and warm, but had an interesting filling. Overall, a great place to grab some tacos or burritos with reasonable prices. Would love to come back in the summer and check out their patio.
