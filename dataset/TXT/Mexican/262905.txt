vz8HFGsITt6aj-nyXkAEFg BE AWARE: MY WALLET WAS PICKED OUT OF MY PURSE, SUNDAY 6:30PM 6-5-16. The inside chairs are high and easy to hang a purse on. We were in a party of six and chose to sit inside. There were flies around and we were not comfortable from the onset. We keep thinking we should have left at that time.

There was a Hispanic women about 40 yrs old, about 170 lbs with a very, very heavy set white man with red hair at the table next to us. This is key, since we have since read out on the Police Blotters sites that other victims have reported the seeing a a couple with the same close to them. 

The tables are very close here. You will have a hard time moving your chairs, and not bumping the neighboring table. I noticed my wallet was gone when I pick up my purse to leave. Checked with the manager and receptionist, no wallet was turned in. My head was spinning and then started to think, maybe it was at the condo we are renting. Upon returning to the condo, no wallet was there, and we began to make calls and canceled all the cards. 

Never put your purse on the chair. On you lap is best. When the food arrived the beans and shrimp were cold. So that was disappointing. The chips and salsa were good. But I think as we were diving into the chips, the theft occurred. 

We have reported this to the police. At this point I am rethinking my purse type and looking at getting a wallet that is tethered to to the purse or purse wallet combo that goes cross body. We are vacationing from Seattle. But I have keep passport card separate from my wallet. So we are a bit shaken, but ok. Hope this saves you the same pain.
