VRwT0pscR5vESCrAnUpNwQ Wilbur Mexicana has the best chips and guacamole that I've ever had. "Guac is extra?" Not here, where guac comes in heaping portions next to crunchy and tasty chips. I think about them often. 

The atmosphere at Wilbur is awesome; the art on the walls showcases their levels of spice that you can get in your meal and they were playing fun, alternative music when I dined there, lending to the atmosphere. I had a salad, which is not typical Mexican food fare, but it was delicious with grilled pineapple and roasted, spicy chickpeas. My friend had a burrito 'the size of her face' and loved it. Service was friendly and casual.

An excellent place for lunch in a great location. And those chips, goodness, those chips.
