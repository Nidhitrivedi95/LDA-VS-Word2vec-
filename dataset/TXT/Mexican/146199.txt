JJe0yIYC_M3la1Qbm9i3UQ What can I say about this place? It feels like home from the moment you walk in. Moe treats everyone like a regular and it seems like he remembers you even if you've only been in a couple of times. Mallory is a fantastic bartender too. She's funny, keeps up a good conversation and makes a mean drink. Speaking of drinks, I'm not a big beer drinker but the dunkelweizen is on point and I'll have it every time. And don't forget the food. I've only seen a menu on Taco Tuesday but the kitchen also cooks up solid steaks, schnitzel, pork chops, and I'm pretty sure whatever else they feel like on any given night. Make sure you get some grumpy sauce for your fries if they have it.
