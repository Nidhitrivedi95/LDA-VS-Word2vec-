jIzygnVmajEXYmfsBNY_Gw Some truly great tacos and burritos here!  I drive here from Goodyear about twice a month but it would probably be every week if I lived closer  The food is always delicious and unless they have run out of their awesome pinto beans for burritos, I always leave satisfied and full! 

I love their assortment of meats that include; tinga, chicken, pastor, cochinita pibil, cream chicken, carnitas, carne asada, and barbacoa.
