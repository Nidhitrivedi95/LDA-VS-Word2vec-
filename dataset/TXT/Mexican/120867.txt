H-PHxkHgehukPQgb3yF9Xw My experience is solely based on the food order i got thru one of the delivery companies, ordered the chilli cheese fries along with a steak burrito! The fries were heavenly and the portion could feed 2 easily, the burrito  on the other hand was gigantic. Too bad the rice was 98% of the filling along with some hints of cilantro if you imagined it to be there, would've liked more, sour cream barely there, beef, well let's just say in half a burrito i ate i felt maybe 3 chunks! Order the fries they are good, piping hot and flavourful but the burrito go to other competitors .  Did not see the location's inside yet. Can't vouch for seating, service etc
