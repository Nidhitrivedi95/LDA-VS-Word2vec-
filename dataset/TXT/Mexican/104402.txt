fdS9moyk-R84-DgY5xrCRg I've been impressed with the variety, flavors and food here so I do keep on coming back. However, I have to say that the service has been disappointing me more and more lately. There is no longer any excuse that orders (for my past 3 visits) are made and placed wrong, and while I understand being a new restaurant, that the menu and recipe will change... but the consistency has been lacking - and I find myself surprised each time eating here, not knowing what to expect. Also, to the new staff up front, please check your attitude in serving customers.  To customers - If the manager is not around, be wary.

I do love the food here but the service needs to get better.
