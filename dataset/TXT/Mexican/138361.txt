IyrDnrvUKpndj5zIv1KvGQ Worst tamales i have ever had.  We went and ordered the special, tamales with beans and rice.  The tortilla chips and dip they bring out is nice, but it took them quite some time to get the food ready.  The tamales were dry, certainly not cooked the same day, the rice was bland and overcooked.  And all that covered with bad sauce and heated up it a microwave most likely... Because the plates themselves were as hot as the food.  Never going back, not recommending.  Vegas has much better places than that.
