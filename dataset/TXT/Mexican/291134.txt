ySkrz264l39YRcZ2-48C1g This place is terrible with their customer service & portion consistency. Ordered three bowls of the same meat (barbacoa) & they were all different in amount; the employee Evelyn used the bottom of the batch, giving the last bowl hardly any meat & majority of it just juice. When asked to even the amount, she said, "You already have a lot. Do you want double?" I explained how the meat was skimped on the last one, but she only told me the same thing. It was clear the first two bowls had more than the last. The other food assemblers were rude when I asked for extra lettuce, & the cashier didn't even smile. My bowl was drowned in juices, hardly any rice, & all together it was a terrible experience.

It's sad because Chipotle is one of my favorite fast-casual dining to go to, but I will never come back to this location again.
