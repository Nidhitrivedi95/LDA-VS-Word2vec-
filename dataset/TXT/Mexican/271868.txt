wrVKiNlNI3xE302fDbrVBw My first time trying this place, I got a spicy chicken burrito bowl for take-out as I was running late. The total was about $9.

The Good:
- Super friendly service, the guys were pleasant
- The spicy chicken tasted alright

The Bad:
- Crunchy rice, inedible
- Bit into a piece of chicken gristle
- Poor value (in terms of amount and quality of ingredients) compared to other burrito places
- Very little sauce

Overall:
- Not good. I barely ate this and wasn't satisfied at all. I'm a regular at so many other burrito places, this one bites the dust. 
- I only dropped by here because of the crazy rain storm. Likely never to try again.
