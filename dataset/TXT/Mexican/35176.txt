My go-to's are the chicken especial burritos and the two classic chicken taco plate. The plate comes with chips and pinto beans. 

They have a signature chipotle cream sauce that I get every. single. time. I insist on trying it! 

I've also had great experiences with staff at this location. I had to wait a little while once and they gave me a free taco coupon and a free side of guac. I must say that when they don't give it to you for free, it is costly. It's $1.25 for a small (salsa side) guac. 

The salsa bar is amazing. They have a wide variety of salsas. Usually, by the time you are done filling up on salsa, your food is ready. It's awesome. 

5 stars in my opinion!
