gwd1W_0Mgzqo3QxgXrt16Q RuRu's is such a fun spot. Their patio is gorgeous - the interior is relatively average. Their drinks are STELLAR: good size, good flavor, good price. We each got two and loved them all.

The food is quite good. The guacamole was very good. They don't quite have as many vegetarian options as I was hoping, BUT the one tofu taco that they have is incredible. I could eat a whole plate of them, so I guess it's not a huge loss for the lack of variety. My dining companion had the mushroom quesadilla and really liked that as well. I got a salad to accompany my taco and it was pretty flat. Not great lettuce, not that many toppings. But I did like the honey lime dressing.

All in all, this is a great spot and I'll be back soon.
