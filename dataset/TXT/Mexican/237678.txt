SXr6ByM7UmUQ55qtOUMijg When we walked in there were 8 people standing around and no one offered to help serve us. They were out of beans, rice, and fajitas. They lied about remaking all of our food that got cold while we had to wait around for the rest of it to be cooked. They told us to sit down and they would remake it yet the food we were served was ice cold. I will never be back to this chipolte. I would suggest others to not come to this location.
