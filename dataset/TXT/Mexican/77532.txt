cKgUCzMGuRgkbKXUsgeXUw This is definitely mexican food for white people. Bright lights, cartoony dia de los meurtos skulls and pomegranate seeds in the guac just scream inauthentic.

HOWEVER, the food was very good. The portions were small so I would judge this as overpriced but overall the meal was enjoyable. The service was decent considering it was a very busy night during spring training.
