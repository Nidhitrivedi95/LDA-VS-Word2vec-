TH6mQqMfKATGjuW9SfoVSg I've eaten here many times, simply because they are open late and the employees are very nice. The food however, no matter what I order (nachos, enchiladas, burritos), always skates by at an "acceptable" level. The guacamole is a runny sauce which has no resemblance taste-wise to an avocado. Many times the food is greasy and unflavorful. I would eat here again if there were no other options but it's nothing great. I'm not really sure how someone could rate them 5 stars, because there are many many great mexican restaurants out here.
