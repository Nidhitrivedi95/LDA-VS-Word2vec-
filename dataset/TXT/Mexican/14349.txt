0vdw9E5zzYDNsW_smjBmHA We had to run an errand in Chandler and were looking for breakfast. I checked Yelp and found El Sol. I had the chorizo, egg and potato breakfast burrito and my husband had the bacon, egg and potato burrito. Both were huge and delicious, wrapped in a homemade flour tortilla, YUM! But the kicker was the salsa and the chips made from homemade corn tortillas. 

They do a brisk takeout business but they have 9 small tables if you want to eat in. The service was as great as the food. I was a little bummed because we live in Surprise and it's an hour away. Then they told us about Burritoholics (little bit closer) and we can't wait to try it. Right now, I'm wishing I'd bought some tortilla chips and salsa to bring home.
