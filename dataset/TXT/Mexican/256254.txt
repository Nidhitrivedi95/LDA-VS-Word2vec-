Small, unassuming place in a strip mall. Inside casual, yet refined. 

We started out with the potato taquito things as an appetizer. Because I'm obsessed with potato tacos and have a hard time finding them in AZ although they are everywhere in California. They were delicious, especially with the trio of hot sauces they bring to your table.

My husband has a combo plate that had steak, a cheese enchilada, beans, rice. He thought it was very tasty. I tasted the cheese enchilada and was blown away about how delicious the sauce was.

I had the chili relleno. It was very good but I'm very picky with my chili rellenos. So it wasn't my favorite. But after tasting my husband's enchilada, I am definitely getting those next time!

Service was great. Warm, laid- back, and friendly. We will defintely be back!
