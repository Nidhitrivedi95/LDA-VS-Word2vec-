fK1oj0dk9Bc6KsBk5mMDxg We visited the restaurant for the first time with our friends on Saturday. They had been there before and recommended it. The overall experience was ok, and food was the best part.

The place is way too loud: it was packed and the music was very loud. I did not hear a thing what the waitress said about the tacos that she served. I event felt that it was too embarrassing to ask what it is for the third time. The tables were quite small but we still had to shout to our friends on the other side.

We had to ask several times when are we going to get the tacos we ordered. Our friends had already finished their meal when we got the last tacos. The waiters did not seem to know what we were having either and there was a lot of confusion.

I found our waiter a bit arrogant too. Actually one of the rudest that I've met in Toronto. We just paid 160 dollars, you don't have to be rude to us, okay.

And what is the point of playing the music so loud?
