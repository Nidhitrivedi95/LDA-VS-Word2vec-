mqqpu_OBoaQmtA4wFfG-Yg I go to Ztejas for the tasty Chambord Margarita.  I ordered a Achiote chicken chopped salad which included diced avocados,tomatoes,black beans, Cotija cheese,roasted corn, pumpkin seeds, bacon,iceberg and red cabbage,tossed table side with ranch vinaigrette for $12.75. I definitely recommend.
