OMEbwr0Aybw_wnqvno-6zQ Retro, energetic and fun. Chuy's is a blast from the past. 

Kara, our server, was very good and patient with us newbies. The Chips and salsa starter is pretty tasty. The chips were warm and very light. And the salsa has a nice little kick. 

I was hungry so I went with the chicken burrito. With burritos, you can pick your sauce. I'd sugguest taking the sauce your online ahead of time so you don't hold others in your party up. There are several, maybe five or six to choose from. Kara had to help me.  I went with the deluxe tomatillo sauce. Excellent choice. It was a creamy white sauce; I wasn't in the mood for a red sauce after salsa. 

Burritos are HUGE! They come with a choice of rice. I selected Mexican rice. The dish was very tasty. It was just too large even for my hunger status. I probably finished about 3/4 of it before waving the white flag.
