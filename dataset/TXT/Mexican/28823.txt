3u5el8pjsc6igwPlls0_6Q I went here today and the place formerly known as Wadaa Street Tacos has changed its name, so I'm just going to repost my review from the other name....

I'm a fan of authentic street tacos and this is a great place to get them. They grill the meat right in front of you, so the whole place smells great when you walk up. The tacos are tasty and I can easily eat 4 or 5 for lunch. It's truly just a hole in the wall, and there is no place to sit, so be prepared to find a spot on the sidewalk or take your food somewhere else.

Oh, and don't get the red sauce on your fingers and then rub your eye or you'll be looking for an eyewash station pretty fast, LOL.

P.S. I'll bet these tacos taste even better after a night out at the clubs in the area!

Oh, and for those complaining that the tacos are expensive maybe you should look around and recognize that you're in Scottsdale, not the avenues!
