9ehTNgvu0vZgHjWkQqF6KQ Dead Mouse Anyone?? 

Imagine taking your daughter for her 16th birthday to dinner with 24 people! Bill comes to $500 ish and you find that your kids are playing with a dead mouse in the room your eating! Yep! That's what happened tonight! Disgusting! When we tried talking to the "supervisor" she proceeded to say $20 off my bill?? $20 are you crazy? Free not necessary but $20?? Then when we go to leave you follow us out to take pictures of our cars to report us? Well we will be reporting you to yelp, channel 5, 13, 8 oh and the health department! Thanks for the memorable 16th for my kid!

Ps.... Ceaser was an amazing waiter! He was the good part of the experience and the guy who walked out with us!
