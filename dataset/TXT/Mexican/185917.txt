nWD8OWd_DAXGubGpFenmiw The reviews for this place seem confusing, as it only has 2 stars. I want to clear something up:

If you are coming for MEXICAN FOOD you will likely be unimpressed and give it a low rating.

If you are coming for PATIO DRINKS AND MARGARITAS, you will likely get drunk and get your money's worth, therefore, giving a higher rating.

This is one of thinly places in the city that does a proper margarita and doesn't charge you an arm and leg for a drink with actual tequila in it. 

Before you go for Mexican, read the reviews thoroughly. La Hacienda pumps out great drinks and they have an incredible patio. You do the math...food will taste better when you're drunk and can linger.
If you want to have trendy braised meat tacos (which are yummy, don't get me wrong) and be kicked out of your seat after an hour and only one cocktail, go elsewhere. personally, I prefer the former.
