qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A I was super excited to come here for brunch today!  The reviews had all been great, and there were lots of things I wanted to try!  Unfortunately, I left somewhat disappointed.
After arriving, our server asked if we wanted a starter.  I eagerly ordered the white chocolate and blueberry scones - and was told that the pastry person last night did not prepare enough, so they were only available if one ordered the pastry basket, and not on their own.  Neither of us wanted the chocolate croissant, so no scones for us.  We proceeded to order our meals, a roasted pork omelet and a roasted veggie omelet.  These came with bread - I ordered an English muffin and my friend ordered brioche toast.
My omelet was good, not great, and I asked for salsa to liven it up.  My grind enjoyed her omelet.  We didn't get any butter for the bread, but it was brought when we asked.  When I went to butter my "English muffin", I realized that it was NOT AN ENGLISH MUFFIN!  It was a hamburger bun cut into the size of an English muffin and toasted.  Seriously.  I tried to eat it, but it really wasn't worth it.  When I told our server, he told me that they had a new bread supplier, and it probably was just a different brand.  When he looked at it, he realized that it truly was a hamburger bun.  He apologized, but did not offer anything to correct it.  
We ordered the chicken and waffles next, and those were great - wish we had started lthere.  Overall, an OK experience, but a lot of excuses, no scones, and an awful substitute for an English muffin.  I may return and give it another shot, but for now, I will stick to an occasional business lunch here.
