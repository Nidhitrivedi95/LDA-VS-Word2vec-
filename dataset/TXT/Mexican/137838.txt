Iu2ZINWwyrt9gXliykBEKQ Some of the best Mexican food I've ever had. (Should be 5 stars, but:) Some of the stupidest customer service decisions I've ever experienced. Located in downtown Toronto so plenty of business people undoubtedly frequent the place. Often business people can be reimbursed for their meal, as was the case for our group who were all attending a conference nearby, but Milagro refused to give us separate cheques. They claimed their system couldn't do it. We suggested pretending we were sitting at different tables. They still wouldn't do it. The next day I came back and upfront strongly requested separate cheques, citing my dissatisfaction with the previous day's experience. They did it that time! Which I was grateful for, but I'm not a fan of being lied to.
