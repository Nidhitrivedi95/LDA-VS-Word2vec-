VIJ2KiDKhUVhhpNylEIfog If you're in the mood for a burrito but want something more authentic (and less crowded) than Chipotle, Maize is a great choice. My favorite meat is the pastor -- it's got a lot of flavor, and it meshes well with the rest of the ingredients in the burrito. The homemade tortilla chips are good too, though not quite salty enough for my tastes. The red salsa that comes in the takeout bag isn't that good, but the other salsa you get if you dine in is better. Speaking of dining in, don't. There are a total of about 15 seats, and they're so tightly packed together that just getting to one is difficult if you aren't 2D. Just get your food to go and save yourself the trouble.
