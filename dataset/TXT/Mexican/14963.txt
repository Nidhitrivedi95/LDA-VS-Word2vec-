1-EjdZhVZFuNG6ReBS0rvQ I've come here multiple times and loved this place. The last two times I've come there has been a hair in my food. I thought maybe it was just a one time thing so we came back again, there was a hair in not one but TWO things I ordered. In our appetizer and my margarita. I am completely turned off from this place I can't say I will be back.
