ms7cmWkPiSBDTnz-1sv2kQ Ordered a shredded chicken burrito (through Postmates, so I'm setting aside any temperature or sogginess-related issues here.)

Unnerving: there were peas in my burrito... but only about three of them, which seems less like a bad culinary decision and more of an absurdist prank. Where did those come from? And despite the description of "chipotle crema" and "avocado crema," it seemed more likely that somebody slathered the burrito in mayonnaise before rolling it up. Gnarly. I didn't request any salsa, but I imagine if it had been included it would have just been ketchup.

If "Mexican food from a middle-class Michigan suburb" is the style of food you're looking for, this is definitely the place!
