7T2Dx26gYKPMFmAWwHgnOA Oh my goodness! Yelp has smiled upon my taste buds once again. I searched for lunch in this area while my boyfriend and I were waiting on our car and we walked up to Habanero's just in time. After we put in our order all these people showed up behind us! We sat outside and waited probably less than ten minutes for our food. Based on what I read I ordered the carnitas burrito, my bf got a carne asada, blackened fish, and blackened chicken taco. To drink, horchata for us both! 

Before I dug in I tried a piece of chicken that had fallen out of his taco onto the plate. Seriously, some of the softest most tender chicken I've ever had. My burrito was perfect and the guac inside sent me to the clouds of food heaven. The horchata was really good considering it came from a fountain drink machine. 

We were checked on at least three or four times during our meal and asked how everything was and if we needed anything else. After we finished eating we started to gather our plates and trash not knowing if we were supposed to take it inside or what, not a second later the manager (at least he seemed like one) came to our table to take it all away. He was very friendly and easy going. 

Next time we want to go out for breakfast it will be Habanero's. I can definitely see why this place is so popular.
