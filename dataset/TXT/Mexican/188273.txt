o6Yor6ofIw2TqM3mN28Kzg El Asador is situated in the middle of Koreatown. I mean, completely surrounded by Korean restaurants on every side, as far as the eye can see. Strange? Who cares, as long as they have good mexican food!

Wow is this place busy. Wednesday night, and there's a constant flow or traffic and the 8 or so picnic tables they have are constantly full! 

When you walk into this tiny corner restaurant, it transports you to the mexican dives commonly found in the states. It's the type of place you'd expect to find authentic Mexican fare, and the type of place I typically love. I really don't understand why people go to "upscale" mexican places with fancy decor to get poor quality food. Anyways... 

The crispy tacos ($3.25) are good, and the beef was definitely better than the chicken. Double layer, homemade taco shells made this a crunchy delight.  But the soft taco ($2.75) was mediocre, and the chicken was very bland. 

The pork pupusa ($2.50) wasn't very good, floury and bland, it was basically eating bread.   I'd pass on this next time. 

The nachos and guacamole were great, though the pricing is strange. $6 for nachos, when a burrito is only $4.50?

the toppings and salsa they give you in bowls were great, good amount of heat (too much for some of my friends).

the prices at this place are pretty good, you can get 3 quality tacos for under $10.  

Friendly service as well.
