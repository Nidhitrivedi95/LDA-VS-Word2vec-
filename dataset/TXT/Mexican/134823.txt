iK9F_Xeg8ut9u2Ee1nVxlg My friend showed me this place for its tacos and it was really good, if you pick the right stuff. I like their sauces and chips that they leave to munch on while we wait. The sanitation and its rating is something I would watch out for though. The service is on and off. One time, we had someone who didn't pay attention to us much and another time where someone was very sweet. All in all, try it and maybe you'll like it.
