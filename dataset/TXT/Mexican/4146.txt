-QC71Wuh0TyJI0RAZ3d0Iw I really like this location. The people who work here are fantastic. 
But. Big but. Today was the day I decide to write my review. 
The guac was black and definitely rotten. Not "ripe" as the tall skinny white girl try to say. But rotten. I have not seen that girl there before so that makes me think that she's probably a manager of some sort. 
A rotten avo tastes like rotten medicine and is black. This guac was black and tasted like rotten medicine. "Ripe" tastes different from rotten. 
There is nothing worse than a rotten avo. Except when that rotten avo ruins your entire meal. 
Anyways. That is all I have to say about this location. 
To recap. The day time people during the week are fantastic. And the food is usually great. But the person trying to convince me that the rotten avo is not rotten is not so cool. 
The end.
