DMmeFKsUuMl0kDy7Zd7W3A For the second time in a row at sandbar, we were going to order more tacos and they told us the kitchen was closed. No warning or anything. Tacos are good but service was awful. Seemed like waitress didn't care and didn't want to be here. Asked about drink menu490 E Appaloosa rd. Gilbert and our waitress says "Jesus Christ" in disgust. Waitress by the name of Krissy. Highly NOT RECOMMENDED!!
