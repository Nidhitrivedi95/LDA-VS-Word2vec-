gldPX9ANF5Nic0N7igu2og I have been here three times and will keep going back.  Lunch the first week that they opened was crowded and the service was spotty.  We had a party of 5 and 4 of us got exactly what we ordered.  The one who didn't had his lunch comped by the manager so he didn't mind.  Returned for Happy Hour on Cinco de Mayo.  Tough to beat 1/2 price margaritas so it was no surprise that they were packed, especially that day.

They claim to have over 30,000 combinations.  It will take me a while to try them all but I will make an effort.  The queso was very good and so were the chips, but they tend to flake easily so you are left with a basket of crumbles.  Tried the chorizo and the brisket tacos.  Both were good, not great.  If you try something and don't like it, then you have plenty of choices for the next visit.  The menu gives you an idea on the heat of the salsa so you can dial it up as hot as you want it.  Maybe next time I will try the ghost pepper sauce.

Hopefully they will get their service issues worked out shortly.
