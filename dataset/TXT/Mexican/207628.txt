QayOwK3LVRVniGnT6Gzveg I have to say that I have yet to visit a chipotle that is as slow and disorganized as this one at night.  This is my second day to visit this location and I'm disappointed.  It's run by a bunch of kids. After watching the bearded man stir the rice under his beard and then pour the rice in the container towards his belly, and then rub the rice off his apron into the bowl, made me think twice about why I was here.
