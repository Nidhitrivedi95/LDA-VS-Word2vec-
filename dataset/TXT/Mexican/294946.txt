ZAqgv1gply0m_4fHAIffWA My friends were kind enough to walk down to grab some dinner for us while they got their gambling on. I had requested the kids rolled tacos chicken meal that came with chips, salsa and a drink. It was really all that I needed to get me through the night. The salas, light drizzle of sour cream and cilantro was perfect. I'd recommend the kids meals to those who want something small but not too small of a meal. 
Thanks Chronic Tacos for helping me not faint from hunger!
