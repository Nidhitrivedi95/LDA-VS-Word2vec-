Ny9cKPLAHjwUEoGjSCWzEw Food always tastes great! No complaints there. However, I do have some complaints about the staff, which is why I gave three stars. 

First of all, there have been times I've had my burrito wrapped half-assed. One time it was completely open. Now, I don't know if their heavy turnover is because they hire complete dumb-asses who cant even manage to wrap a friggin burrito, or because they have bad management. 

Either way, two things come to mind that have pissed me off in the past. 

One; PORTIONS!! I mean seriously, don't be stingy! Give me a decent amount of chips and portions on my food! Especially with rice on the food and chips on the side. Don't give me half a scoop of chips and assume it's enough because that is like 5 chips! I can't stand people who are stingy at these takeout places! I'm paying good money, give me some real portions! 

Two; TRAIN YOUR PEOPLE TO DO THE JOB CORRECTLY! There was nothing that pissed me off more than coming home to an open burrito that spilled all over the bag and my seat! My grandmother can make a burrito better than that and she's 87! Take some pride in your job and do it right! 

Other than that, no complaints. Good food and well priced.
