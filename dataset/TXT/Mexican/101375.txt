EUxbuNT8BYPs_h0vVMy2pg MY FAVORITE MEXICAN PLACE EVER!!! As someone who is Mexican lol I don't like to go out to eat food that I can make at home but this place is amazing! It is a family owned restaurant and the staff is so sweet! My fav is the caldo de Rez and chilaquiles. It is a small place so if it is busy expect to wait a while since there is not tons of seating but definitely worth the wait
