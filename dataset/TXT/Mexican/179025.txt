mz1zD5_eqyCQNuzAqB_iKg This place was amazing! I came here with a few buddies of mine two weeks ago. One buddy was vegan, like myself, the other wasn't. 

Yet, they had something for all of us to enjoy. 

It was really a breath of fresh air that they had a complete, real, multiple choice (very dramatic I know) menu to choose from that was completely vegan. 

Since my vegan introduction I have come to appreciate how many Mexican dishes you can make vegan. This place took my appreciation to a new level. 

I ordered two potato enchiladas and one fried avocado enchilada. They were toppled with vegan cheese and sour cream. Everything tasted fresh and really complemented one another. The rice and beans were good as well, oh and before I forget, make sure you get their fresh guacamole as well!

For dessert I had some wonderful concoction of ice cream and fried chips, I forgot what it was called, but its a must try. And yes, that was vegan too. 

Their customer service didn't lack either. 

If you want some vegan mexican food while in vegas, this is the place to go!
