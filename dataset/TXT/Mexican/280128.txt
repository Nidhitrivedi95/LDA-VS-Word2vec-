xWpy6al-9u02BZz00Kbbyg Great Mexican food in a nice setting. The Chile Colorado is distinctive & doesn't shy away from the heat like some Vegas Mexican joints do, & the guacamole is perfection. Good frijoles, choice of traditional or other varieties (I crave the traditional), & the rice is excellent, a point of pride for Mexican cooks I've known. Attentive service, & in cool little Boulder City - make a day of it & eat well here.
