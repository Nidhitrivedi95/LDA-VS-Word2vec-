MmU8ak-uG-s1RbqXu13m0Q I agree with Katya P. I don't know why everyone is hating. I wouldn't expect the worlds best Mexican food in French Canada so drop that idea. They have good specials and the normal prices aren't bad. Lots of vegetarian options or as with any Mexican place you can usually just replace meat with beans. Try it for yourself.
