apATPHcdiWr-Tgywu6mvHg Very rude customer service left me waiting at the drive-through line 10 minutes I was the only one in line so I was thinking this is going to be quick but no since it took her forever in drive-through I left the drive-through line and i walk In. she's talking with another employee I politely tell her oh you left me waiting for a long time in drive through and she says  can't you see were very busy, I was shocked that she even talked like that to a customer but besides me there was only two people in the whole place. I order my food and I go to get sauce and cucumbers and area was filthy it was so disgusting sauce and food everywhere. I don't know if it's because it was late at night around 1130 that they were tired but they are 24 Business! I probably won't go to that Roberto again
