6ksBg7LoD06ctMU3OfNFUQ I tried this place for the first time and it will be my last visit. I ordered carne asada tacos which were salty beyond belief. My shell was soggy and it only mde my experience worse. I also ordered the Chile colorado taco was moist but didnt have much flavor.  I had high expectations based on the reviews but I ended up disappointed. I wish them the best but again I wont return.
