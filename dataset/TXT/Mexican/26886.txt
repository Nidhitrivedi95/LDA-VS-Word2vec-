Brought some friends from out of town and was stuck in the back room by ourselves when there were plenty of seats out in the main sitting area. Closed in to look at keys. Obviously our waitress had tables in the main sitting area because we rarely saw her. Everyone had tacos except For me, I had the grilled romaine salad with chicken. I actually love this salad. Everyone loved the street corn, "best corn I've ever had".
