7F0ccIsqZSaqi1r7SB4nfQ Well... a FIVE if I had had a margarita to go with it (we were there shortly after opening and before they had their liquor license). Delicious tacos and friendly service.  We had the chicken skin appetizer, fried crispy and delicious. Forget about potato skins! And we had the salsa and guac appetizer.  Yummy guacamole and very fresh.  

Family friendly and a fun vibe.
