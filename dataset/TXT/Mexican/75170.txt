cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A The theme definitely looks and sounds weird but it's a great tasting combo! Must get the carnitas! Super moist and flavorful! Jerk friend chicken was off the chain too! Beans have so much flavor as well! The only thing I didn't care for was the emerald chicken I ordered. Lacked flavor for sure. 

BUT I told the manager My taste buds didn't like it and he graciously changed it to jade chicken for me!! Awesome customer service here!! Peach green tea is super tasty. Man, guy hit this nail on the head!

Located in a run down looking old shopping center. Maybe the "hood" area in Glendale? But so good! Felt safe enough since 6 cops were eating inside too! Drinks have free refills as well. Seriously, try it!
