moZpwq1hNxC-uJRpfupOTA Sunday night my sister flew in from Canada. She wanted some authentic Mexican cuisine so I brought her to Carlsbad. We were served by Jeff who explained that the food is actually New Mexican cuisine, they use peppers in nearly every dish from hatch peppers to habanero and everything in between. Jeff mentioned that he was new to the restaurant and imediately I thought oh no... I thought our service would be slow but he really changed my mind quickly. He was very knowledgable about most everything and he really did an amazing job making is laugh. He suggested the brochettes and potstickers for appetizers which were very good. We also ordered the pasta dish with Chipotle chicken as suggested it was amazingly flavorful. Overall I would give our service and the meal 10 stars if I could.
