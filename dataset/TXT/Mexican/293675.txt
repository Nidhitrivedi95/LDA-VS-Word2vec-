yZ0Ly75hbFx7M-9vDzrS4g Honestly,  I never had a so-called "desire" to try Cafe Rio,  but when this one opened close to my home,  I HAD to try it. Boy was it good!!! Actually,  not good,  but great. I got the enchilada style fire-grilled chicken burrito with rice and beans.  Best damn burrito I've had in a while (sorry Las Santisima, I still love you though). The queso dip,  I mean THE QUESO DIP! Heaven in a cup with tortilla chips.  I would recommend anyone to try Cafe Rio out,  it won't disappoint. 

The only down side I would take from this wonderful building of great food,  is that the inside seating is cramped and there's not many  tables to seat more than 40ish people. But they do have an outdoor seating area which isn't all bad. But regardless,  I would eat on the floor if I had to this place is that great.
