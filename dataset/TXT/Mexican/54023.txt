9Q1ZtzTPFWG4fJiFSko5Xg This place was weird, but some aspects were good. I liked the decor inside the restaurant and I was greeted and seated very quickly. Our server was very friendly, upbeat, and had a nice personality. My issue with the experience we had was As follows:

1) There was no music on, so you could hear plates clanking and everyone else's conversations.

2) One of the salsas that was brought out was piping hot and I wasn't informed. I almost burned my tongue. 

3) The food is described as "Gourmet", but in my opinion was just okay. We got a steak burrito, which was a ground meat with something similar in taste to Kraft cheese on top. The beans and rice were good, though. 

This place has potential, but needs a little work.
