ZSq2GjiFYxdlH3bv_ncxog I have been in the restaurant buisness for 40 years. I started washing dishes and learning customer service at the young age of 12. I have worked all over the world as a Chef. I am know the Executive Chef of a private club in the area. I have never been treated with such disrespect and nastiness as I was today, at your Anthem store. The young girl with a very rude bad attitude needs a huge attitude adjustment. The manager offered a coupon I said no. She offered my money back I said no. What I would like you to do is spend the money on traing these young people properly and if the are going to be nasty show them the door. Its a privilege to work. In and Out Burger has a wonderful happy staff of young people. I think you need to investigate and copy what there doing. Being courteous is a requirement in my kitchens.
