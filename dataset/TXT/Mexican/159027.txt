Ktia9NJfvxVxTLVcEnw9zQ I love the potato bean and cheese burrito. Their enchilada sauce is pretty good and I love their salsa. This is definitely a HOLE IN THE WALL so keep that in mind if you're looking to dine in. You never know how long the line is to order or pick up so come prepared to wait either way. Nothing fancy, just good mexican food. I give it one less star because of the long lines and sometimes even ordering thru the phone you have to wait a long time to have somebody pick up and take your order. But hey, if you have cops and people in business suits eating here even though it's in the sketchiest part of town, you might as well give it a shot!
