frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A The Gandhi burrito was amazing!!! I substituted the rice for cheese and it tasted delicious!!! Everyone raved about the salsa bar, but the salsas seemed old and noone was refilling them, it was a great concept but wish it was more fresh! The horschatta was also good, a but pricy but it has fruits and pecans which we never had before! My husband got the tacos which were good but not the best hes ever had. I would def go to get the burrito
