iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg Look. Let me get straight to the point. This was the best taco that I've ever had in my life. Normally when I get busy with a new meal, I like to savour the flavours bite by bite, taking my time to appreciate nuance. When I took a bite of this gift to humanity I went through the following: giggling to no one in particular, doing a little jig to the music playing across the street, saying the lord's name in vane, etc, etc.
I ordered the Gobernador. When you undoubtedly order the same, you'll be handed a flour tortilla taco starring: smoked tuna, shrimp, red onion, and cheese. You'll start questioning if this little thing is going to do anything for your hunger. I'll be honest, this will not replace a meal, but the experience will be more than sufficient. If you can handle the heat, take my advice and add some of their house made hot sauce. Don't go mild. Go hot and EARN the bold pairing of spices with the succulent smoked tuna and juicy shrimp! Killer meat combo.
In summary, if you happened to be walking by Seven Lives Tacos Y Mariscos while on the brink of death from dehydration, and then were served one of these masterpieces, you wouldn't drink water and risk washing these top shelf flavours off your tongue. Respect it. Go.
