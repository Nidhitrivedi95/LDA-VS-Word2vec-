Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ Javier's never disappoints. I had a reservations for 8 and we had to wait a while but not to bad. Our server was amazing we came here for my boyfriends birthday but I forgot to tell the server he over heard us talk about a birthday so he ask one of our friends. He brought us the most delicious flan. One thing the margaritas are so amazing.
