3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ Two words. Pork avodado. The most amazing thing I've eaten in a long time. The side of rice was only ok. The chicken guild and lamb tacos were nothing special,  but that pork!!! Amazing! !! A bit loud on a Friday night with the live dj in a small space. . . But that pork is enough to pull a 4 star and I'll be back! !
