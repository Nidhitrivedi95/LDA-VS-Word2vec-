2JUDgnmoLDxD97gqmand9Q Myself and 3 others in front of me had placed our orders which had already been completed and we're waiting to checkout. For over 5 min to go orders continued to walk up. Not once did the cashier stop to check us out. She would continue to take the to go orders that had just walked up and cash them out in front of us. After 5 min of this happening I just left without my food. If you are going to eat here make sure you place a pick up order because they clearly don't care about clients who plan on eating inside.
