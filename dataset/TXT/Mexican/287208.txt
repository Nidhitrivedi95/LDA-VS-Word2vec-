YbsnQgu_3OmNYsCMXegeHw I eat here all the time. The food is always good with good portion sizes.  Prices are reasonable. A lot of people say the staff isn't friendly enough. To me they do what they are supposed to do. They get your order right and are attentive to your table. The perception that they aren't friendly is probably because English isn't their first language. I'm not a fan of the fajitas, they are just ok to me. All of the burritos are really good. The cheesecake chimichanga is out of this world. Like I said I go here all the time because its good.
