ZBFfY_WLbp19sADTZ_LRMg I just didn't like this place. It was poor value (cost vs. quality and portions) and nothing impressed me. The pickled jalapeños were bland, and I expect more (3 halves) for 6 dollars. I had the La revolucion for the main. It was OK but again it was bland. It needed some crunch. Some lettuce or tomatoes. Something.  Desert. Tres leches. Boring. Service was OK. Had a friend ask for a michelada but they didn't have them. They tried to make one but it tasted like nasty. Also cost extra. Also had someone with an onion allergy.  Asked for onion on the side. They forgot. Overpriced and underwhelming.
