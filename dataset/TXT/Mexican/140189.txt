J7B-hSSYDYSIQx5xiqOJTw After reading what people said I had to write my first review.   

This place is my current obsession!!   And  I'm no newbie to Mexican food- most especially margaritas.   In fact I am on the quest for the perfect margarita in the world.   Yes I ask for a margarita ( and discuss the same with the server and/ or bartender - fair warning) everywhere I travel.    I have had margaritas in Mexico, South America, across the U.S.in Europe and the Mediterranean .   I could eat ( and drink) Mexican everyday (yes I like pizza Chinese and sushi too)  but this is my place.    It takes more than one visit to perfect what u like (chipotle took a few visits for me to figure it out-now yum).   

This place rocks!   The bartenders and kitchen will modify anything you want.   The happy hour (3 to 6 EVERY day!!!) is amazing and unparalleled.  There is a little bit of fun (free face painting on day of the dead).    I gotta say I have nothing critical to say (don't forget we live in the real world where people take time to complain more than take the time to say anything nice).   Live.  Eat.  Have fun. Life is short .

I hope they are around for a long long time


Ps I just checked yelp and I have been to 17 of the top 18 local Mexican places...
