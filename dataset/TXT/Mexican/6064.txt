_Fo8uNT17BEBUkKvUXCZkQ closest thing to socal's taco trucks!

small hole in the wall joint with a few tables...but honestly, it's these places that are usually my fav! Authentic flavors and well priced at a buck fifty per taco!

Definitely check this place out for the best street tacos in Vegas! (other than el gordo)
