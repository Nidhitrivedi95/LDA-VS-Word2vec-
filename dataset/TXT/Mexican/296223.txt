zCmwErM82hdKl4L2UixDJw How this place is always packed, let alone gets returning customers is a mystery. Worst tacos ever. The braised beef tasted like dry roadkill. The service was worse than the BMV. Our server was extremely annoyed every time we needed something, didn't come to our table for 45 mins. We had to eat our dry roadkill without drinks because getting a refill was apparently just impossible. All-around horrible experience. The hostess was really nice though.
