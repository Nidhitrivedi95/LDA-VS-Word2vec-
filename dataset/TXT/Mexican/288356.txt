Yevhl8bTwdJuu_LWKv-4Fw This place is FANTASTIC! Definitely 5 stars- the ambiance is great! Real packed which is proof that it is a great place.  I had the plantain crusted tilapia with mushroom grits and garlic roasted spinach on the side.  My date had the chicken breast with salsa (amazing) on the side.  Desert was the BEST part- do not miss out on the tres chocolate layered cake!  Great Great place-service was great!
