We were sat quickly, chips & salsa are pretty good. Ordered our food less than 10 mins later our food was served to us! (Not sure about you, but I'm highly impressed)! 
Halfway through our meal, I ordered a small strawberry margarita, no joke by the time we walked out of there I told my husband I was light way buzzed. 

Now fast forward a handful of visits...the last time we were there(our Anniv. July 2014) it was dinner, pretty busy, got seated in the back, NO AC, and the place smelled like sweaty gym socks!
