iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg After hearing so many pleasant reviews from my friends, particularly this one friend who vowed his life on it, my boyfriend and I decided to go by Seven Lives when we were walking through Kensington Market.

Let me say that this place holds up to all the amazing reviews! The staff were pretty nice and the little joint was cute and small.

If you're coming with a lot of people then this might be bad news because there isn't a lot of seating. There's tables you can stand by and a small sofa and table by the window. It's small but that's probably where some of this place's charm comes from.

My boyfriend had the gobernador and I had the baja fish~ the tacos were $6 for one which seemed a bit pricy but when you look at the taco you'll be surprised! They put a lot of filling and the taco is stuffed! I wondered why they offered forks on the counter and I know why now! It's to pick up the pieces that fall out of the taco!

When I bit into the taco my tastebuds were taken to some utopia. It was so fresh, flavourful, and amazing. Each bite made me want more and more and I will be coming back to try the other kinds of tacos they have!

They also have three homemade salsa (hot, medium, and mild) and I really love spicy things but I decided to mix the medium and mild together and it was amazing!

I highly recommend this place if you want fresh, flavourful tacos in every bite :)
