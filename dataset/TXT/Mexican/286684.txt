yAXWKWRTs4wNy-zrJgoeXQ Café Tranquilo is a nice place to enjoy a meal. We went to Sunday brunch, very relaxed atmosphere. Bloody Mary was awesome, 4 dollars. Food was great. La Tripleta is what I ordered, could only eat half and was stuffed. Jacob was our server, he was amazing. The place is sort of hipster which threw me off, but it did not detract from the overall experience, or annoy me. I will definitely be back. Oh, and this place makes everything in house. Very fresh, savory, and filling. Decent tap beer selection too. Overall, I normally hate eating at hotel cafés, but this place was pretty amazing!!!
