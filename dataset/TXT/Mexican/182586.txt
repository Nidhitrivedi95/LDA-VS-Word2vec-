nIwtGMkMyx0elLxVFs1D6A I ate all my  Barbacoa Tacos (lamb) and that's 4 pieces of yumminess in my plate!!! I usually don't finish my dish, surprisingly did! Even my Dad and Bf. My bf inhaled the Flan, which was freshly made in the restaurant by the owner's wife. I just LOLed!!! Highly recommended! Nothing but love for this Gem! See you guys soon!!!
