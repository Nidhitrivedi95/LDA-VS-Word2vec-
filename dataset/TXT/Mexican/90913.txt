DYGCzsHi7pT4AAe8kh5Dug Nope. Did not enjoy what-so-ever. First off, don't scream at your customers. Secondly, cook your f***ing rice (crunchy uncooked rice in a burrito? give me a break!), and third, I guess if you've never had a proper burrito than this place passes in your books. There are much better burrito places out there with more variety on the menu (and let's be honest, it's just the same ingredients arranged in different ways so is it really that hard to offer more than burritos and sludge bowls??) and, servers who don't scream at you when you're paying.... oh, and let me just warn you they only take cash or credit card... are you really going to charge a $10 burrito? If so, you have money management issues. Pus no one carries cash on their person these days. FAIL!!!!
