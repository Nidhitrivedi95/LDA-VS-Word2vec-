Ouh38adC9WbCRSSyYGtL3Q We had our first dinner at the Margaritas Grill, and I have to say I was impressed.

A group of five showed up around 7pm on a Thursday. Not surprisingly, it wasn't very busy. Our waitress was very nice, friendly, and helpful.

You'd expect that a place named Margaritas Grill would have good margaritas, and they did not disappoint. The stands out favorites were the Cadillac, the Pancho Villa, and the Blue Agave.

One of my personal litmus tests for a decent Mexican food restaurant is good chips and salsa--I mean, if they can't get that right, what hope do they have for anything else? Both were spot on and plentiful.

Everything we ordered was good. My shrimp burrito was lively spiced and combined with avocados. It was a sublime combination that did't rely on the typical sour-cream-and-cheese to give it flavor.

But nothing we ordered carried a candle to the intoxicating Mole de Pollo and Killer Chimichanga with Chili Verde. The mole was sinfully rich--my friend could barely eat more than half of her's, which was fine by me because I got to have some her left overs the next day. And the chili verde was possible the best I've ever tasted. Our waitress told use the chili verde was very popular, and they often end up making three or four batches on busy nights.

Overall, an excellent experience and my new favorite place to eat in downtown mesa.
