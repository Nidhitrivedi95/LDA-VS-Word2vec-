-PKUAor_Nz_IaNjP_jIwyA Went for drinks and snacks at 9 Saturday. It was very busy. We did have reso's but the place was a lot smaller than we thought and very crowded. If your not claustrophobic. You'll be fine. But it's cramped and lively. No doubt. Service was decent and prices moderate for the area. The guacamole is great - they will refill ur chips but they're super deep fried. Pass. Tried the tacos ( delicious) and shrimp app. Very good food. Tapas style. Loved the decor. Great for a night out but don't know if I'll become a regular.
