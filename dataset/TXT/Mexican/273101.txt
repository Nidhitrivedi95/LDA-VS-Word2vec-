WwvSDgFkx3f0piozrdMxtQ The actual food was decent, although portion sizes are very small considering the price. Server took his time getting to us. He then took our order and disappeared. About 30 minutes went by and we still did not get drinks. Finally got food and order was wrong. While he apologized, no manager came by and they did nothing for us. It took 15 more minutes to get the right order and then server disappeared again. My food was spicy and I never got a refill on my drink. Again, no manager and they didn't even do anything for us. Will never be back. They obviously don't care.
