wTNWq7jrCZD1q2hSjUtTXg It was an ok experience. Busy night...our waiter was very busy and we understood very nice gentleman though! I just wish the used more authentic ingredients in their food. I got enchiladas supremas. One cheese,bean,chicken,and beef. The cheese i feel should be ACTUAL CHEESE not queso. The "beef" was not shredded beef it was the exact same consistency as taco bell meat. Processed, ground beef. We got a pitcher of margarita. I weigh 120 lbs and had three my bf had 3 neither one of us was buzzed....weak marg. Service was good when it actually came around but it really just came down to the food and drink not being up to par.
