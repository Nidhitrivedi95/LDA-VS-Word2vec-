FMo1PJTUV5OpyiZlnTM1Rg The entire staff was extremely friendly and made us feel welcomed. The food was very very tasty and fresh. All their food is organic and non-gmo and the prices are very reasonable reflecting that. I was sad to see mac shack go but I think this will be my favorite place now. We are already planning a trip back there because the food was just that good and the menu is diverse so you can't get bored of it. See y'all soon
