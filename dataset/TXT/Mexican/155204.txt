K4rLi2Mqz931v07nMSih5w I have had enough of half filled bowls!! I'm paying $8 for half of a salad?!? The customer service is terrible and I have to ask for more lettuce? No! The manager is so rude and treats the customer and staff like idiots. They had 3 workers in the kitchen talking and do absolutely nothing, and 16 people in line... after the long line I waited 10 min to actually get your food and the chips and salsa is so over priced. I didn't even get nearly enough salsa for the handful of chips in my bag! Rip off at this location!!! Go somewhere else!
