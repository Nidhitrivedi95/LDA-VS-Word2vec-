giCq1MmW-_S2tvNOAHvJcQ Pretty quaint spot tucked away between Biltmore and Arcadia neighborhoods.

I love that you can walk right on over to their Wine Store, select a bottle, and take over to your table for no corking fee. 

This place has a lovely, quaint atmosphere, not a ton too much seating and tons of low lighting that creates a glow on the wooden walls.

I went with the ricotta gnudi pasta for dinner - by the sounds of it, you'd think italian-style pasta full of marinara sauce right? Nope! This pasta is more of a hearty pot roast packed with slow-cooked au jus, vegetables, succulent pulled pork, and last but not least... ricotta stuffed gnudi pasta pieces! It wasn't quite what I was thinking when I ordered the dish, but it sure was tasty. 

My one drawback was that the portion was a tad on the smaller size. It didn't help that it was served on a plate the size of a satellite either..it REALLY didn't look like I got much food then.

Solid little spot - give 'er a try!
