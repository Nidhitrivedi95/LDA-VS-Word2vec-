ViJGzET7fBMShhIgKew2Bg We ordered the Chicken/Steak/chorizo fajitas, Enchiladas with green sauce and Taquitos. The food is ok. We were disappointed that the tortilla shells and guacamole are store bought vs homemade. The place needs a good cleaning and we were sat at a table that needed wiping before we sat down. Service is friendly and the value was good. I appreciate supporting the small businesses but I won't return. I'm not sure it deserves a "Best in Mississauga" reputation.
