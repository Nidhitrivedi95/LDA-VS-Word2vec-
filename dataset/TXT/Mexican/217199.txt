R7LyTeiOHLyTNkA8HssBRQ We stumbled across this place one sunny afternoon on our way to run errands. Since I'm still fairly new to this city I like trying different places, finding suitable replacements for my old stomping grounds in LA.  Anyhow this place looked like it was fairly new the bunch of men behind the counter looked like they were still working on fine tuning the registers. The cashier seemed nervous and distracted.  Needless to say she got my order wrong, when confronted didn't apologize or offer to correct it. The gentle man behind the counter stepped in and quickly apologized and offered to let me have the incorrect item as a comp. Okay problem fixed no worries right? Wrong...  the cook threw it away but no worries I didn't care the gesture was all that matters. And that wasn't the only problem upon a close look at the receipt we discovered we were charged for every additional topping so our three dollar taco was more like five dollars and our five dollar burrito was closer to eight dollars and there was the wait.... over 20 minutes with only one person ahead of us. But I do have to say the food was good so flavorful and authentic .The food deserves five stars but unfortunately service matters to me when I rate a restaurant. I will be back for the food but I really hope they work on thier customer service, clear up the pricing and ticket times...this is a FAST food restaurant after all.
