br2M2b-CsXI0HY0RXvHl0w I LOVE this place!
Found it by accident, it's kind of hidden.  
The food is authentic and fresh.  Fair prices and cute interior.  There's also a patio which is a bonus.
They use real corn tortillas for the soft tacos instead of flour which I love, really Mexican.
The staff/owners are the real deal and very friendly.
Wish this place was close by, I'd be there every day!
