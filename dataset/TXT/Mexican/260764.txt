VRwT0pscR5vESCrAnUpNwQ A hot sauce lover like myself definitely appreciated the fresh hot sauce/salsa bar!

I tried both the mushroom and grilled avacado tacos and they were nothing to write home about, unfortunately. The grilled avacado taco may have had a delicious pineapple salsa but I felt that this could not be thoroughly enjoyed with the overwhelming amount of avacado in every bite. 

Giving Wilbur 3 stars anyway because of the quick service despite the bustling location, affordable prices  and the aforementioned salsa bar.
