szlIcLQE7K-1JuKeJIRKsQ The food is good, especially for Pittsburgh. It is located conveniently on Murray. The owners are nice people.

I was frequenting their restaurant a lot after getting conned once stopped going there. It is usually the owner's wife serving herself but the last time I went there they had a new waitress. We were two people ordered 13 dollarish dishes each and two non-alcoholic beverages like Coke. We had a 40 dollar bill that came to us, but I could not remember what the exact prices were. We were like maybe it is with the tax and stuff. I asked her to double-check the charges she just smiled and brought it back. So, we payed it plus the tip. But I felt like this should not be what it costs and checked their menu online and I was right. Who enjoys being conned like that? Although I like their food, it happened to be last time I went there...
