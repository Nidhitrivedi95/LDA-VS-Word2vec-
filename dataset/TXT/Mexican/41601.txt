7-Ba9uSmYYpXgnQRoIPxMQ I came in for lunch and sat for ten minutes without getting my water or having my order taken.  As there were only six tables occupied, I thought that was to long.  I don't like to rate a place strictly on service, but that was unacceptable.  I may return and give them another chance some day.
