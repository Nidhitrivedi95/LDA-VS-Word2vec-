YkOCo5ipV2he2WXIAlZb-A Came here for the first time personally after work to grab some dinner. Not bad of a line slightly before dinner time, around 5-6 o clock on a Sunday afternoon. Friendly staff. 

Previously i had ordered a burrito that my friend picked up for me which was a decent size. This time, by recommendation for "more filling meal", i had ordered a bowl instead. 

I had realized the only one i've been ordering all this time is Redondo. The Redondo consists of ahi tuna, salmon, yellowtail, red onion, jalapeno, topped with masago, tortilla strips, cilantro, and wasabi mayo. 

They take each order separately and will ask you how many orders you are doing. When i saw how much rice they put into the bowl, i was happy. XD I thought i'd have to ask for more (like i usually do for Chipotle) but it is quite the amount. They use a really small scoop, like a melon baller scoop for the fish but its still a decent amount to saturate the bowl pretty decently while eating. Red onions give a nice sweet and crispness while jalapeno and wasabi mayo gives it a nice punch ! According to some friends, there seem to be more tortilla strips than normal but i didnt mind. Was a nice snack while eating the bowl. Lol 

Speed in ordering wasn't too bad. Fairly decent for what it is. Could be a faster but can't complain. I've been to the other location Soho Sushiburrito on Sahara and it was much smaller than this location and much slower service. Different names on menu but identical ingredients. This is a much more spacious and easier to access location. 

They have a side bar of various salsas, wasabi, and a place for you to get soy sauce as well.

Decent location right off Rainbow and 215, northbound on rainbow, next to Rosallie's. 

Bowl is an amazing deal and will definitely fill you up pretty well. Burrito for the not so big eaters as its still a decent size. Highly recommended place for a quick bite of some fresh seafood.
