pugciBzSCFqa_vn-X5pcEQ I went with four stars for only one flaw, the menu is confusing and not accommodating for their "premium or special" taco meats like the fried fish or shrimp tacos. I wanted to try one fish taco and one of another kind but if you get a premium meat you can't mix and match you have to get 2 or 3 of the same. So, I chose some meats off the standard menu and was very happy with them. Delicious green chile shredded beef and a carne asada steak taco. We also had the street tacos, red chicken and steak, super good. We will definitely be back! Also has a steak quesadilla and it was very good.
