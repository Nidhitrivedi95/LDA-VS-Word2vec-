JEQaPs7jNT1M2os9lJDlUA This is my neighborhood joint for sure!!

Tried this cozy little spot when I first moved to Phoenix and have been a fan ever since. the ambiance is great. Just like dining in a little old house. Very intimate, clean and romantic. The service is super friendly. The food is phenomenal for the price. Extremely affordable, not pretentious, and just plain tasty. I'm a huge fan of the open faced crab cake sandwich and the BLT wrap (?) I can't remember the menu item names. Pomegranate hummus was delish! Everything is fresh and tasty.

This is just a well rounded, casual neighborhood spot. I haven't been disappointed since.

The only reason I give this spot four stars instead of five is because it's not quite fine dining and it's not mind blowing. It's just plain good with a nice atmosphere and at a good value.
