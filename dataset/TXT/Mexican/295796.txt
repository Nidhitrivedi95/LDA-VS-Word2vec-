ZCe93zAkxr2KOBU1NT0lmg I almost choked to death on a bone in my shredded beef at lunch. After eating here maybe a half dozen times before, I ordered the lunch special with shredded beef taco and shredded beef enchilada, plus rice and beans. When I went to swallow the second bite of my enchilada, I couldn't breathe. I also couldn't swallow. Something hard was stuck in my throat. I quickly ran to the bathroom, gagged myself, and out came a bone in the shape of a hook about the size of a quarter. Why was a bone in my shredded beef? They remade my food, this time with ground beef since I couldn't stomach shredded beef after that. They comp'd my meal but not my drink or my friend's meal. He was finished eating by the time my remade food came. My throat has been scratched all day since the meal. Disappointed in the food and the service. I'm not sure I can handle eating here again.
