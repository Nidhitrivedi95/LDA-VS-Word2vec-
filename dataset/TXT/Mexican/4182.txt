-Qkx7W0itbAApcG5lJuMFQ I got the veggie sushi burritos.  It was amazing.  The "beef" is made from soy and beans and it's really crazy tasty!

I thought this was a chain to I googled and figured out that it is not...darn.  I'm back in California now and was looking to see how close I could fine one to where I live.  Guess I will have to go back to Vegas to get this MORE THAN AMAZING meal!  DARN!
