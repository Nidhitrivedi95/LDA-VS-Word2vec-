oi_jhCtPLj6NULrCe_JllA After years of living in Chandler, I decided to finally check out this place. Elmer moved to the USA from Mexico and started this place in the early 70's. He took inspiration from his mother's recipes and has been serving his awesome tacos to the downtown Chandler area for decades. I love good authentic Mexican food and this place sells it at a good price. Definitely come on Taco Tuesdays for some great specials.
