Kcg5iMwYq5ibBuEhDXKx3Q El Centro serves quintessentially delicious Mexican fare. The restaurant is fairly small with about 10 tables and no waiting room. But the food is definitely worth the outdoor wait. The guacamole topped with pomegranate is served with plantain chips and hits the sweet spot. The tacos are par excellence. We had the fish and pastor tacos and would love to get them again. Although we didn't try it, the pork ribs looked divine. The chocolate chili ice cream is the perfect end to the meal. Reminded me of the great Mexican cuisine I've grown to love in Texas.
