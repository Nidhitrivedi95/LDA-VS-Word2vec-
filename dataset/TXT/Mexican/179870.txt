N-tpz2XtAPreL5wnFjKGwA Great place for authentic cheap tacos. Had 1 chicken, 1 beef head, and one steak taco. All only $1.50 (all tasted great but I wouldn't get the chicken one again cause it was a bit bland and mushy) the real treat ended up being the horchata. (Best horchata I've had in a long time) and they only charge $1 for a refill on a large (well worth the extra buck for another delicious horchata) I will definitely eat here again.
