XWafv9_J7TUOO4PbEcIFJA Came to this place after searching on Yelp for good places for quick Mexican food and after reading reviews and looking at the pictures, I decided to try this spot out.

On arriving at location, I was a bit skeptical to try the food out as the place from the outside is old and not inviting at all. I may have mistaken the place as being shut down if I had come during times they were closed down. Also, there were only two other cars parked, so wasn't sure if that was an indication of the quality of service and food offered here.

The inside of the restaurant is also old. Tables look like they haven't been updated or replaced since they first opened. The walls and floors are also dirty and old. Everything about the place is old, dirty and outdated. Smell of the place isn't inviting neither, but despite all that, I decided to try the food out.

I decided to order the Carna Asada burrito and my guest got the bean and cheese burrito along with a cheese quesadilla. I ordered a small drink, but was given a large one. Big negative for this place is the fact that the lady at the register didn't even ask what drink i wanted and just gave me a Pepsi, which I don't like or drink!! 

On the other hand, the Carna Asada Burrito was amazing!! The meat was tender and full of flavor. Just the perfect amount of guacamole and pico de gallo to tie the burrito together. Was a pretty good size as i had to cut it in a half and take home part for another meal. 

Bean and cheese burrito was just okay. Was told that it was pretty much the same that you could get at Taco Bell. Cheese quesadilla was almost too much too eat. Cheese tasted like fake cheese and was too rubbery to even eat!! After tasting it, I almost got sick. Will never have that again, or probably anything with cheese in it from this place.

Will come back again to try something else, but have decided that I'll only use the drive through.
