lv5Bnqlt93NnvNJ2oNcQ8Q Not my favorite Mexican compared to Flaming Fajitas or Viva Mercado who's rice, beans, chips and salsas are addictive. The rice they served is not true Tex Mex rice. The color was too dark and the grains too big, but flavor ok. The service was great and the Manager personally visited twice. I really hope they tweak a few of these staple items and success
