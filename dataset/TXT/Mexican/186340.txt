NYpmDzwzAQyv0gQG5gBKbw This restaurant has a nice vibe for a basement. The bathrooms are dank and smelly like most basement bathrooms tend to be on the Danforth, but at least they tried to make them look pretty. Service was slow, in fact some people that arrived after us were served before us. After ordering I was disappointed that our guacamole arrived before my mojito. Apparently it takes a long time to crush the mint according to our waiter, but I think it had more to do with the bartender''s long personal conversation with another member of the staff. The mojito itself was bitter, which I found odd as I've never had a bitter mojit before, it was almost as if some tonic water had been added to it. The smoked trout guacamole and homemade tortilla chips were good, albeit there was very little smoked trout in the guacamole. I would call it guacamole with essence of smoked trout. The fish tacos were very nice, fresh and light tasting which made us hopeful for our next dish which was the tacos with duck confit. I have my suspicions that the duck was actually turkey leg. I have never had such horrible duck in my life. It was very overcooked. There were some bits that were too tough to even chew. Also there were bits of bone in the meat. The hostess told us this is because they scrape the meat off the bone to shred it (Really, the meat was shredded? I don't think so, it was in big hunks in some sort of sweet red sauce). The portion sizes were not big, but that didn't bother us much since the food really wasn't that good. There are so many better Mexican restaurants in Toronto, don't waste your money here.
