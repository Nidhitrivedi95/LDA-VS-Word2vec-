vFylbmcjMRaVxYeDZhnGyw We were in the area and wanted a bite before going to the movies.  We walked in around 2 on a Friday, so there wasn't a wait.  We chose a booth and was greeted by our waitress.  She took our drink order and left us to decide what we wanted for our meals.
We decided on some tableside guac, which is made to order and fantastic.  You get a serious amount of guac, which I probably ate too much of...if that's such a thing.  Definitely consider this if you're going for some apps.
I wanted to go a little lighter on my meal, so I ordered the chicken fajita salad.  It was good.  The chicken was juicy.  I choose the avocado ranch, which was something different.   You don't find that many places.  According to our waitress, it is made in house.
Our waitress kept coming over to refill our drinks, drop off napkins, and check if we needed anything else.  I have been to other OTBs, but this one had the best service and food.
