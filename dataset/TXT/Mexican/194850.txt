OTcBXjDkViDPds4Lxy8KIQ This was my first time going to this place. Frankly, I was disappointed. They took 30 min to make 2 burritos and pozole. The pozole was also cold. Burrito tasted average. The price was a little bit high compared to other Mexican restaurants and not justifiable compared to other burrito places such as Pepe's tacos and taco y taco.
