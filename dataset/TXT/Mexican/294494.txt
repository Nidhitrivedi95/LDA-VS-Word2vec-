Z6t15TXGlVh3-2ClZunCgg I'm not exaggerating when I say that I have a severe love for tacos... And when I found it this place is only right up the street from my house? I had to try it out. And thank God I did because these are some of the best tacos I've ever had. Everything about the meat to the tortillas have so much flavor!! There flautas are very light and crispy with a lot of meat inside of them. And the co-pays are just to die for. And both of their red and green sauces have a competition with my taste buds every time I tried them. They are both to die for!! I literally eats there probably three times a week I've recommended tons of friends here and they all have said the same exact thing, the best tacos I've ever had!!!!
