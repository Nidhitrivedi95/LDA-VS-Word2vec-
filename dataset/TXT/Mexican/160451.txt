kxzS-zh5nUNvBzYz2Q47pg Love this place. They honored happy hour for my wife and I with our baby in the dining room. Something that Upper Crust on Cave Creek refused to do, that pizza place has horrible service. Spotted Donkey has super nice and pleasant people. The food is outstanding. Happy hour prices are amazing. Margaritas are superb. One of my favorite happy hours and Mexican restaurants. Try the happy hour taquitos.
