cJzv3fbd7jL2ZHyFosFkOw We've ordered from king wongs twice now and we Love this place! The last time we ordered at 920 and they close at 930 and were happy to still deliver. We've had the general tso's, sweet and sour chicken and the pot stickers ( our new favorite)  and they were all great! Sam the delivery guy is so nice and very prompt.  My boyfriend thinks Sam sounds like Casey kasem, which for him is a plus!
