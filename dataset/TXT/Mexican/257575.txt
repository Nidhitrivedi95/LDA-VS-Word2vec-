ViJGzET7fBMShhIgKew2Bg Food was great. Staff were polite. Best mexican food I've had so far. And in terms of burritos and tacos...This is more authentic. Burrito boys, Chipotle, all those other fast food taco places are not comparable. This place actually has good flavor. Side dishes like beans and Mexican rice were pretty good. Tried the chimichangas and baja tacos...I do believe they have the best fish tacos in sauga at a good price. Almost comparable to grand electric...In terms of fish tacos only. Will come back for sure.
