7m1Oa1VYV98UUuo_6i0EZg What a simply amazing, unique experience!  For my first visit, I let the cashier guide me to their signature burger -- the burger Brulée.  Check out the menu for the ingredients, which sound crazy, but the result is just stunning.  You've never had anything like it.  

The house BBQ chips are excellent.  I'm not a fan of commercial BBQ chips as they basically just taste like salt, sugar, and fake smoke.  These are perfectly crisp, with a hint of sweet/salt, and a very light hint of BBQ flavor.  You still taste mostly crispy potato, which is great.

For my second visit I went with a burger of the day that had Korean pork on top, with a few other ingredients, and beer-battered burger patties.  Again, a crazy combo that was simply fantastic.

The wife had their grilled cheese with bacon, also exceptional.
