t2oeG8yZHvogZOHzOE867w I'd give this place 0 stars if possible. I cannot believe that this place is still in business. They can't get your order right to save their lives. I ordered carne asada and got a chicken burrito. WTF. To make matters worse the burrito was disgusting. After one bite I threw it in trash. Save your money and go somewhere else.
