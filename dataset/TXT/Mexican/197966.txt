p1MZyPUMflxMARQ6I8X3Kw the family that owns this little falafel place is really nice! I got the falafel sandwich which comes with fresh made falafel that they press in a grill. I asked for lentil soup also and was given a little sample which was also perfect for a chilly day! 

Everything is homemade and they even have a YouTube channel to teach you how make their signature falafel. Really the best! They have a simple menu with a variety of healthy or hearty options.
