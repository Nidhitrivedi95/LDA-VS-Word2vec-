IMu-TDHot24Y0X7ESLxHyA Good food and cute company :) lets first start off by saying that it took longer than 5 minutes to be sat. It was not packed and we had been noticed twice. While the food was adequate and our two alcoholic beverages were very good there was just one last thing that got me. We ordered a shot of tequila and it tasted watered down or not quite right. If it weren't for the adorable birds outside and my bf, there would be only 1 star.
