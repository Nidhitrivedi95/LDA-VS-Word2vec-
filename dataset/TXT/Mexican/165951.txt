lOQPeguczAueJnLmDUTfGg We're out-of-towners and came here on a recommendation from friends that frequently come here. They also recommended we try the Playa La Llorona (seafood platter). This dish is full of flavor, very tasty. There were various shrimp prepared differently. The crab legs were also tasty. The rice served in the platter was my favorite with a flavorful sauce that included fish and squid -- yummy!! Violeta, our server, was very gracious and friendly. Would definitely recommend this place and come back next time we're in town.
