cfSuc4q7pQLF28mMbx1MRg I've lived in the area for over 10 years and I think I might have come in to Que Mas years ago and it was obviously unmemorable.  Because of all the positive yelp reviews, I decided to come back in for a late lunch.  I'm so glad I did.  First of all, we had two servers who were both very attentive.  There was a younger man who was nice and another gentleman which obviously English was not his first language.  That man was so friendly that he alone was worth the trip. He was so smiley and nice you can't help but smile and get a little happier than when you came in.  The food was good too. I had the beef flautas and my husband had the seafood burrito.  Both were excellent. I didn't find the prices to be high.  I guess maybe if you are comparing to Robertos  - not that I'm knocking Robertos cuz they are great for a quick to go meal but the quality is not the same.  You get what you pay for.
