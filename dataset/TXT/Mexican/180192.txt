N5CL5HLS6lyltw-OjjBrOw Came here because they have a vegan menu and always looking for places to take our vegan child. Service was not good, happened to stop in during happy hour but we did not know it was and our server did not tell us. Overheard another server telling a couple about HH. Seems like good food and drink specials. Ordered lots of food. Most was good. I review each under attached photos. My son and husband both ordered chilaquiles. My husband's red sauce was burnt, he sent it back for another chicken quesadilla. My sons chilaquiles were also burnt. Both the chips and the sauce were burnt. He asked for them to be remade but waitress told him that most likely they would also be burnt so he did not order anything else. The manager did not remove the chilaquiles from our bill even though they were not edible. Also checked in on Yelp and showed the waitress the free corn offer, SHE pressed the 'Redeem Offer's  a button in hubby's phone and she brought the corn and then charged us for it. We did not notice until after we left that we had been charged for the burnt chilaquiles and the corn Yelp offer until after we left so husband Called manager Brian and were told that can not use the help offer with the Groupon and only said sorry about that. Waitress knew we had a Groupon when we walked in but failed to mention that when we showed her the Yelp offer. Overall, the food was good except the chilaquiles, but the service, particularly the service from the manager was not good.
