SW6ZQk22G1_CV81_gfnvNQ I'm glad that I had the chance to try some other taco joints in order to have a comparison.  La Carnita just blew them all out of the water!  I'm still thinking about their deep fried chicken thigh taco!

Their nachos and dip is a large portion and great for sharing with a few people.  Although tasty, it was a bit too much for two.  Their soft tacos were delicious, fresh and loaded with flavour. 

Located in Toronto's Little Italy neighborhood, the restaurant had a laid back yet upscale feel.  The interior is trendy and the atmosphere is similar to a loud pub.  There is a small patio in the front and the seating arrangements are mainly communal tables.     

I'll be sure to come back to try more tacos.
