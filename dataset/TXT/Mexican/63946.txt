B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA Had lunch yesterday with a friend. Food was a 5 service was a 4 only due to the fact that we had never been there and they did not really take any time out to explain anything to us. Granted it's all explained on the menu but there's a long line as it was lunch time and I felt rushed to pick. Beyond that we had nothing to do so we sat for a few hours and caught up on general conversation and were not given any issues about leaving. Overall I was satisfied and will be back.
