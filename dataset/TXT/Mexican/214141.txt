QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA I thought the price for the fish tacos was ridiculous but when they brought it out it was so worth it. They were giant and super yummy. I would order it again 

Tried the crab and lobster nachos and it was just aite. Would not order again


Filet mignon nachos were super yummy. Would order again. 

Plus free margaritas with every entree order when you check in with yelp. CANT BEAT IT
