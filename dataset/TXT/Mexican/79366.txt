cUFBO-5Fgd7pR0JUakWXSw The space is beautiful!! They did an amazing job remodeling the old Bobbys in kieraland. I absolutely love the cucumber jalapeño margarita and lamb tacos which you can share. Most of the food is pretty small but very delicious. Get table side guac and street corn!! FYI make sure the hostess gets your number right or you will be waiting till the cows come home<U+200D>
