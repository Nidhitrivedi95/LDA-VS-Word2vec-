IfdwBSEuDK3fKvVHVX9k0A Great place for vegetarians.  They also have fish and chicken items (2-3 items).  Natural, local and organic.  Made from scratch. Variety and options..... They offer choices way beyond the usual boring salads and wraps and sandwiches.  These guys know that there is more to a salad than lettuce, tomatoes and dressing.  Need I say more about the food???
Ambience is nice.  Gives off a vibe of small and hip place. Seating and walking isles are bit congested, but its fine once u r seated.  Servers are friendly and were able to answer questions about the food.  Service was also good.  
Portions are sufficient.  Most of us are used to seeing giant portions and carrying doggy boxes after meals.    But this place has just the right amount of food for you.  And because its good quality mostly natural food, it does not leave you feeling heavy and sick at the end.
Prices could be a little lower....but they are offering what others are not at this point in this locality.
Definitely recommend that you go and check it out.  Usually u can find restaurant.com coupons for this place.
