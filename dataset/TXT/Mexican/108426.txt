frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A Tacos are authentic! Salsa bar is awesome. There can be a bit of a wait but when you get to your table they already have chips there waiting for you ! Burritos / burros are huge and they grill the tortilla, nice touch. Servers are awesome but a little short staffed.
Try the tamarindo margarita!!
