xw6G0T2VQZAtta6RcZoAOQ Café Rio is a clean looking café, nice atmosphere, but the food wasn't that good compared to other Mexican restaurants for the same price. I ordered online, about an hour ahead and the food still wasn't ready when I arrived. The girl at the order pickup window did not acknowledge me as she was speaking to her boyfriend, and wasn't until the manager came over that I received any attention. The manager was polite, apologized for the inconvenience and offered me a free drink, but I won't be back.
