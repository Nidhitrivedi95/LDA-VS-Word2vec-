kbTAyySlUZrTAr0nJOjiUw We visited Coyotes's on our trip to Vegas in August and ordered their steak, chicken and shrimp fajitas with rice and beans, the portions are large so my husband and I shared the plate they were so so so good.  I had a a mango margarita which was yummy.  For dessert my husband and I ordered the fried ice cream, it was AWESOME!!! 

The service was great our server was very attentive.  We will definitely come back on another trip to Vegas. Great ambiance, food, family atmosphere and clean.  100% better than the buffet we ate at on the strip.
