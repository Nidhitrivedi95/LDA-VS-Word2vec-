xpAm-NN8JQbL5JdBal_Ptg Shame on me for not writing this review sooner!

I have never met such a wonderful employee named Bambie that works the night shift at the drive thru! She is someone that you would expect to see working at Chickfila her attitude is just that great! She is a shining star and I hope management has given her the recognition she deserves!

So when I first moved here and hadn't gotten groceries yet, we came from breakfast late night and there was Bambie at the drive thru window super friendly and she got our complicated our right the first time!! My order is very complicated because I don't like a bunch of stuff on my breakfast burrito! 

Not to mention this Del Taco has be the freshest and most delicious compared to the all the ones I've eaten at! Nothing is ever too salty, the food tastes fresh and doesn't feel like it was sitting under a lamp! I have 0 complaints about this location! ^__^
