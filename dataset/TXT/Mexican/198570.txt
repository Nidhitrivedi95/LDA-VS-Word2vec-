P8IsTiHq5Hesa6UPL604ww Great food! I was pleasantly surprised to find a taco stand...inside a restaurant! The food tastes authentic just like it came from a truck :) 
The only downside is on Taco Tuesday, the asada tacos are not included. Sad face. I've heard other tacos are just as good but have yet to try. Their beans and rice are great!

Clean and hip atmosphere. They have sugar skull paintings on the walls. Oh and they serve alcohol, which might be a plus if you like happy hour and tacos?
