YTqtM2WFhcMZGeAGA08Cfg The Vegas seafood and hangover spot four times now and still doesn't disappoint. Little hole in the wall but has awesome food. Usually I come on Sunday's after a night of partying. Food is great and micheladas are on point. If your not craving beer, try the mangoniada. Only thing if you go on Sunday, try to get there before 12 because it starts filling up afterward. Will definitely make it back soon!
