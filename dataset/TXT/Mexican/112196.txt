G6BwYw_0_atLPTzI1uokIA The service staff was very very nice. Our food came out almost immediately.  They have an insanely good nacho/queso combo that is out of this world. The three stars are honestly for the beverage pours.  I used to be a bartender and I know a decent margarita or shot of tequila when I taste one or see one. They are a little skimpy on the alcohol and very heavy on the mixers. Also, in an environment like this, you'd think they would have a jukebox of some kind which they do not. But the ambient music is just fine. 
 they have indoor and outdoor seating as well as a fully stocked bar with decent sized televisions to catch news or the most current game. I definitely like this restaurant and will be returning at some point.
