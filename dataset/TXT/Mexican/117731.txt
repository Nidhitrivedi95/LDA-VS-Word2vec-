gOpOoZgrF2shRLCBBzO3Mw My son and his wife are in town and he wanted a burrito so I found this place on Yelp. So today we went for lunch, I ordered a crunch beef taco and a fish taco with a side of beans. My son got the California burrito and my daughter in law got the carne asada fries. We all agreed that the food was good and well priced. Why I gave it 3 stars...the girl at the window seemed to be annoyed, irritated, hung over...I'm not sure but she certainly shouldn't be dealing with customers. She was not friendly, refused to smile and was really rude and short. I had to go back to the window so I could get a fork for my beans and so I tapped on the window and she looked up and said something and then got up and opened the window...no, how can I help you or is everything okay...nothing. I asked her if I could please have fork so she took 3 steps back got and fork and handed to me. I told her thank you and she again didn't smile, wouldn't look at me and literally went ummhumm and shut the window. Not sure if I'll go back simply because she had an awful attitude and it's hard to be nice to people who aren't nice when they are in a customer centric environment. Oh and I left a tip because I'm nice and I hope it has to be shared with the cool staff because they all looked happy and they are the ones doing actual labor.
