ZAqgv1gply0m_4fHAIffWA Was hoping that the tacos were better, but not worth the $4 per taco.

I'm staying at the Palms for a conference and needed a quick bite. Ordered the grilled fish and grilled shrimp tacos.

The lady who took my order was great. Friendly, helpful and let me know when the food would be ready. I got the tacos Baja style (cabbage and sauce). The fish taco was okay (3/5) but retangular fish portions? At least it flaked like real fish. The shrimp taco was disappointing (2/5) as there was like 3-4 shrimp. The cabbage and sauce would make most things tasty, but wanted more seafood for the price. 2.5 Star.



I might try it out one more time, but will try the Earl sandwich place first.
