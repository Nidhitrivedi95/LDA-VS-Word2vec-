scLvLqVVIOWZbVT-exGjjg Visiting North Carolina from New York and stopped into Carrburritos for a little mexican cuisine with my friend, as per her recommendation. 

There are many different options to choose from. Carrburritos offers many "fillers" to add to your meal. I got a salad bowl with tomoatoes, onions, carnitos, black beans, guacomole and cheese. They gave me chips on the side, was great to dip into the bowl or into their many salsa options. Once you place your order and pay, the servers will walk over your meal. My friend and I also indulged in a pitcher of margaritas. While they were tasty, they were very sweet in taste and weak on the tequila. 

All staff members were very sweet. They went out of their way to say hello, check-in during the meal, and create conversation (of course our convo related to my New Yorker-ness and my horrible comparison of the restaurant to Chipotle, haha). 

I really enjoyed that they had some outdoor seating and their location. You can do a little shopping or sit outside with a pitcher of margaritas when popping in here. This place makes for a nice afternoon!
