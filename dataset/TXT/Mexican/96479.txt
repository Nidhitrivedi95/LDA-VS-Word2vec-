eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw I don't know why I keep coming back here. The Henderson location was so great and this spot just degrades the brand. We waited 30 min to never receive our original order. Eventually it was comp and with a check in you get a free margarita. Overall quality of food was a 3 and service was a 6 at best. Very disappointing.
