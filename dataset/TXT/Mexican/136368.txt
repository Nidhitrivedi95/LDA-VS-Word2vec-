Mexican street corn: This dish didn't seem fresh. The corn looked dark like it had been old and tasted the same way.

Entree
 Al Pastor: pork had good flavor, however there was chunks of burnt pork that was burnt past the point of being edible. Rice was stale. Beans and guacamole were average.

Bottom line: food wasn't fresh, won't go back
