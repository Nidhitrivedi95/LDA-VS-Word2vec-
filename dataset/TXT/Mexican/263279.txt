W537pidoTVQmn9x1GPpxgA One of my favorite places to go now, since i've moved to this uptown PHX area i tell everyone about this place it's amazing, the prices are good as well. they always have something new for you to try! customer service is awesome too, it's a cool little place with good vibes makes you feel like you're not even in phx. very different in a good way!
