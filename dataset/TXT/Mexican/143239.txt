JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg Another Vegas place I would not have found if it were not for Yelp.

El Dorado Cantina is a great chill place to have a meal, a drink, or just hang with friends. It is a large restaurant with a lot of open space. Great bar with tons of High def televisions. 

The food here is good but not amazing, in my opinion. The delicious items were the table side guacamole, street tacos, and the conchinita pibil....oh yeah the pitchers of margaritas are pretty solid.

I like that they use organic meats and non gmo products...that is pretty amazing.

Service for us was pretty amazing. Our server Enrique was phenomenal: warm, friendly, attentive.....just great.

Prices are not cheap. The guac was $13 bucks, the conchinita pibil was 25. The real deal were those street tacos....I had the carnitas, carne asada, and conchinita pibil ( spicy baby) for 13 bucks...only bummer is they charge for rice and beans....WTF??? 2.50 extra.

What really brought us was that locals get 25% off the total bill on Mondays for locals....and no I did not go next door for a lap dance....although the bouncer wanted me to take a picture with one of their lovely employees....yeah that would sit well with my fam!
