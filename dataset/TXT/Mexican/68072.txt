BIbjBxoiJLS8CnNsSP64TQ What a pleasant surprise. I got the signature "360 Gourmet Burrito" with chicken and it was hot, tasty, and filled with quality ingredients and sophisticated flavors. Minus one star for the ambience and zombie like demeanor of staff. Definitely best fast airport food I've had in as long as I can remember.
