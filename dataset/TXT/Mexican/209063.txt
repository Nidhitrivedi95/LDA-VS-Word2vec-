QF2P3oJqCJC9z0TPDDFVxw I visited DJ's Taco Bar on my last trip to Vegas and just returned for a second time. Both experiences at the Taco Bar were exceptional. No complaints here, some of the cheapest food you can find on the strip and it is tasty. I definitely recommend the $2 tacos with whatever meat of your choosing. Carne Adams fries are amazing as well.
