M8S7poDhCIzqQx1--GB-ww The server was very nice In tune with the style of the place !  It has this lovely vibe like you are traveling back in time with the music from pulp fiction . I got the grilled fish sandwich with avocado and diced pineapple on house made milk bun. The grilled tilapia has a nice smoky flavor fresh off the grill but sadly is under seasoned .  But the worst part is the bun it was very dense seems the moisture just trapped inside the bun and made it sort of gummy texture like under baked and it might be better if it were put on flat top and buttered it . Flavor wise since it was under seasoned made it taste bland . Maybe add some mayo would work ...

Cappuccino was excellent .
