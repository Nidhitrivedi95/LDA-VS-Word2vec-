Iu2ZINWwyrt9gXliykBEKQ You might as well get Taco Bell.

Milagro is an upscale Mexican Cantina. I don't see a problem with the concept but I was quite disappointed with the execution.

You know you have a problem when your server at a so called authentic Mexican restaurant doesn't even speak Spanish. If I am paying so much for an authentic Mexican experience, I want my server to be Mexican (or Latin American at most).  If I wanted Mexican food served by white people, I would have gone to Taco bell.

Milagros Restaurant and Cantina is ridiculously overpriced. They charge $12 dollars for tiny flavourless taco.  Keep in mind that you can get a delicious taco at Tacos El Asador for $2.50. (And your food will be served by someone who actually speaks Spanish!)

The dish presentation leaves a lot to be desired. I ordered some Enchiladas with Mole and the dish looked very messy and unappealing. The enchiladas were unbelievably bland and tasteless. They fell apart way too easily.

There's nothing miraculous about Milagro. Except for the fact that it will take a miracle to convince me to go again.

Save some money. Go to Tacos El Asador on Bloor/Christie instead.
