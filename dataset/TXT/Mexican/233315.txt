SSg2JXBC-H3-9I_sWW6MQA These are the best tamales in Mesa.  Delicious food, friendly quick service, and great prices.  I pick up the tamales to go but you can eat them there just as well. Take some home and put them in the freezer.  You'll never be at a loss if you have unexpected company for dinner.
