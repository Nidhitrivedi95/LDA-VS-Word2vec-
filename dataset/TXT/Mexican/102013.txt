eYeFOcNJO2iTNPCPi8XAxw I love the concept - it really is a snack bar. There's no entrees or main courses, but instead a lot of appetizer or snack dishes like nachos or tacos.

The food was good, but it didn't blow me away. I'd definitely recommend the nachos as the chips were amazing. We tried the chicken tacos and deep fried avocado tacos which again, were good but we wouldn't come back for. Drinks were really good, I got the Caesar's Caesar and a couple shots from their $3 daily rail bar.

Space was pretty small, but once we were seated we didn't notice it. I think it'll make a big difference in summer when they can open the patio so we can spread out.

Would definitely recommend the place, it looks like a lot of people love it. We dropped in for a few quick drinks before catching a show at Tarragon Theatre which is just around the corner
