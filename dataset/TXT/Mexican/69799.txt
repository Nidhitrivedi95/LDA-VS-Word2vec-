bt0ZUJWmAJhjYmfPCzgRmQ I had credit from Restaurant.com and decided to buy a voucher for this restaurant/bar. It's easy to miss, so be on the lookout for a small sign and the laundromat next door. We could hear the karaoke as we walked along the sidewalk. My hubs and I gave each other a glance of apprehension, but me being a stickler for deals and following through, we ventured in. It's a pretty narrow place with some seating in front then a long bar with more seating behind on a raised level. Not fancy, leaning towards dive-ish.  There were a few people karaoking at the bar. We were greeted and took a seat in a booth on the raised level. It didn't matter where we sat, it was pretty loud in there. Oh, were we praying for good food! 

Service was prompt and helpful. The menu was pretty much all over the place, delving into Italian, Japanese, American, and Mexican dishes.  We ordered tacos since we are a bit of taco buffs. There was a variety to choose from: carnitas, asada, pastor, nopales, tofu, campechano-to name a few. We ordered a dinner of two tacos, rice and beans for $8 and two tacos at $2 a piece. The tacos were deliciosos! The tortillas were a bit smaller than other locations, but good meat flavors.  In between polka and Selena karaoke songs, we both agreed that this would be a place to try again.
