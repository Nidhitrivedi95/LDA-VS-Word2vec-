twqDp5T5eXXt6ZipLvECRw I've been coming to this taco bell for over a year, and lately customer service is getting worse. Not only that, but the order is not always complete. I ordered 3 things of the menu, and when I got home, I realized that there was only 2 of them in the bag. I also wasn't aware that the ingredients in the bean burrito had change. If I would of known, I wouldn't have ordered them. Will think twice before coming to this taco bell again.
