44IAhkyHsBGMrggWm1HICw Perfect place for brunch with friends on a Sunday... friendly service, good margaritas, and a wide selection of food. I had the trio of tacos and flautas. They were solid dishes. Friends had vegetarian enchiladas, carnitas, and the table favorite - Enchiladas de Pollo con Mole. Reasonable prices and a great location... happy to see thm expanding to downtown.
