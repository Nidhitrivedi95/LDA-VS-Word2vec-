cwCLcQns_SSExsBCzWNQDA The end of an era.  We've been coming here for almost 20 years, and I think it has hit the lowest point ever.  Salsa bar has disappeared behind the counter.  Even worse, it tasted like rotten tomatoes, I literally spit it out.  Chicken was cold.  Cheese dip is a solid mass.  So disappointing.  We will not be back. :-(
