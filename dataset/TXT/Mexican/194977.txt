Oto60yDwk1z72WmfWEYrjg Don't order the seafood salad if your hungry. It's just a few shrimp and scallops on lettuce and tomato for $13.95. My wife said the chicken tacos were the best she's ever had. Not the best Mexican restaurant but we live the SouthPoint. Had their huge burrito tonight with char broiled steak. Very good.
