uBGPTzye3wrxZPf54AXuFg Food is incredible!! I had lunch burrito of steak, green beans, black beans, and rice. The rice has an amazing aroma that you "taste" more through the smell in your nose as you are eating. Meat perfectly seasoned, black beans not too salty, and green beans are perfectly crunchy. Top that with a great view of Lake Erie, and you're set!! Anytime I am back in Cleveland, I will definitely be here!!
