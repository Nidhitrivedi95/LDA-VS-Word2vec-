ST66dWiUqYnvrD7zT4QBNw The green chili is good to runny for my liking but flavor is good. I'm giving 3 stars because it's really pricey I wasn't expecting to pay $14 dollars and change for a burrito chips and drink. there's no lunch specials I'll keep going back because it is tasty but with that price I'd have to be really craving it. I hope this does not offend the owners but if you had a decent lunch special that incl everything you'd see me every week.
