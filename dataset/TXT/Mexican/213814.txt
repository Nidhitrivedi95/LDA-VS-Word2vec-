QwPt--ZmXlSHq_UhUYpIYw Love this addition to Downtown Chandler! Have been a few times now and have tried different things on their menu to say that you cannot go wrong with their street tacos. The meat is always delicious, whether asada, carnitas, grilled shrimp, etc, and the veggies in the tacos as always fresh, crispy and a delightfully complementary of the meats. The tacos do get a bit messy when you eat because the tortillas are street taco sized but I don't mind because that is how street tacos are supposed to be. Also, their housemade queso and chips are yummy and a generous portion. Their lunch specials for $10 with rice and beans are a good value. A casual and delicious experience, I am getting hungry thinking about it!
