DKXUkIrFnMUMF535gf-dPA The name says it all ! I would come here just to get an agua Fresca! Seriously they are amazing and you can get all kinds of combinations! I did Pineapple and watermelon and my friend did mango and pineapple! Omg so good! Would definitely come back and try the cucumber flavor and the horchata. On to food the menu is super easy to navigate and the prices are great here. It's the same prices as these other Taco chains with higher quality food! I ordered the shrimp platter, and the shrimp cocktail. Both were super tasty! The corn we ordered was okay I don't really like the fact that they grill
It cause it tastes a little burnt but other than that I have no complaints. This location was the one on Tropicana and Rainbow! Will be coming back to eat here again.
