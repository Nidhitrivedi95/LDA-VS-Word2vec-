ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA Update: after seeing my initial one-star review, the owner reached out on Yelp and asked that I give him a call. I spoke to him today and he was very helpful. He clearly explained the changes that going on with their ticketing system, but fully took responsibility for the fact that things should've gone better during our meal. He invited us back to give it another try on the house, and I told him I really appreciated the offer but more importantly the acknowledgment of the frustration that we had. Upgrading to four stars for solid recovery.
