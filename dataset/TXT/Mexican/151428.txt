JTstxpVRd_uSD3hCxzrEvw Fabulous. Great atmosphere, great service (great attire), great music, great food. The salsa is really good as are the chips. And they were hot. Very good rice. Very good refried beams. The carnitas were excellent. No "piggy" taste either as is sometimes the case with carnitas. No odd or stale flavor in anything. A huge amount of food too. All this at a half hour before closing on a Saturday night! I won't bother trying anywhere else while I'm here in Cleveland (n. Olmstead). 

Omg! The flan is amazing (writing this as I eat). I can tell it's homemade from scratch  in the kitchen. Sometimes I think mex restaurants have their flan brought in. There was a hint I clove in the sauce. Wow what a nice little touch that was. Normally at Mexico places I order it without the extra toppings...only the caramel sauce. But I forgot this time. The whipped cream andd fizzled chocolate sauce was not distracting however. Next time I'll order it plain so I can really taste the custard flavor. 

If only they had wifi...my att signal here is next to nothing. Guess I'll post this down the road. Lol
