XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg The food was delicious!  We came for brunch this past weekend and I ordered the Mesa burger.  Definitely helped with the hangover.  Our waiter was as nice as could be, but it was very obvious that he was overworked.  He was covering an entire section of about 10 tables (all with 4+ guests) and he had a hard time providing enough attention to each one.  This was not his fault, but management's.  We ordered the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido the second we sat down--it arrived nearly an hour later with our entrees.  Our drinks took about 30 minutes to be served.  All in all, brunch with 5 people took nearly 2.5 hours.  Be prepared to wait...and wait.
