RUxAdd3mmNkejoTAX2YIDw I am striking out on restaurants this week.  I love Patron's and I have no officially been to all of their locations.  I live very close to the Shadyside and Fox Chapel locations and my boyfriend lives near the Monroeville (our favorite) location.  I came here with my dad for lunch today and I have to say, this has been my least favorite of all.

The chips, which are usually fresh and light and crispy, came out thick, overcooked and stale.  The salsa was freezing cold. Already not off to a great start.  My dad and I both ordered their fajita taco salad (my favorite/go to item at the other locations); mine with chicken, his with beef.  He specifically asked if the beef would be shredded or ground and the server confirmed shredded.  ABout 15 minutes later, our very nice server arrived with our meals.  I knew from the start it didn't look right.  Normally the chicken fajita taco salad has strips of chicken and mine was shredded.  The server could tell I seemed confused, and when I asked if it was fajita chicken salad he said yes.  My dad had ground beef on his.  We ate anyway and they didn't taste bad, but it wasn't the normal preparation and we had to be back at work in a timely manner.

We got our bill when we were finished and were charged for two taco salads, just as we had assumed.  The overall experience was just kind of annoying. It was extremely loud in there plus the food wasn't up to the other locations standards how I was used to.  Our server was very very nice and attentive, but I think from now on, I will stick to Monroeville or Shadyside until there is a little more consistency throughout the chain.
