m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw Last Friday, the 16th, we dined for the first time at Pancho's and due to high prices, instead chose happy hour in the bar.   But alas!  The prices were so much more than all the other happy hours in town that we decided to split an order of $17 FAJITAS on regular menu.  I wanted a margarita but my only choice was $7.50 so I opted for a $5.00 Negro Modelo.   The chips and salsa were very good and so were the nicely charred chicken fajitas, an ample portion.

The best part of our experience was our very competent & personable server Claudia who belongs in a 5 star restaurant.  We also appreciated the ambiance and the fact that their TV screens are terrific & well situated for watching a game.

With the huge population of Mexican restaurants in our city, as well as happy hours at almost any restaurant, Pancho's has much competition.  They could begin by dropping the prices and changing the music.  We're waiting (way too long) for this town to come out of the clouds & take advantage of fine music for ALL generations.  Let's begin to EDUCATE, think outside the box, & not do "business as usual."
