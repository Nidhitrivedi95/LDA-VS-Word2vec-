vMyeUHW3QxbXD4_KxmwduA We actually go here pretty regularly. Super reasonable, pleasant staff and patio, good food. We've actually stopped going to Don Pedro's when we want Mexican as we've had more inconsistent experiences there and it's very loud. Our most recent visit at Salsas we sat in a booth near a large table of after work folks who were apparently IT/Enterprise Architects for a local firm. They were a bit loud discussing business, which, since I work with EA Directors, I leave work to get away from such convo, but not Salas's fault - maybe sit couples away from larger tables/ppl with small kids when not crowded. Also, sometimes the table set up (as in this large party) make it difficult to move in the dining room/get to the door.

All in all, we really like Salsas and will continue visiting fairly often.
