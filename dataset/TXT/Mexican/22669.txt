2j78b8m1w4Sr2GVGCzFBtQ Loved it!!! Place is fairly new and super cool looking. Great date place for drinks and apps. We used the Yelp offer for a free Chipolte queso dip. It's a little thin but delicious. They give you crispy hot chips and the salsa was perfect. It wasn't hot, which I find is the case at a lot of other places, which is annoying. I ordered the lunch special where you pick two out of three street tacos, I got The braised beef taco and the coke tacos. It came with rice and beans, which were delicious!  I wasn't a fan of the braised beef, but the pork was good. Frank got Al Pastor carnitas. I liked those better. You get three of those but NO rice and beans, but more expensive. Our frozen margheritas were Delish. It's pretty authentic And we really liked it. We'll be back. OLE!
