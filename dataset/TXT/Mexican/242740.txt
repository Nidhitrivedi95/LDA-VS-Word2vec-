TG2QAcrevOmXDuCQQFlGew Tried this place out for the first time last week with high hopes as Mexican food is my absolute favorite cuisine! 

I walked in and was taken back by the lack of customer service that came from the staff. I ordered a taco salad and a hard shell taco on the side. The one plus is the food didn't take more than 15 mins to get to our table.

Once it arrived I looked at my "taco salad" and thought this isn't a taco salad, there was no hard shell, beans or nothing! It was a plate of shredded lettuce, ground beef, cheese and a small dollop of sour cream. I asked the young man who brought it if I could have ranch he said they didn't have it. I said ok can I have thousand island he says sorry we don't have any dressing. I'm thinking to myself how do you have salads on your menu with no dressing available?! 

My taco looked appetizing until I realized it wasn't even hard shell but a flour tortilla that had been fried. I was hoping for a corn hard shell. Plus it was overt greasy and the salsa on it was terrible! 

I left unimpressed and felt it was way overpriced. I don't plan on going back, save your money and go to Las Fuentes or Rio Mirage.
