rp1TgQObnIIRZw3fHWSwJA This place has pretty good Mexican food for being in the Midwest. I like their chips and salsa. The mole sauce is pretty good. The tortillas they use are not freshly made and they are American tortillas, which makes a huge difference in taste. I don't like their rice at all. It has a funny taste to it. it almost tastes like it stored in plastic bins , I taste some kind of weird plastic or chemical in the rice every single time I go. I don't think they cook the food fresh to order because it comes out of the kitchen so fast. 
The blended margaritas are very good. I am Mexican so my Mexican food standards are high. This place is just ok.
