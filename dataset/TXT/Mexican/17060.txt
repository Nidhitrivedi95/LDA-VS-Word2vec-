1HfkEkNhI6XJXkgrCTBKpw We got the pork nachos ($12.5) and a burger ($10.5)- nachos were fine. The ingredients were fresh but the cheese sauce tasted more like flour than cheese. The burger was fine (way overcooked) but not memorable.

I was impressed with their seasonal beer selection! It's rare I get to have an Avery seasonal. Yay! However, they need to mention when a beer isn't a 16 ounce pour. I totally get a 9 % ABV may be a smaller pour, but just give a girl a head's up.

All in all, probably won't be back with all the other delicious options on Carson.
