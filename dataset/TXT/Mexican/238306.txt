szlIcLQE7K-1JuKeJIRKsQ Really overpriced, flavorless Mexican food. It was still edible... and there was a lot of food... but blegh. The pico de gallo was the only thing I actually remembered liking. The meat was really rubbery and overseasoned, and the beans and such seemed like they came out of a can. Maybe it's because I've been spoiled by the uber cheap, hole-in-the-wall mexican places elsewhere in the U.S... where the servers barely speak English. 

Our server was super nice though.. :T 

I just know I won't go back, which makes me sad.. I would like to support all of my neighborhood's businesses.
