tUsqTg8FWA37DeyaGcBMbg What a wonderful experience we had at Fieldstone for dinner. I had a friend visiting from NYC and wanted to have a special night between friends. That is exactly what we had. The wine list was consice and exactly what we wanted. We went for the 8 course tasting menu and we were blown away. Our table had some food requirements like one vegan and one vegetarian and 2 eat-everything-eaters. The chef treated us like premiere guests. Each one of us had unforgettable food journeys. The food was some of the best most creative dishes I have ever had. This is just simply one of the best restaurants in the city! We had ingredients we have never heard of, we looked at food presentation we had never seen, we enjoyed flavour combinations we've never thought of. The personal touches by the chef and team only enhanced the experience for us. This is not just food but it is also discovery, a lesson, and an experience. Bravo
