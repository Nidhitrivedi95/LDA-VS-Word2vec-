9t8PEynZGVCG1EjOQr1xBA This was our first time here, but definitely not the last!  The pastor tacos were delish!! Really friendly staff, clean, good prices, and fresh made to order food.  The owner actually came out and talked to us while we were waiting for our order, really nice guy.  We've been looking for a good taco spot since we moved here a few months ago and we've found it!  I plan to try the Windy City fries next.
