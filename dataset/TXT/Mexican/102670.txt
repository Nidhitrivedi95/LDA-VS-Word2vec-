F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw This place came so highly recommended to me, I couldn't wait to go. 
     I have to say that I was a little disappointed. 
     We got the guac sampler and it was good but I honestly make better guac myself.  We got the salsa trio and those were really good.  Homemade chips were very good.
     I then got the chorizo fundido.  It was kind of gross.  You're supposed to make little tacos with the corn tortillas they give you but it was just one giant mass of melted shredded cheese.  I had to cut it with a knife.  And underneath was a TON of grease.  I am a chorizo fanatic and theirs was overcooked.  
     I then got the atun.  The tuna was ok, seasoned nice.  The server told me that the recommended temperature is rare and I said medium rare was fine, that I don't want  cold fish...It was cold inside and poorly plated with some slivers of luke warm onions and jalapenos underneath.  I was most excited about the candied jalapenos but they just tasted like wet green bell peppers.
     My girl got the scallop entree.  The scallops were cooked nice and seasoned nice but not washed very well, the bite I had was gritty.  The menu says it is served with poblano creamed corn and horseradish crema.  But there were tomatoes and peppers under the scallops.  And maybe a few kernels of corn.  It was not plated well either; everything was red except for the frita.  Maybe it was our cook's first day.  You'd think the expediter would catch these things.
     My other friend got the empanadas and those were not only delicious but plated colorfully and creatively.  
     Total bill was $108.  I will try this place one more time but I'm a little apprehensive.  
     They do however have the greatest habanero hot sauce ever!  Bought a bottle to take home.
