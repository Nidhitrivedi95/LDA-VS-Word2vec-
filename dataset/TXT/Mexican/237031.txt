SW6ZQk22G1_CV81_gfnvNQ People go back and forth between comparing Grand Electric and La Carnita - it's no surprise. The two offer pretty much the same concept. But you will have two entirely different experiences. 

- Food: Grand Electric has food that is slightly more sophisticated, but they way they've been going downhill lately, La Carnita isn't far of the mark. 
-Service: When you compare, la carnita isn't as good as Grand Electric, but when you don't compare, it's just good enough. 
- Size: It's a big restaurant with enough seating. You don't have to wait in line at 6pm for a 2 hour wait. Let's get serious, it's a taco at the end of the day. The size at la carnita makes it a place you can hang out with your friends, drink, snack and laugh. Grand electric does not. The music is intentionally loud in both places to get you to leave sooner rather than later, but somehow, la carnita just has a better more hang out vibe. 
- Drinks: La Carnita doesn't have nearly the drink menu grand electric does, but your wallet will thankyou at the end of the night. 
- Cost: La Carnita won't set you back as much as grand electric, but it's cheap food at the end of the day in both places.

Overall:
Go to la carnita for an easy night, don't expect gourmet food that will blow your mind, but expect good flavour at a good price and a nice buzz...oh and go with a good group of friends. This isn't so much a date place as it is a hang place.
