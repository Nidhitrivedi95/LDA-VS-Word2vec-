-ilCufjKjeswCLyIrCtuqQ Pro:only place open at Bally's after 3 am.

Cons: Waited 20min At table prior to server taking our order. 15 min later our nachos still had not arrived. I flagged down the manager who went and checked on our order. It had not been placed.  Then when food arrived, there was no beef on the beef nachos!!  I asked the server about it and he went back to kitchen and got us a bowl of ground beef.  Gee thanks!  I should have taken a pic of this but was so mad and on verge of walking out.

Needless to say, I won't be eating here ever again!
