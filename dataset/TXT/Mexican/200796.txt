pFZnJgXWJ1YlnDxdMhv1iw Good place for tacos of their take on 'em with great taste, I've been coming to this one all my life and it's usually good service and fast with what you expect from Taco Bell. The 1 thing I have to put on here though is FOR THE LOVE OF GOD would the franchise HQ PLEASE renovate this restaurant!!! It's older than I but holy smokes this building in desperate need of a make over from anyone! There's a lowes next door there's no excuse!!
