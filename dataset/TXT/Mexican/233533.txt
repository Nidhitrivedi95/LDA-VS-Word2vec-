ST66dWiUqYnvrD7zT4QBNw Just had lunch at Rito's in Surprise and I can't say enough good things about the place.  We both had the green chili burrito with green sauce and it was delicious.  This is authentic Mexican food.  The burrito was huge.  The tortilla was fresh (no hard spots from a microwave) and it was filled with tender beef and lots of creamy green chili sauce.  Then it was totally covered with cheese (not just a little sprinkle) and a huge portion of the creamy green chili sauce.   We had a side of beans and we were fighting over them because they were so good.  This is GOOD food!  Can't wait to go back and try the enchiladas.
