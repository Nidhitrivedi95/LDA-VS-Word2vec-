ZkUWOdBA4T7pdUhT0dkRzQ We went this past Saturday. I wanted a shrimp burrito and they don't make one. I was going to order the shrimp enchilada instead.  Our sweet waitress asked the chef if he would do a burrito with shrimp. He came over and was very pleasant and not bothered by my pickiness.  We designed a great, simple burrito.  Our food was fresh, delicious and filling. I don't recommend always ordering off the menu. But I love how they stepped up to accommodate. It was well worth the money and generous tip.
