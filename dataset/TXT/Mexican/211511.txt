qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A DW is one of my favorite restaurants in town! I normally go on Saturday brunch and special order a Cesar salad with the spicy fried chicken breast, amazing. Everything on their menu is wonderful, and the bottomless mimosas at brunch are worth every penny!

Just came to visit new location, food amazing as always. Iced tea is now available unsweet but $4 is a little high. When paying the bill we saw they now add 20% gratuity (we were a table for 2) if I wasn't paying attention the waiter would have gotten a 40% tip. Not a fan of that and it compelled me to write this PAY ATTENTION to your bill!!
