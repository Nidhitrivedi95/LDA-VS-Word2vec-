cKgUCzMGuRgkbKXUsgeXUw We came to this restaurant as travelers from Portland, having been raised in California, looking for a decent Mexican meal. However, we were on foot and none of the four-star restaurants were in reach, so we decided on the lovely outdoor patio of Barrio Queen.

I concur with the 3.5-star rating. If I only had the chips, salsa and guacamole and my Margarita Brava (jalapeño-infused), it would have been a 4-star. Unfortunately, I selected the Queso do Cabra salad as a healthy complement to my indulgence. I liked the mixed greens, which were fresh. The idea of the roasted corn and poblanos was a good one, but the vinaigrette was bitter and didn't go with the salad and the goat cheese seemed like an afterthought. My husband had three tacos, which he said were good and are definitely more the direction you want to go if you visit Barrio Queen.

Their patio is lovely and there is a lot of foot traffic nearby and few cars, so ambiance was a definite plus. Service was good.
