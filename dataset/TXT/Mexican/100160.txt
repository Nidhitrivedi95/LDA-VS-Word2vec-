eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg I would give zero stars if I could. I thought the food was WAY overpriced, but it made sense once I looked around. The majority of the people were not Mexican so they might not be aware that a large pitcher of Horchata could be made with even less than $5.  When I visited, a Coke bottle of Horchata was almost $5. Nevertheless,  I thought I would give the food a try because it did look good.  The manager was our waiter, and I asked him what Longaniza was. He said he didn't have time to explain what that was.  I'm sorry for wanting to know what I was going to eat. I didn't know if I should laugh or just walk out.  In the end I walked out and went to El Guero Canelo on 51st Ave and McDowell.   IF YOU'RE LOOKING UPSCALE MEXICAN FOOD CAFE POCA COSA IN TUCSON!
