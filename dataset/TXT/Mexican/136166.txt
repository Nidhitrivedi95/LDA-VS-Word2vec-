iOt7ebp4Zy-5YUjHL1rbmQ We came here because Mucha Lucha was closed. I wanted to like it, but honestly couldn't get past how unsatisfied I was. I got a carne asada burrito that was overpriced considering how small it was. I was mostly bummed about how much flavor the meat lacked. Didn't even taste like there was salt and pepper. The salsa bar was my only hope and that failed me too. I would go to Filibertos over this place. Sucha bummer.
