eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw This place is absolutely yummy! We had the queso, nachos, enchiladas, and tacos. Everything was full of flavor and was a reasonable price. Our waiter was very friendly and made our dining experience enjoyable. Definitely would recommend this place, and we will be back next time we are in Las Vegas.
