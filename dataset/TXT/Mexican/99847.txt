eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg This is the first time that I have ever written a review.  My husband and I went to Barrio Cafe last night. The service was efficient and pleasant, but the margarita and the food was super mediocre. I guess that the biggest reason I jumped in to comment was the $19 margarita. First, the drink was awful. Really acidic, but with almost no flavor. My husband ordered one too and immediately just stopped drinking his and ordered a beer because "they won't be able to screw that up". I tried to salvage mine with a floater of chamborg ($9). It was better, but $19? 

$12 for a bowl of corn chowder that had one lonely and awkwardly floating shrimp in there. My husband and I both agreed that it had a familiar taste and consistency,  but couldn't put our finger on it, until I shouted "cream of wheat". That was it, a bowl of near tasteless gruel at almost a room temperature. We couldn't figure out if it was a hot soup or supposed to be cold and sat too long.  

The queso fundido was the other app. nothing to complain about, but not great. 

We both ordered tacos (because they were out of the pork dish they are known for at 6 pm). The tacos were super mediocre. Again ... three little street tacos on greased corn tortillas. I had shrimp which was tasty enough. My husband had steak. His lacked any real flavor. 

The spicy fries served with the meal was the best part. Also, I thought that the chips were good and the salsa was amazing. 

I am always looking for great spots and this most definitely was not it.  $100 later ... NOT impressed.
