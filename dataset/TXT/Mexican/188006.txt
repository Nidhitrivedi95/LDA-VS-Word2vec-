o5Mofj5KJkYAMs_fhxftpg I am a big Seoul Taco fan back home in STL. I'd previously checked out the Chicago location (rock solid) and in CoMo (college town - did the namesake proud), so while in Champaign I gave this location a whirl. What a disappointment.

I stuck with my tried and true bulgogi steak burrito with kimchi slaw. It lacked its usual killer taste (burrito). The meat was dried or over cooked, and it tasted like a lack of Seoul sauce on it.

I don't know if it was a bad day, shift change, new cooks, etc. But my visit lacked the same Seoul Satisfaction I'm accustomed to with these restaurants. 

Be fresh, stay fresh.
