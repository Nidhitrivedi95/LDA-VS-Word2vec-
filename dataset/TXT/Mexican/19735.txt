1x8_aJQ-iqvymhRK3SNbLg Okay. My boyfriend and I went to this restaurant thinking it was going to be decent based off the reviews. I am usually a super understanding person so please trust me when I say I'm not just posting this to bitch because I have nothing better to do. I go to restaurants frequently and i have to say this was one of the worst ones I've ever been to in my entire life. DO NOT GO HERE.

 Immediately when we walked in on a Saturday at 5:30 pm, there was only one other table in the whole place. It was a nice day out so we decided we wanted to sit on the patio.. When we got out there an employee was smoking right in the patio area and was literally yelling back and forth with the employees inside. There was a beer just sitting on one of the tables outside and we shortly realized that the employees sit around and drink beer and smoke on the patio. A worker about thirty minutes after we had been there walked out to the patio with a beer, drank the full beer, started smoking and then went back inside. Prior to this gentleman walking out and drinking on the job we had ordered another taco.. Our waiter came out and said there would be a delay. We kept looking at the clock and it was thirty minutes before the ONE two inch taco came out. We're pretty sure the gentleman on the patio smoking and drinking was a cook because we never saw him walking around inside so he had to of been in the kitchen for the most part and a few minutes after he went back inside we got our taco... That took the whole thirty minutes he was outside to cook apparently.. 

Last but not least we ordered a queso dish as an appetizer, we didn't receive it till after our main course and it was horribly burned THERE WAS NO CHEESE IN THE "QUESO" THAT WASN'T BURNED AND HARDENED. I'm adding a picture of it.
