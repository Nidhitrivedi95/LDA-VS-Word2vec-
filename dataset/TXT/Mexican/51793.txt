9d7N-I00hu-VkXFry4Da-g 3 stars sums it up well enough. Decent, not great.

Acceptable chips. Decent salsa. Really very good hot sauce.

I had Tampiqueña which is a skirt steak and cheese enchilada. The steak was a bit over cooked and was seasoned with too much pepper. The enchilada was OK. nothing special. The guac was straight forward and good, just pretty skimpy. The carne machaca was disappointing. The menu says, "special seasoning." more like "no" seasoning. 

The service was polite and friendly. The place was clean throughout.

No complaints. Just nothing to call attention to this place that begs for a repeat visit.
