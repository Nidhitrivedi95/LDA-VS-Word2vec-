Kj8rXSpMQlFOP2iWN0fXYA Been to this location and the one on T-bird & 59th. Both are great in terms of food & service. This one actually has a drive thru, which is awesome for those lazy, don't wanna cook days. Their food is so fresh and flavorful. Bonus points for their chips always being fresh and warm, not old and stale like some places. Salsa was a bit too salty but still quite tasty. I ordered the Filete Marinero. It's a hefty tilapia portion smothered with a white Mexican cream sauce cooked with thinly sliced onions. Absolutely delicious! My only gripe is how much of that cream sauce they loaded on. They could lighten up a tiny bit. Despite this, still one helluva dish. 
Rice & beans surprisingly good. I'm a rice snob at Mexican restaurants. I will judge rice and it can determine if I will return to a place. Yup, I said it... I'm a rice judger! Theirs measures up- its fluffy, moist and flavorful. The perfect accompaniment to a good Mexican meal. They also have a full bar with great drink specials. Lotsa good looking desserts that I plan to try at some point. 
Service is always on point, both locations. Such friendly staff. You're doing good, Anaya's! Keep it up!
