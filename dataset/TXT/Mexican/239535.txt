T2tEMLpTeSMxLKpxwFdS3g I'm probably going to make some enemies in Charlotte by not eating this place higher but despite its devoted following, Cabo Fish Taco is overrated and overpriced. I've also noticed that the quality has been steadily declining over a he years. I used to really like it but now it's squarely in 'just ok' territory with me. 

Some of the tacos are good but some are of iffy quality. The crane asada tacos used to be my go to but last time I had then, the meat was incredibly tough. They're seasoned well but that doesn't matter much when the meat is the consistency of a shoe. The tuna isn't fresh tasting so I'd avoid that too. The fried fish tacos and the Mahi tacos are decent.

One of my biggest complaints about this place is the unreasonable prices. Not only are the tacos way overpriced but they also charge five bucks for the tomatillo salsa then don't give refills! The house salsa is free but it's disgusting. I love the tomatillo salsa but I use a lot of salsa and I don't expect to pay ten dollars for salsa alone!

The atmosphere of this place is really fun but the food quality just doesn't measure up to the price tag or the ridiculously long waits. I guess in Noda, you can get away with skewed price to quality ratios since the twenty year old hipsters will flock to you regardless!
