The worst part is they are having a conversation about going as slow as possible with customers so they can catch up. The two ladies that work here were both unapproachable and lacking a sense of urgency. Then we received our foods and the beans were old , dry and crusty( picture attached . The girl with a name tag Cera or Megan as the cook called here was straight up rude and combative . The MOD put water in the burnt beans and was not helping customers at the front . 

Caroline  was eating food on the line and literally walking in circles and has no idea how to help customers . Worst service ever and we will be reaching out to corporate and the General Manager !
