jIzygnVmajEXYmfsBNY_Gw One of the most underrated taco shops in the valley! Great tacos, sauces, prices, and atmosphere! Encourage all to come and visit. Couldn't be more satisfied with the food also the staff and the two beautiful ladies who helped us! 

Also if it's your first time you can try the meats for Free and taste what you want cause they do have variety! 

Thanks Most Wanted Taco Shop!!!!
