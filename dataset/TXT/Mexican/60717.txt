aP2Ma-Wx2lydppntCGhNSg My family and I went there for breakfast today, and after asking our waitress why our meal is taking to long, she answered with "well we are not really a breakfast place" ok so why do you have a breakfast menu? And after our meal got there they forgot the pancakes and I had to actually go up to the counter and ask for it. The food is good, but servers need training.
