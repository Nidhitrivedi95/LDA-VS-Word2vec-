YSYDJTCt5kzY2kKnLNGRiA Sol is located right off Scottsdale road.

The service is super friendly and speedy.

The restaurant is a modern version of Mexican food with a twist. The corn appetizer was amazing.  The carne tacos were tasty, I wasn't a huge fan of the tortillas so ate the meat only.  The tortilla chips are Sols own version.
