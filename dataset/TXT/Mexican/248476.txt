U9iNEzBVCsPLrzoJOwa32Q I am always ready to eat Mexican food specially during lunch so that I can add more protein to my diet. Qdoba is my favorite place for lunch. Most of the time I take out. I like this place because the employee here knows me and he starts making my taco salad the way I like it as soon as I open the door. I ONLY gave 3 star because the manager/owner is always trying to add extra item on your bill with out telling you. It happen to be couple of times so now I have to make sure my bill is correct every time I check out.
