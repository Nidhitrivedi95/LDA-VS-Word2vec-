vnKHXrw585IOH4F3m29yFQ Came here to kick off my bachelorette party. We made a reservation for 8 p.m. but didn't get seated until 8:30. It was after 11 a.m. when the food arrived so that pretty much put a damper on the night. While the manager comp'd the meal because of the lack of service, it spoiled what was supposed to be a special night. Their excuse was that it was busier than normal, which really doesn't fly. It was a Saturday night and we had reservations. Should take more than three hours to get served in a restaurant. Honestly can't even remember the food.
