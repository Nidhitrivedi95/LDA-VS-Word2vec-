nGjqCFbLPeBJe55Mx-nIEw I have this philosophy about recipes at restaurants being uniquely their own version of dishes. I grew up on Roberto's in Las Vegas and to me that is casual Mexican food. Tacos Los Toritos is another universe for some people and I totally dig it. 

The east side of Las Vegas, to me, is anywhere east of Eastern and TLT has some of my favorite street tacos on the east side. Street tacos aka just meat, onion, cilantro, and salsa-nothing fancy. My favorites are their lengua and their tripas. They give you the option of soft or crunchy and their crunchy tripas is the way to go. 

Aside from tacos they have your traditional plate meals with rice and beans, your covered fries or nachos, and your hangover cures like menudo.

What stands out for me at this taco shop versus other places is there agua frescas. These are delicious, refreshing, and made in house. Their horchata isn't my favorite, but try any of their other offerings and you won't be disappointed. My favorite is the cucumber.

One thing people may have a love or hate opinion on is their pickled carrots and jalapeños. They are very mildy pickled and spicy which I happen to like. They aren't like the canned ones I'm used to. 

I know this place is a staple on the east side, but even if you don you live on this side of town, they're worth a trip.
