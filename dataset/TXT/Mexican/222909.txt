RTu_YXj2Za0Jf7rsFEcOhw We are trying this for the first time. Heard great things. Just so happens to be $.99 chicken taco Wednesday. So far, we've waited 30 minutes to get our 7 tacos. No special order. Nothing but the tacos. I swear there are 2 people working here. The nice girl working the counter and the guy in the back making all the food. 
For those of you who haven't been here let me explain the set up. It is fast food- at least in style and set up ( fast is not a word I can use to describe this place). U stand in line, order, get ur food and go to a table that has obviously not been bused in quite some time. 
The tacos are good. Shells look like they were onsite. But not sure it's worth the wait...
