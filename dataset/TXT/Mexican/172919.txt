The other tacos come on wheat tortillas and are grilled like quesadillas. It's kind of weird to have grill marks on tacos. They were tasty, but nothing amazing. Pork and chicken tacos are served with refried beans and rice. Again, good, but nothing amazing. I think possibly the fish taco platter is the way to go, since it uses corn tortillas and served with lime, along with salad and rice.
