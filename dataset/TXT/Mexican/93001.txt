e2ApirIzYID9xIye0r_gKQ Holy Fried Zucchini! This is a newer location to the Centennial Hills area and I finally decided to give this place a try.  Our family has special dietary needs (vegetarians) and was not sure if this place had some options for us to try. I was pleasantly surprised they were able to accommodate the picky eaters in the family.  We went for dinner so burger and fries were calling our name but they also have some sandwiches like pastrami and chicken and they also serve breakfast. I am not sure if that is served all day though.  After finishing ordering they gave the option to half and half our side items.  I chose the zucchini and fry combo.  Holy cow! I was not expecting half logs of fresh fried zucchini.  They were huge but, also delicious.  They gave ranch for dipping which tasted like it was made fresh in house as well.  The fry's did not travel well and were slightly soggy but still edible.  

The one thing I was not expecting was the prices.  I think they are slightly on the expensive side for burger and fry drive thru but the food was made fresh and to order so that is a plus. With a sandwich, fry combo, and drink your looking at $10-12 per person.    I think we will give them another try in the near future but I was looking for affordability.
