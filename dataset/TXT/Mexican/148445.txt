jScBTQtdAt-8RshaiBEHgw What a great little breakfast place! A hidden gem that's for sure! Everything is so fresh and tastes so good! If you are in the area it's a definitely go try, be careful though this place only has about 10 tables so space is very limited. But high recommendation to go try some breakfast food. The chef who is the owner came to the table and couldn't have been a nicer person too. And prices are very reasonable
