EUxbuNT8BYPs_h0vVMy2pg This place was great!!! Clean, friendly place with really good food.  The gentleman who serviced us was very helpful.  He explained the menu and gave us wonderful suggestions. The #11 combo was fantastic!  I would eat that everyday. 

Truly this is a really good place to eat for an awesome price.  The jamica is made fresh.  I got a second cup and added rum to it at home...awesome!
