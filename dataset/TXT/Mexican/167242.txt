LrBDBaGfONR7Kmg8sG38dA Definitely did not realize the restaurant had changed hands until we sat down and noticed there was no margarita menu. Shrimp in the enchiladas was overcooked, shredded beef under seasoned, and the fajita meat on my salad was grey, rubbery and poor quality. Customer service was good, but will probably make the trek down to Gilbert to the actual Rancho de Tia Rosa next time.
