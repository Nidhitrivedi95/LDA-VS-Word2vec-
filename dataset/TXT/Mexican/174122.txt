mlc5N9qL6UYbtcwzVqgmzw Nothing to write home about. First, it has no AC so think about that first. Next, you sit at a table, but there is no waitress service. You order at a window, but if you want a drink, even a soda, you have to order at the bar. The food, nothing special. I ordered a Cobb salad for $13. No turkey, no egg, no bacon, no cheese that I could see, just basically a salad with ham and croutons.   I could go on and on but you probably get the idea. With so many great places in the area, I don't know why anyone would go here.

Also some words of advise. If you see a restaurant with half 1 star reviews and half 5 star reviews, you might want to believe the 1 star reviews.
