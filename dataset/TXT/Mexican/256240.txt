vGDhK2Lc4Np5iZYZ7FG0QA We loved this little restaurant everything is fresh and homemade and there is great pride in presenting good food. I had the chili relleno which was so superior to the tex mex ones. The guav was fresh and chunky, chips home made.  The carnitas was tasty and juicy especially with a few of the spicy onions thrown in. A great neighborhood jewel!
