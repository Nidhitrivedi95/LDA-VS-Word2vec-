P8IsTiHq5Hesa6UPL604ww The carne asada tacos were great. I had a bean burrito and bean tostada and I thought the beans were a little bland. Also the location off Elliot didn't have sopes or dessert. I'm not sure if the other location has it but I saw it on the online menu. Other than that I think it's a great taco spot and still want to try the enchiladas. Can't go wrong here!
