9IupU26SZ9Ivzm90UgFYlw I ordered through orderit.ca and was pretty disappointed. I asked for two bean and cheese burritos, no cheese, no sour cream and to swap the refried beans with their vegetarian black beans. Also ordered extra guacamole.

The burritos arrived with no dairy like I asked for, but also no beans! All they had was bland rice, watery guacamole, bland salsa and sad lettuce, onions and tomatoes. The extra guacamole was also watery and bland.

Maybe they had an off day but I would not order from them again.

If you are in the east end, order from Grillies through justeat.ca -- so much better!
