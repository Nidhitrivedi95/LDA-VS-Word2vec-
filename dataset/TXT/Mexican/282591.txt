XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Was looking for a place to eat and came across Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill. I'm a sucker for celebrity chef restaurants. One thing to note is that on the weekends, they only serve brunch and not a typical lunch menu. That being said, the brunch menu still has a good variety of breakfast and lunch options.

For brunch, I ordered the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash. It was the perfect amount of spicy with the rich hollandaise sauce over the poached eggs and hash combo. It was a nice twist on the typical corned beef hash, with chicken as the meat and a switch to sweet potatoes. I would definitely recommend for a hearty breakfast that is much different from traditional options. 

Another favorite was the plate of mini breads, muffins, and scones that came complimentary before the meal. There was a chocolate scone, something that resembled a jalapeno cornbread, cheesy roll, all were delicious!
