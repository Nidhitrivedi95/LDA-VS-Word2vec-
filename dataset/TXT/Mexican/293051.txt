yVYteK2Ootg37Gh2SIPihA Our restaurant of choice when dining out in De Forest.  Menu seems more authentic than the typical chain Mexican restaurants.  Service for us has always been very friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed and very kid friendly.  Outdoor seating is a big plus on summer evenings and the prices are very reasonable.  I'm usually not much of a chips and salsa fan but I can't get enough of it here.  Not a spicy or chunky salsa, but I personally find it delicious.
