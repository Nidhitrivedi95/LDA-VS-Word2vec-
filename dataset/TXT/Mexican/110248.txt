fVo4uithMrIbNYom48b_fg Honestly- for me the best of the best Mexican places !!!!! First -the balcony-so romantic and nice, feels like you are somewhere else, not in the city for sure!! All lights at night just make you feel worm and comfyfood is amazing , guys are really good to! I even went there for my birthday with friends: everyone was full and happy after "grando" margaritas and huge dishes!! Stuff is great too-there were songs, music and a hatwhat can I say, just go and try-you'll have tones of emotions and some fun too
