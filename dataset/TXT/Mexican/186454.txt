The ratio of meat/cheese/rice/beans is impeccable, and you get to decide how much sauce or lettuce to put on. Just use caution with the very hot sauce that is marked. It is acidic to the point where it will burn your tongue and lips on contact. All of the employees are very friendly and clearly take pride in providing a good dining experience.
