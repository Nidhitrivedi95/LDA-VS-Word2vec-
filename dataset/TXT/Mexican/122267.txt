hEmY0N9HTMvleveS6_YqOg My wife and I went for the first time last night, and had a great time. We were greeted and seated immediately and had chips and salsa 30 seconds later. It was a busy night but all was very clean and comfortable. 

We ordered and had our food hot and ready 5 minutes later. Both of our meals were good and filling. Our waitress was one of the best I've had anywhere and the prices and selection were great too. 

We will be back and wish we had tried this place sooner!
