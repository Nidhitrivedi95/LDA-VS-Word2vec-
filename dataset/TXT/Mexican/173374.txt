The concept for the space is that it's going to have 2 additional counter-order restaurants and then open seating for all three restaurants.  With respect to M'ole, the menu is not extensive, but they do a really solid job. I love the 3 for $10 lunch menu, which allows you to puck any three menu items, so you can mix and match tacos, sides and dessert, or all tacos, etc. The tacos are simple, but delicious.  I've had the carne asada and the chicken. My friends rave about the vegetarian, which is essentially a chile rellano in a tortilla. The salsas have just enough kick for me (a mild-medium spice person), without overwhelming the tacos themselves. I love that the street corn comes in a bowl and is already cut off of the cob so that you don't have to struggle with that in your work clothes.  The fried plantains  with vanilla ice cream are delicious, and the perfect way to end the meal. My understanding is that they're still in a "soft open" phase, so the staff seems pretty limited, but the food has come out quickly all three times I've been in. I really hope they succeed. The food is good and the lunch deal is hard to beat.
