WB8BmFMORvshjb7tBw0e0Q I had dinner at Azul last night.  The service was pretty good, not great.  The food was delicious, but not really Mexican food by any stretch.  Similar, but not very authentic.  The prices weren't bad except for the $7 shot of regular whiskey my girlfriend wanted to mix with tea and honey for her cold.

It's not bad, but not good enough to make me anxious to come back.
