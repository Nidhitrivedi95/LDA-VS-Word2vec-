Jd2NUZeVeyWi1tTNKXMt1Q Authentic New Mexican food right down to the Question! .... Red or Green,? ( chile... I am definitely a green fan and si senor does not disappoint) The homemade chips ( thin and warm when served with not 1 or 2 but 4 salsas green white brown, bean & red! The white is unique and tasty. Fully echo other  yelper' s comments about excellent service. My new favorite in Phoenix. Nice East valley location too! Better than los dos Molinos! Although not as hot
