u65uMUc88VMD7wI09BU1IQ My partner and I were very hungry after happy hour at St. Elisabeth's Pub so we headed north on Saint Denis. This was the first restaurant we saw and they had a poster advertising $6.95 fajitas on Wednesdays. It was a Wednesday. And we miss Tex-Mex desperately after moving to New England. So guess where we had dinner?

The place was packed and jamming Latin tunes. We snagged a table for two right by the front windows which made for great people-watching. They complementarily provided a small basket of chips and salsa. The basket was laughably small (well, everything IS bigger in Texas) and the salsa was....sweet...a little off...I think it had carrots. 

The margaritas were huge and flavorful, better than anything I've had in Boston. And my beef fajitas were pretty good. Also better than anything I've had in Boston. I suppose those are low standards. I would've loved it more if it came with rice (just lettuce, cheese, sour cream, salsa without carrots) and a little more guacamole. My partner had the spinach enchiladas which were probably the healthiest spinach enchiladas I've ever tasted. They had tons of spinach and not too much cheese. 

Overall, the place was loud and rowdy. Service attentive, but not hovering. And it's a chain.
