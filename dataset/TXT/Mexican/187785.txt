O2opXFPnTG-Pxa_u-3w66A My favorite Mexican restaurant in the University area; if there's some place better let me know. Instead of the ubiquitous chips & dip you can get a chorizo & bean soup that is light and flavorful; it doesn't fill you up like chips will. A good choice if you are watching what your weight, although if not you can get the chips with come with a queso dip, a thinned out guacamole and salsa.

Their pork carnita's are just divine; big chunks of perfectly cooked  pork,  nicely charred on the outside and tender and flaky on the inside.

They bring you a plate with three different salsa and  pickled onions. Sometimes you get what I think is a house pickled jalapeno - it is cut in strips and much firmer than the usual canned jalapenos you get elsewhere. You get a generous serving of radishes, which go with the meat in their house made tortilla's beautifully. Never seen that anywhere in Charlotte, although it is common in LA.

If you don't want to be overloaded with carbs you can order three taco's off the menu. They come in many varieties and are dressed simply with onions and cilantro. Add some of their grilled cactus and you can fill up for about the price of any of their other entries without the excess carbs.

Most of the time the service is pretty good, everyonce in a while you may get a waitress that is kind of slack, but I can overlook that for delicious and authentic food at great prices.
