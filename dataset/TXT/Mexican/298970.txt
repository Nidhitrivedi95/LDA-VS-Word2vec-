zjvnqTjBp56NhMp1GrlO5g I am so loving this place!  We came here for happy hour twice so far and have nothing but rave reviews.  We ordered mostly food and stuck to beer, but they have a lot of interesting cocktails to be had!  We tried the wedge salad (full of blue cheese yum!), the Notorious PIG (a meal in itself!), seared brussel sprouts (must have for you brussel lovers), spicy fried wings (good but not my favorite) and the fish and chips (a bit on the small side, but loved the fries).  My only warning is that almost all the food has some kick to it.  Would be nice to have some items that weren't blazin' ;-)  My $3 Blue Moon washed them down nicely though...so I can't complain much!  My fiance, who has a sweet tooth, loved the deep fried Oreos and those brussel sprouts!

The food isn't the only star at this place. The people who work here are gems all on their own!  Great, friendly and helpful service!  Gotta love a non-chain where people actually like their jobs :)  The decor is sexy, chic and so was the music.  The women's bathroom could have used a little love, but all in all, this place is at the top of my list!  I will definitely be bringing my out of towners for a real Vegas experience.
