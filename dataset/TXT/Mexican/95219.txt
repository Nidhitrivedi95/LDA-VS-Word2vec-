eDK7ns2bB8pmQCoZMy3Idg I would give this restaurant 0 stars if I could. I used to love going to this place since their pupusas are the closeted to my grandmothers that I could find, but yesterday when I put in an order for pick and went into go get it, as I was waiting for my food to be ready I killed a cockroaches with my shoe, after that I became paranoid and looked around only to see two more close to the kitchen entrance. I left without my order.
