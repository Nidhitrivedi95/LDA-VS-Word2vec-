IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA The Baja ceviche is really good and, in my opinion, has just the right amount of lemon juice, making both the fish and shrimp in there, perfect.

I ordered a side of beets, also great and abundant, perfectly complemented by spinach and cheese.

And finally, the strawberry tres leches had nice moisture and consistency, was not overly sweet and was perfectly dressed by the rosted merengue.

Everyone in there was really nice and attentive. I do recommend this place if you look for casual mexican style cuisine in Las Vegas.
