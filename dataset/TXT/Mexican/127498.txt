HWl2EbZhkhAkFgqt44yUkA Hostess was completely inept. We arrived during an off peak time and asked for an inside table. The hostess kept radioing for someone to take us to a table but they never responded. We told her we would be fine with the terrace if we could sit in the shade so she immediately takes us to one in the sun. Here's an important fact about towns with plenty of restaurants: YOU DONT HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THIS NONSENSE. Leave and avoid what I guarantee you will continue to go downhill. I have no idea if the food is good but they hire people who don't know sun from shade. We left.
