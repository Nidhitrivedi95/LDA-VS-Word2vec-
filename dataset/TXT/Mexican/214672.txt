QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA Listen, y'all! Nacho daddy is the truth! I definitely didn't expect to be so impressed with nachos and was sure other yelpers were  exaggerating. So, we started with an order of ceviche and it was comparable to my favorite Mexican market ceviche. The margarita was excellent with patron because with the bottom shelf tequila, I tasted too much sweet and sour. Finally, we got the Golden Knights filet mignon nachos. So bomb holy smokes, my mouth is watering right now.
