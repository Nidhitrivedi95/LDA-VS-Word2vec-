EBcugzKWrUKMo4JFEWBu2g the Worst experience ever we have, when we have been seated we mentioned to the waiter that we have someone birthday and she mentioned that she will get her people to say HBD but nothing happened and we did not ask again by the end because we were already frustrated with the very very poor service, we ordered a soup and entree and they got both of them on the same time with the soup cold and then the waiter asked us to take the entree and put it in the kitchen so it will not become cold and he said that he will bring later a new one and will be hot after we have our soup, we said to him be honest as u will take it back to the kitchen and they will bring it again after they heated it in the microwave, these guys have a lot of problems and very poor service don`t buzzer to go there just go to chilli's in USA and see the service these guys in USA are amazing, the manager came with a five dollars coupon by the end of this stay to say he is sorry for anything and that we can use this coupon on our next visit, he is dreamer we will never ever go back there and will never recommend to anybody.
