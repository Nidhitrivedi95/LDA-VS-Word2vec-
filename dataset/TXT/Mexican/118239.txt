Gq3OgSd5KflKuwNJmuWt7Q I'll keep it simple--this is the poorest excuse for a Mexican restaurant in which I have dined.  The place was empty when the courtyard was overfilled with people, and thus I had my suspicions upon walking in because of that.  The nachos hardly have any cheese on them.  They do not serve hard-shell tacos!! but soft shell only that they claim they can crisp up!  The portions of meat on the tacos were so scant, it was hard to believe they were tacos.  This place won't be in business for long, so this review will be moot.  But until they close, stay away.  There is another Mexican Restaurant within the same complex if you must have Mexican food.
