hia-4btswHjr2fiZlUBZLA Even after the "Del Taco Sauce Fiasco" involving an employee being filmed using expletives with customers over hot sauce packets, they still can't seem to get it together. At least the sauce anyway. 

I visited today (different location) and asked for lots of packets of the Del Scorcho sauce. When I got my food and opened it an hour later there were none. 

Two stars for decent fast food. Zero stars for the poor customer service.
