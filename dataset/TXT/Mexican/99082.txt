eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg Good service, a nice friendly/unique atmosphere, and excellent food, what more could one ask for from a Sunday afternoon brunch??? Not much. This past weekend, the family and I made the trek to downtown Phoenix to try Barrio Cafe and I'm sure glad we did. We arrived promptly when they opened to avoid the crowds, and even though we were so early, the service and food surely hit the mark. It took us a minute or two to actually find the place, but once we did, it's actually hard to miss. Loved the decor and wall art, couldn't have gone better with the food.

As for the food and drinks, everything was delish. We shared the "famous" guacamole, which was simple, fresh, and as everyone else on Yelp can attest to, very tasty. For lunch I had the pork tacos... the pork they are known for. It was simple as well, but everything was good... not amazing, but on point. For dessert we all shared the tres leches, which blew me away (though I only got a couple bites). 

This small hole in the wall place is serving up some unique, fresh, yummy food and drinks (BTW had a margarita and it was also very good), so you can bet we will venture to downtown again and pop into this spot.
