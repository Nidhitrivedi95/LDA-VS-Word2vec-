G7LYpILnHveyvbg3sJePPw I'd choose Cinko over this similar resto any day. Maybe I'm biased because I ate at Cinko first and fell in love but although the price point is the same ($5 for everything on the menu) the experience is a lot different.

Upon approaching the restaurant we already saw a lineup that didn't seem to be moving. It took us about 30 or more minutes to finally nab a seat. Once inside the service was incredibly slow but drinks came faster than our food. They had music videos playing loud for music and it was definitely a younger crowd. We both ordered quesadillas and the food was satisfactory. But we can't complain because of the price point. 

That being said I'd recommend Cinko on St Denis for a better experience.
