woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ This place seems to get packed easily. We didn't have a reservation, so it was a free-for-all for bar seats. The host was super cool and made room for us at a table that was between reservations. Definitely over the top in costumer service. Wait staff was also great!

We went for the Pittsburgh Winter Restaurant Week Deal (Chips, Guac, red or verde salsa; choice of 2 apps; and choice of 2 tacos). The salsa verde (tomatillo) was rich and smoky and I definitely recommend. Other apps (guac, papas bravas, and ceviche) were also delicious. For dinner, We chose the Korean Beef BBQ taco and the Al Pastor Taco. Korean taco was very good, but the Al Pastor was fantastic!! I definitely recommend getting that one for sure! For dessert they had 3 options, but one sounded the most unique and we got that one (because why not!?) It was a chocolate bread pudding, with espresso/chocolate sauce, brownie bits sprinkled on top, bananas foster, and house-made Mexican chocolate ice cream... That was all in one dessert!!!! It was big enough to split (but small/good enough to finish even after a huge meal).

I plan to go back and explore the other taco options, because they all looked amazing!
