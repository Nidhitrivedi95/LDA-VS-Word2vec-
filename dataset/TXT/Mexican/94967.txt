ec0CUK3Svfogdd2GUVVCqA After hearing the name change and seeing the other "okay" yelp reviews we figured to give this place a try. This is only getting one star because the salsa was decent and you can't give the review zero. The service is very slow and our waiter had no idea about the items on the menu. When he was specifically asked what each item was all he could say was I think and when the food came out it was all the wrong stuff nothing like he described. We ordered a side of queso cheese for our chips and it was so runny but I would not even stay on the chip. The food was not good at all there was supposed to be cheese on the item of food that I was given but it was so runny you would have no idea it was even there, there was green salsa as well but I don't know if that was on the plate or not. After about 3 bites into the food (which had no flavor what-so-ever) a baby millipede came crawling out of my pile of salad and onto my napkin. We had to go to the hostess for assistance because the waiter never came to check on us and there was no one else around, we asked her for the manager who again took forever so we had the hostess look at the bug before it ran off. Finally he came and acted like okay so what, then I believe it was the owners brother who came over to help us out. We never ate another bite and will not return this guy was a good help apologized, took care of our bill and gave us a 20% off discount for our next visit however won't be visiting again.
