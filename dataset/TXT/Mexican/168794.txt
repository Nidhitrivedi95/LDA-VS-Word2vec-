lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw If you thought Mercardito was bad -- this place is worse!  $100 for hubby and I to have dinner at a Mexican restaurant -- no meat in the chicken tamales (which were also weird SWEET corn mesa!) and the steak tacos were so salty that they were barely edible.  

With yummy, local Mexican food (at much more reasonable, less touristy prices!) within a few miles, I give this place 6 months, which sucks because the patio would be a wonderful place to hang out for locals and tourists alike!
