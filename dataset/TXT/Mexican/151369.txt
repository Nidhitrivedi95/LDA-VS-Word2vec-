JTD_PsAqE8f5qF6ssXwbkA My boss and I celebrate taco Tuesday every week. Our usual is Roberto's, but every once in a while we will do Tacos El Gordo. We decided to really switch things up a couple of weeks ago and try Don Tortaco. 
It's bigger than the Roberto's that we frequent, and cleaner! 
Don Tortaco has one thing that the other places don't, CARNITAS!!! 
We fell in love with their carnita tacos! 
My only complaints would be that the beans are not as smooth as others. The red salsa is burn your face off hot. 
And they need more locations!
