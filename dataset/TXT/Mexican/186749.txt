o-D37YVIe0-ravg2HBG8Jw I went looking for a nearby sandwich shop on Yelp.   The typical fare first popped up but then I zoomed in to the south side of Madison.  What's this?  La Concha?  Hmmmm,   Good reviews, different and interesting fare.  Perfect.  I will try it out.
Two stores are sort of connected to each other and I first walked into a Mexican Grocery.  Is this where I order my sandwich?  No that's in the door next door.
Santa Maria, La Nina, La Pinta, La Concha!  What a great place.   A busy Mexican bakery/cafe, beautiful bake goods filled the cases,  well staffed and friendly, a nice menu for my selection and customers coming and going and coming and going.  Who said there was a recession?   This place is buzzing and for good reason.  Everything looks scrumptious.
I ordered the Chicken Torta based upon yelp recommendations and was certainly not disappointed.  I had to wait a while for it but when it came it was gigante   Make two fists and yes, that big or bigger.  And the bread was fantastico.
I will point out that my torta was 11 dollars.  But half is about the size of a typical chichen sandwich for 6 or 7 dollars.  So buy one and split it with a friend.
I will be back for some bakery very soon.  So happy to find a place like this in little ol' Madison.
