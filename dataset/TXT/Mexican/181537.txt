nemcwBBzPuTbP9oKF9t_Jw Is there some district in Mexico who's cuisine lends itself not so much to jalapeño refried beans and mole, but to Heldmans mayonnaise? Kid you not, burritos, tacos, tortillas, you name it they slather it on everything here. If you are of a persuasion that has an affinity to Wonder white bread and mayo Mexican experience, I don't think you have anywhere else to go than here.
