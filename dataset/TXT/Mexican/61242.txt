as_fyujgsdwtV56n31z-Sw I must say that I was underwhelmed by this restaurant, which was a disappointment. I am willing to give it another chance, go back and try some different stuff on the menu. I got the street corn, which had a slight kick to it, but overall was really good. I also got 2 tacos and split some salsa with my boyfriend. The service was good, and the tacos were stuffed less than I would have liked. You definitely can get away with ordering 3-4, or 2 + a side. I would like to go back for a happy hour because I hear the drinks are good. The restaurant has a lot of potential, so I am eager to go back and see if it has changed any since I went.
