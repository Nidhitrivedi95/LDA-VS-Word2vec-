jDQIKfsfJU3M8M6n0ESKFg Don't understand why anyone would wait in their insane lines for bad service and horrible food. Waited 15 mins just to order and another 30 for the food to be ready. We had looked at the menu ahead of time online just to be told that we couldn't order the items listed online. When we got our food it was cold. My burrito was so poorly wrapped that you couldn't even pick it up. The only reason the carne asada had any flavor at all is because it had so much salt on it. I do not recommend this place.
