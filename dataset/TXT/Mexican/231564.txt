Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg I believe this is the same place that my family and I went to...it just looks different..but I heard they went under construction because of a fire...so let's pretend like it is:

I went to this restaurant because my family and I were visiting Las Vegas as we normally do during major holidays..Thanksgiving 2007 was no exception...however, this weekend was different because we vowed to stay off the strip and find "local" restaurants to try. After a search of the best Mexican restaurants in Vegas this was the first listing that caught our attention...mainly because it was voted by the people of Las Vegas...well that's what the local Vegas newspaper said...anyway lets move onto the review (caveat:  I'm a Mexican food lover trapped in a Filipino American girl's body...i LOVE Mexican food):

chips, salsa and bean dip = excellent.  If you have self control problems probably not a good idea to eat the freshly made chips and salsa because you won't stop even after your main dish has arrived..they're that delicious...

margaritas - there was not a single table (w/ the exception of ours) that did not have a margarita on the rocks..it's a family style restaurant and these families love their margaritas!

Carnitas (this is what I ordered...i don't even know what the rest of my family had I was distracted by the yumminess of my own food) -  Lean pork marinated with fresh oranges and spices. Slowly cooked in its own juices until tender. The state of Michoacan is known for the best carnitas in all Mexico. Served with chiles toreados, green sauce and guacamole. the meat fell right off the bone...

Overall, I would definitely recommend this place..unless, you're in a hurry to eat...this place was super busy (probably a testament to their food) so the wait was a little longer than usual.  Other than that this place is what Mexican food should be.
