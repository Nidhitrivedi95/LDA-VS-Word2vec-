CsS9WsonGYyE3vINi5bxSg Just came back from Barrio Coreano with high hopes of a Korean fusion experience. The ambiance, food and drink seemed far from Korean. Starting with the drinks. We had a 9oz glass of wine and a Kimchi sour. The glass of wine was clearly not 9oz, and the server shrugged it off when we mentioned this. Kimchi Jack Daniels sour was not bad however really needed kimchi. Tasted like a regular jack sour without eggwhites. 

For a newly opened reataurant I was expecting lively service however ours came across as quite cold and someone who didn't want to be there. 

All of our food came very quickly. The Baja fish taco was quite good. Really liked the onions and radish that they used.
I was excited for the octopus taco however it came cold and the shell was soggy. Wasnt freshly made for our table.
Korean beef taco didnt have any Korean flavourings to it. 
Calamari was cooked perfectly and really enjoyed the spices however the kimchi and korean pear served with it was missing a mark. The server had forgot about the order and only came after we reminded her.

Overal, the food was lacking a real Koreaness to it. Seemed to trendy for the neighbourhood of family owned shops. Lastly, the meal was quite pricy for what it was. $45 a person for 1 drink and a couple light fares. Left slightly hungry.
