wKA2y-F_fPcBDOkpzDB9eQ Authentic Mexican food 100. Try the shrimp juice margarita to die for. Ate a mocateje bowl with friends and had to agree it was the best. Everything is fresh and tasty, not tasteless. Highly recommend and not pricey. The restaurant is not big inside and the later you go you might wait a bit. The wait is worth the great food.
