Fkj8vJocYilePMZv2y54WA Make sure you check you order before you leave. Everytime (x4) I ask to add sourcream, which costs an extra $1.20 for a spoonful, it's never on it & they forget the guacamole too. Then I tell them no pico on the next order, they write no pico on the burrito and guess what.......there's pico. Simple things to ask for, so never going back.
