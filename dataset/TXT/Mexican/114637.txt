gGt00WW8sNY2Sop7jYa7Tw So after heading to our usual Cabo Fish Taco, which had 20 people outside waiting to get in, I suggested we head across town to Bakersfield. Now that doesn't sound like a drive but we live just outside Mineral Springs! We used the Valet Parking which was great since there is no designated parking.We walked in and were immediately greeted by the hostess, who was extremely courteous and definitely knows how to do her job. She took my cel number, so we could get a text when there was a table ready. Off to the bar area where we found two stools. A manager came over and brought us two menus and said a server would be over in case we wanted any drinks or apps. He showed up immediately and we ordered a Corona, Spicy Jalapeño Margarita and Queso with Jalapeños. In a blink of the eye our Queso appeared...steamy hot with lightly salted Tortilla Chips. A few minutes later.. drinks! I ordered my Margarita with no salt but it came rimmed. I called our waiter over and he apologized. I said please tell the bartender not to pour it into another glass but make a fresh one. I watched and the bartender did it without pitching a fit....which lots of bartenders do. We got our text and were taken to our table by both our original and new waiters. She asked and we ordered a PAPAS TOSTADA. This was excellent...there were do many layers of flavors to this.   I had the Fish Taco and my wife had a Pollo Rojo....both were full of flavor and cooked just right. The service was great and the meal well paced. The only issue was our waitress, in addition to our table and the ones around it, had one on the other side of the restaurant. When it came time to get our check she was nowhere in site although her hair is multicolored, but appeared shortly. We'll definitely be back and recommend Bakersfield to everyone. The one funny part of the evening is we realized we were the oldest people there
