RZjCS8U_UuZaAmo5YawkOg This place is clean and the wait staff very pleasant.  The food is tame and geared towards east coast transplants, any Phoenix native can point you to more authentic Mexican, or Arizona-style Mexican restaurant for those of you that are looking for something that represents Southwestern taste a little better.  Great place to take your picky Grandfather from Minnesota, bad place to take your cousin from Guadalajara.
