HTlsBAd9j1wlWDHxnYczBw This is our favorite "authentic" Mexican food!

I've  been going to La Fonda (original location on Scottsdale Road/Curry) for over 45+ years

The food is wonderful! I love the green corn tamales! My husband loves the MaryLou. My grown kids like  chicken enchiladas with green sauce!

And all of us LOVE the fresh, hot chips and fabulous salsa!
