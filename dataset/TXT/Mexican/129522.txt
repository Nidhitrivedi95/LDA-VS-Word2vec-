i4QxkI-oZgFLD_dShF4F7g I've been coming here for years. The service is a little slow, but friendly and very helpful.

They have delicious Mexican, with three levels of spicy. I like their quesadillas, giant shrimp burrito, guacamole. 

The restaurant inside is about 5-6 tables only, with a beautiful patio that has about double the seating. 

Not too pricey, either.
