1JOQhzsW6cu4yVHuPhlRwQ The food and service used to be good. Waiter forgot the drinks, and then forgot to put in our food order. When we finally got the food, the orders were completely wrong. Dirty dishes were never picked up of the table, and we had to go to the bar to get silverware. To top things off, they didn't comp anything on the bill. Don't see us going back any time soon.
