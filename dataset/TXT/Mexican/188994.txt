OA5Li3ySzhrbG_WvD_QGYA I'm always looking for a reason to go to Barrio. This is one of my favorite places in Cleveland!!  I love the create your own tacos as well as their suggestions. The tofu bits are delicious and their pumpkin guacamole is the strangest yet most delicious dip ever. I love how vegetarian friendly this place is.  They have tasty strong margaritas as well.  The inside can get a little loud, but the patio is so enjoyable during the summer time.  I even had my birthday dinner here.  This is the place to go if you're looking for a reasonably priced foodie taco experience.
