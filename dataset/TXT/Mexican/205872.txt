pyeoyouJWxxcwzfugfessQ I've been here a couple times now and am willing to give them a couple more shots. 

The first time I came, we sat on the patio which was great! We each ordered one of the specialty drinks, which were delicious....but a bit pricey. We started with the "Liquid Gold" queso, which my friends had tried the last time they were there and said it was awesome. However, when it came out, it was soupy and flavorless. None of us are the type of people to send food back, but it was that bad. They didn't charge us for it, but they also didn't send a manager out to talk to us which was strange. For dinner, I ordered the diablo shrimp, carnitas and chicken tinga tacos. All were delicious and filling. I don't remember what my friends ordered, but they had ordered something similar the last time they were there and said it tasted completely different this time.

Last week when I came, I ordered tacos again....The carne asada, al pastor and diablo shrimp. All were good, but the diablo shrimp was much spicier than last time. My dad ordered the diablo shrimp torta with street corn. He said it was good, but nothing to write home about. 

Overall, this place is new and is probably still working out the kinks. Happy that there is a Mexican restaurant that is not a chain nearby finally!
