jZwqcK3UF3Aa8nxrh9BHig I'll keep this brief. We have been coming to Las Cazuelas regularly for 5 years now, desperately sweating out their run-in with ICE a few years back, and rejoicing openly when they reopened. The food is consistently delicious, the staff is friendly and welcoming, and the prices are unbeatable. This is the real deal! Caz has the best Mexican this side of San Diego. My only minor complaint is sometimes inattentive service after the food arrives. It's our home away from home.
