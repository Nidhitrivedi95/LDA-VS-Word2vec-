NSgSagwajv26iS8zUKs2EQ Man I love this place. They have the BEST virgin margaritas I have ever had. NOWHERE seems to know how to get something that is so simple correct. I am so glad I live far from it. Otherwise I'd be like Norm from Cheers,  'Everyone knows my name."
It does get hectic and can be a zoo. But I'll wait to get a sip of these delights. Makes my mouth happy! 

Oh and the food is great too. I love the chicken quesadillas and a friend said the new mexican tacos were delish too.
