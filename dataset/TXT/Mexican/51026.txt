93cSBol4_mnfzxIfG9RCDA Visited here for the first time on Thursday and I already can't wait to go back! I normally go to Fruitlicious on 35th & Southern but after they were closed during open hours, I decided that was the last straw so I tried Sweet Bites. Boy, am I happy I did! I bought 2 elote cups for my mother and I, and they were delicious! The decor inside is super upscale, and the girl who helped me was extremely friendly! The prices are also comparable to Fruitlicious, yet the customer service and professionalism is so much better. PLEASE support this local establishment! Will be back soon for another Sweet Bite!
