SW6ZQk22G1_CV81_gfnvNQ I was fortunate to go here over the past weekend and for the first time there was no line up. I absolute love this place. The tacos are great and the service is great and fast. If there is no line up, one could actually come here for a quick lunch during the weekdays. It takes approximately 3 tacos to fill the average person from my experiences.

My suggestions are to try the ceviche and chorizo tacos.

The only aspect I would change is to lower the volume of the music to allow patrons to talk normally instead of yelling.
