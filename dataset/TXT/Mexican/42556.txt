75vRgse6O3P4GL_vi3Xr9Q Pro: Food is great and cheap! 
Cons: Cash Only, No Parking, Always Busy! 
Would I go again: Yeh... 

I got the carne asada tacos ($1) and my friend super nachos ($8) ... plus a mini quesadilla for my baby niece ($2) Overall, the food was great! Good flavors and very affordable!! Buuuut, I almost ran over a line of people waiting to get tacos -_- there is no parking and it's a tight space.
