B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA When I need a quick fix, don't have time or room for all you can eat I come here!!!! I always get the 3 amigos burrito which seems to give the most sashimi and taste amazing! Taro chips and cheese were surprisingly delicious as well!! Aloe vera drinks ++++ lots of good sauces and lime for free~
