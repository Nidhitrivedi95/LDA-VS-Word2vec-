bE2pOsHjCM8048ILoRVxNw I love Mexican, and I've had Pasqual's chips before (thank you Hy-Vee), so I was excited to actually check this place out.  

First 'pro' was the interior. I loved the large wood beams going across the ceiling and the minimal decor.

We started with chips and guac.  GREAT guacamole. And of course, the chips were crisp and seasoned well. I ordered a single enchilada with a side of sour cream. The food came out in a reasonable time, but I did not have my sour cream.  I asked again for the side of sour cream, and the waitress came back with sour cream and guacamole.  I did not order or need more guac, so I set it aside.
The food was good and I enjoyed all of it.  After eating, my friend and I waited. And waited. And waited. Nobody stopped by to check on us, clear the plates, and see if we wanted the check. It was after lunch rush hour, and was not very busy in the restaurant.  We waited probably around 10-15 minutes before anyone stopped by the table.  When we got the check, there was a side order of guac on the check.  I put money in the checkbook, but kept it close, so I could point out the small discrepancy. Again though, we had to wait.  Another 5-10 minutes before the waitress came to take the checkbook. She was fine with removing the guac from the bill, as I had not ordered or used it. The change came back quick. 

Overall, the food was great, but the service was poor.  I'd like to go back and hopefully have a better service experience and try some of the tequila based drinks!
