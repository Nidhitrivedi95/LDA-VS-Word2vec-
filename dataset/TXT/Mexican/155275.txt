k6EQholZjA03b-O6foAPCA Typical run of the mill Mexican restaurant in Monroeville. Everyone in the group I was in enjoyed their meal- I got the taco salad and it tasted great. Other Mexican places I've been to have been willing to substitute the chicken in the taco salad for extra veggies or beans, however our waiter didn't allow me to do this. Further, we had a 10% coupon on my phone to use for our meal, and the waiter said they only accepted coupons printed out and in person (the coupon didn't even have a barcode)! Come on guys, it's 2014.
