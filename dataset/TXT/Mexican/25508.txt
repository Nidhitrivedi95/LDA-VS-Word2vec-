333W59XcrXZsJlnBAAx5mQ As a family who has visited this establishment more than once, I am very disappointed in the service I received recently and I will likely not be back. I was excited when this restaurant opened in my neighborhood ~ they took quite some time to offer "to go" food. I can appreciate  getting your bearings, but as a pregnant woman on strict bed rest who was craving Mexican food, it was disappointing that they were not able to serve us.

Their food is decent ~ tex~ mex only, if that's what you're in to. We don't go often but tonight after screwing up an at home dinner we thought we'd go. Now at home with twins, we also don't go out often but order to go food frequently.

When we ordered two meals and a kids quesadilla, we were told that they do not offer kids's meals to go.....because they do not have containers for kid's size meals. WHAT??? You can't offer me a kids quesadilla to go because the container is not the right size?

When pushed they said "no" because they just don't offer kids meals to go. So regular meals to go are finally ok, but no kids. If you offer it on your website, why don't you offer it to go? The manager, Terri, said that when the owner tells her something, she just does it, no questions asked.  So she couldn't even give me a a logical reason for not making me this kids meal.

With only decent food and ridiculous "rules" of business that you can't justify or explain, I will happily take my family's business, kids included, elsewhere.
