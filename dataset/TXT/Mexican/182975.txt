nL1FdcNZ6liuQ1odNNWVNQ The bar/cantina section has been closed either three months, or a year, depending on which employee was closer to the truth.  I went to the company web site the day that I decided to try Top Shelf, and there were specials listed for the cantina in the Mesa location, and promises of high definition TV's and whatever sports one might want to watch.

The company website is not accurate, and I made a trip there for nothing based on this false and stale information.
