Wcw-xq_c89e4AaRsUtkaLw The only place I know where I can get a seat for a weekend brunch without waiting. Normally, that would be a bad thing, but I think people just haven't discovered this place in the morning yet. Lots of windows and a Southern exposure make this place a bright way to start your morning.

They've got eggs and pancakes with a slight Southwestern twist. The brunch is much more reasonably priced than the dinners. And the staff are actually friendly first thing in the morning.
