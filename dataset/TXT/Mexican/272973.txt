wwgH65yjLssksjz8ASU3QA Great food, very fresh, fast line during lunch time rush. Employees shouldn't forget that some people haven't been there before or haven't been there for awhile so ordering doesn't come natural, help us out. Maybe you could say "Have you been here before?" and if not explain a few things, or otherwise if they say the have been there say "Welcome back!" ...just a thought  :) Great, quick, satisfying meal. I ordered the bowl with brown rice, steak, pico de gallo, cheese, guacamole, black beans - fresh iced tea YUM
