I'm from Los Angeles. City of angels, and street taco vendors. 
So I hear about this place in Phoenix from a guy  in the bar-stool-next to me types and I take note.
Place called "speedy street tacos" that's open whenever you're hungry. Right by the airport. 

Ok. So I go for it.

I take a look at the menu. It's sparse. But sparse in a good way. Like you know that whatever you order is going to be made of good stuff.

I get a mix of chicken/steak tacos, a steak burrito, and a quesadilla. ... Then I start my timer. How speedy is speedy? 4:16. That's pretty quick for 5 items.
So yeah they're fast.
But how "street" are they? 
Do they meet the "mom and pop place in the East LA barrio" good? 
Or the "late night taco truck at the closed car wash" good. 
Could be. But with the fresh corn tortillas, tender and flavorful meat, pickled red onion relish and picante salsas, and OMG RED ONION RELISH, 
This place toes the line with the speedy service and street-cred of "little old lady with the taco cart that has the line wrapping around the corner" good.

Will I be back? Oh yeah. I'm calling this place a red-hot 5 stars worthy to be your first stop in Phoenix right after you grab your bags at the airport.
