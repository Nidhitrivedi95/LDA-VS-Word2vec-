jv1sbEWUJRHeUff1xZtqWg We ate here two days in a row because I could not believe that this establishment was actually this clean and the staff were this nice. I was totally wrong. The same young man who took my order the night before was here again while on my way home. Still nice as can be and was constantly busy from behind the counter when there were no orders to be taken. The establishment was clean and even smelled clean.
