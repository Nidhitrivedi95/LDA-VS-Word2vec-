qnn9E-e9orYf_wK37yLTYw The restaurant is part of a group of restaurants that is turning very chain-restaurant. The restaurant is very clean and the food will come within 2 hours which is the free parking limit. I ordered the green chili pork enchiladas with black beans and rice. The presentation was interesting as the enchilada came in a skillet but the food was just average. No real flavor on either the beans or the meat. The saving grace was that the enchilada sauce compensated for lack of flavor. The prices are on the higher end.

I do not feel the need to return as I can get a better value for a better price elsewhere.
