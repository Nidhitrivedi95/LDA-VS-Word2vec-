ms7cmWkPiSBDTnz-1sv2kQ Ticoz was unexpected. Nothing is better than walking into a restaurant with the sense of the unknown lingering all around you. My wife and I arrived at Ticoz ready to celebrate. The atmosphere was lively yet pleasent for a Friday night, you didn't get the sense they were busy, even though the parking lot and valet were full. I do recommend making reservations in advance, just to avoid any wait. The bar and seating area are seperated nicely, and the restaurant as a whole is well organized. 

Bring on the food!!! We started with the fried calimari and chips with salsa. The calimari was standard, nothing really to write home about. However, the chips and salsa were great. The salsa starts very fresh and mild, but slowly opens up with greater hints of heat. Then came the main course. Green Chili Enchilada's with a fried egg on top...could be one of the best dishes I've ever had!! If you visit Ticoz for nothing else than this dish, you will not be disappointed. To accomodate the enchilada's was a great fresh Sangria that changes with each refill, the sign of a great Sangria. 

Ticoz is very affordable, has great food, and good customer service. Go for one dish, go for more, but primarily...GO. 

Ch..ch...ch....check it out!!!
