fXUJ9d5R6kNXrnAouByB6g We were there this weekend and were pretty dissapointed. We love their food and have been loyal customers for many many years. I always ask them to put cheese in my burrito and they always charge me like $1.75 or something like that. Paying is not the problem since I always get cheese in my burrito and therefore I already expect it. I mentioned to the cashier the last time I was there they charged me for cheese and they did not add it to my burrito and that maybe she should waive the charge this time to make up for that time. I know its just $1.75 and not a big deal, but it was to them! The cashier called another cashier and she said that I should have complained then and told the cashier to make sure and charge me for the cheese and she walked away. Can you say RUDEEE!!! I payed for my darn cheese that I did not recieve last time. So I wasnt going to sit there and argue with her over a darn dollar. We ate and left and we are never coming back. $1.75 is not the problem, their attitude is the problem. Im a paying customer and if youre going to charge me at the very least treat me with respect.
