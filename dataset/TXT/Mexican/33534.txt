4tiFtmGNFcvKRSPXPVT8Hw I'll describe Mercadito as Mexican food for yuppies who think they're eating authentic Mexican. Yes, the food is pretty good, the decor is nice, the service alright. Maybe I"m just a cheap skate, BUT it's really hard to enjoy a cuisine that's not meant to be expensive. $12 for 3 tacos is a bit steep and a scoop of guacamole is $4.50 (it's not even table side) . I get it's a restaurant in a casino, but I'm just not the type of person to fuss over a high end Mexican restaurant. I'd rather enjoy my Mexican food standing next to the food truck.
