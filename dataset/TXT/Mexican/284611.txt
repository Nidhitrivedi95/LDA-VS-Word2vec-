xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw The fry bread is good, but it is overpriced and the service is Horrible!  The fact that they gave a Giant Tip jar is hilarious, since they just take your money and call out your name when it's ready.   I guess you're tipping for the indifferent service that is border line rude and obnoxious.  Won't be going back.
