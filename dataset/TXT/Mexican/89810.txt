DugcfgyM4DhDldK_jsF0Xw Terrible!!!  After standing in line for nearly 15mins just to order, they kept messing up my order.  The three people that ordered after me ended up getting their orders when they haven't even started on mine yet.  I was there for over 25 mins before they even considered to get started on my order.  I ended up cancelling my order in fear that I would be late for work.   Another customer ended up asking me if the service is normally this bad...  I told him I had no idea,  that it was also my first time at this location.  I ended up eating nothing on on my lunch break so I could make it back to work.
