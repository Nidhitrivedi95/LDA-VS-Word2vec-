c5TOGBUCCUUNBPM7h_KbmQ Came here because chile verde had a ridiculous wait. I had carne asada fries which was super bland. The carrots and even the salsa had no flavor! Everything is pre-made and they just heat it up. My fries were ready literally a minute after I ordered. My friend had tacos and the tortillas were cold and stale. Totally did not satisfy our Mexican craving. Do yourself a favor and just go to don tortaco or robertos....even better go to chile verde! The cucumbers were good! The staff was very nice also!
