9KeJfn7-6DFfUFoZLu_DNQ Great vibe, great service and the flavours were amazing. The top pick are the Baja tacos. So good. The shredded beets on the top were a concern but I dove in and was not disappointed. The combination was outstanding. Next up was the steak taco. Oh wow! I have never tasted such an amazing combo of steak, sesame, Korean hot sauce in one scrumptious bite. What a flavour sensation. 
The four stars are due to the beverage.  The margarita was a slight disappointment for it should have been presented without the rocks as a shaken margarita should, the flavour wasn't bad and they did not short you on the tequila for it was present when you took your first sip. 
Our server was super pleasant. Gave us good recommendations and was prompt, courteous and helpful. I'll definitely go back.
