wKA2y-F_fPcBDOkpzDB9eQ Came here after NASCAR for dinner with a group of 4. The restaurant is cozy and very well decorated with pictures of Zapata and the history that comes with that. The service was great, they give you chips beans and salsa while you wait. The sopa de Fideo reminds me of moms cooking. The waiter is nice and told us that they have a full bar but no drink menu. We ordered the mango margaritas. I appreciate the salt on the rim but they skipped the salt I guess. I ordered the chile colorado. It was impressive. We also ordered fried ice cream and it was devious. The place is very busy as it is popular. I also liked the dress of the workers and also the tortilla lady making fresh tortillas! Would love to return here but it's a bit far from my area.
