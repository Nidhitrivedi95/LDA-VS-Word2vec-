2anxB5OiLo_-eFh_o2j-rw Normally I don't review fast food restaurants, but I just felt I had to because of the one star review. 

I've been to at least 5 different Chipotle locations and this one is just as good as the others. I've never had a problem with the staff. They're polite enough...you only encounter each person for a maximum of thirty seconds, what exactly are you looking for?? They are quick too, even with a long line it moves quickly, actually a lot more quickly than other locations I've been to. I give this location an A.
