19npP5v_AhGvN7Cjd3UcqQ We had been to this location prior to it becoming Salsita's with negative outcomes. Our experience tonight was excellent!!! We ate on a Friday around 5 pm. We were so impressed! Clean, neat atmosphere. Polite service, other than waiting to get our check. 
We had our two young kids with us and when they said it was delicious I knew we were on the right track! The restrooms were very clean! ( extra important when you have kids!) Our meals came out quickly, and I will be recommending this place to anyone with kids! Every parent knows one of the nightmares of eating out with kids is the wait time between sitting down and feeding your face...which seems to drag on when you have starving kids who won't sit still. This was absolutely not the case tonight! 
My husband had the enchilada sampler and said every type was delicious. I had the chicken enchiladas and I was very happy with how great the quality of the chicken was! My kids had cheese quesadilla and tacos with beans and rice. We all enjoyed everything. The salsa is perfect too, for me at least. Good flavor without spice. I'm sure they have spicier options but I didn't look. 
Also we didn't interact with him much but the manager was around and was so genuinely nice. He looks like Fred Armisen. Go see for yourself!
