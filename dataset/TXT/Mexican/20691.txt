Took 1.5 hours to get fajitas and nachos
Never asked if we wanted another drink (never came in 1.5 hours at all- we called them to ask where the food was). 
We had a show to get to and had only like 8 min to eat the food, which was decent. 
Good flavor but soggy tortilla chips for the nachos- I mean come on! 
So won't recommend this place.
