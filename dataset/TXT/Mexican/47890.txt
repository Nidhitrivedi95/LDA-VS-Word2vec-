85C2ZqiCc1_qeq2vTj_Saw I haven't figure out what kind of Mexican restaurant it is. The food flavor is so so. Nothing to be thrill about. I had better Mexican food than this place. The decoration is really nice. 

When I want to eat in a Mexican restaurant, I like to taste the authenticity of the regional food. Otherwise, I can go to Taco Bell for a so-called Mexican food.
