Cd2ERofxOeCbCi-0yDs0aw Just love to try little local places like this.  We ordered two of the frybread tacos with the green chili sauce.  It was very, very good.  a couple of orange sodas to go with it.  Just what was needed after multiple hotel meals and conference buffets.

The place is not big.  few tables in the front and a few in the back.  We sat outside, and it was a wonderful evening.

Highly recommend this place.  Nice friendly people and a great local food.
