2j78b8m1w4Sr2GVGCzFBtQ Yeah, this is not good food.. guacamole was more like pico de gallo with a scent of avocado. Tacos were okay but not really tasty, and the salsas were "meh".

Staff was friendly and decor was nice and that's why they get thr two stars.

Uptown needs a real quality mexican restaurante.
