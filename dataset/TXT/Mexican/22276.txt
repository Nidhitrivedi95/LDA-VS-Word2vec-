I ordered hot sauce but it wasn't really spicy. Shortly later ordered few beers and shots. I got 3 tacos and she got enchiladas. Both were good but too much to eat it all. I got so full that I couldn't order more beer. 

When we first got in, we were sat in odd corner between two big families and waiter was cool enough to clean another table so we could get more privacy.
