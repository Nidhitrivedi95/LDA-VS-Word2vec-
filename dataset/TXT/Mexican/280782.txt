XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Had the roasted garlic tiger prawn tamale and the spicy chicken sweet potato hash. Simply amazing!! Both dishes were perfectly balanced with incredible flavors. The tamale had a hint of sweet that paired well with the shrimp and cilantro cream sauce. The chicken and sweet potato hash had the perfect amount of spice - not too over the top, but left a nice heat on the back of the palate. Also our server, Santiago, was excellent as well. Very knowledgeable about the menu and made excellent recommendations. Highly recommend!
