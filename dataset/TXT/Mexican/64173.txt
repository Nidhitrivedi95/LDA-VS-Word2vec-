B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA Love it!!!! Ordered steak and egg burrito and it is delicious =) very accurate on your order and fast. Staffs are friendly and courteous. They have great selections on what to make for your burrito and the way I see it, anything you put in there will be perfect. Definitely a place to visit when in town.
