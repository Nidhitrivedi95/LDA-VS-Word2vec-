uQdk6xm0TE4qji48yysRDA First time, and not my last. Food was all good. Everything freshly made. We started off with Natchos...... Delicious! We each ordered something different. I had the Fish Tacos which came with two sides, bean corn soup and Mexican fried rice. Staff very nice! The music had me moving on my seat. 
Great experience.
