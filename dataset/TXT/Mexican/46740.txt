The space is small, and it caters mostly to folks who work in the area. The food is fresh, and the staff is extremely friendly and focused on ensuring you have an awesome meal.

I had the carnitas Jalisco, which is a pork based dish. It was what I would expect out of a home kitchen! Must go if you're in the area.
