YNUdy-W_ZFO9B2SZUKRrPw Love me some Del Taco! And this location is my fave! Yes, close to home, but it's more than just convenient. My food is ALWAYS fresh and warm, and my tacos are always full. As a semi-regular customer, that makes all the difference! And it'll keep me coming back for all my late-night drive-thru needs!!
