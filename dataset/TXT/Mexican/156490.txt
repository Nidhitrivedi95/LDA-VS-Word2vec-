keJOgdHUWFm2d08qFk3QsA If you want AUTHENTIC Mexican food this is the place! Great food that is always spiced just right, juicy meat, nothing is dryed out or old looking, very fresh and yummy! I love the Patron Sampler and get it for my entre,  great service every time we go! This is the real deal. We love the hand carved chairs, tables and booths! So friendly and always smiling!
