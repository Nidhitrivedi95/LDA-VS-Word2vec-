MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA Went for a Sunday lunch and Grand Electric was busy, but we were still able to get a table for two without a wait. The atmosphere was fun and very casual. Definitely a place I'd go with friends but I don't think my parents would appreciate it as much. 

We really enjoyed the super fresh salsa, guac and chips while we mulled over which tacos to try. We each got three mini tacos and by far my favourite was the fish taco! I would love to back and eat many many more of them! The fish was battered: crispy but not greasy. There was a creamy but citrus-ee dressing and it was topped with a satisfying crunchy shredded slaw (can't remember what it was). I also loved that they were soft tacos (not a fan of hard shell tacos).
