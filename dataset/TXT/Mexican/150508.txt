Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ I was treated really unfair at this place. The waitress recommended a non alcoholic drink to my 2 friends, they both ordered it. When I was presented the check, those drinks were $13 each. I was stunted. How can be a non alcoholic drink so expensive. I complain and demand not to pay for it. They said the price includes the glass, but we were not warned or told. I said I will pay for the drink but not the glass, they will call the police if I don't pay for the glass. And recommend me to read the menu before ordering. What ahole. Ok I paid the tab but no tip. If they just more friendly not to charge me for the glass, I will easily pay them $25 in tip. Dumb people. By the way, the food is not worth anyone's time to go. Overall , avoid it if you can.
