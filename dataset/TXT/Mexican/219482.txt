REJPrXEZly4PDQNmiMGI8Q Unfortunately I have to write a bad review,  I have raved about the French fries here and have hooked a lot of people on their fries. I had hoped it was just a fluke that I was getting undercooked fries, but 4 times in a row isn't a fluke. I use to come on every Tuesday for these fries, but I can't continue to be disappointed and eat soggy undercooked fries. I think this will be my last time getting fries here. It's a sad day.
