_eYGcch95eygN_b_rigUkg I love going to Cardenas, but I hate the huge lines and the amount of time it takes to get out of that place . For example where the fresh fruit, raspados the ladies are super slow.  They act like we are trying to get something for free ... But first they literally take 5 minutes to finish talking even if they see you standing waiting for service . Then once they get to helping you , they stop occasionally because one of their coworker -friend has something personal to say . To make matters worst they don't say "thank you " "have a good day " instead they hang you receipt and let it hit the counter when they clearly see your hand trying to get it . I took 20 minutes with no line to get 2 raspados. Flies flying everywhere with kids open like "hey it's not a big deal , it gives it flavor " no! As a business person this time of employees make the business gain diminish . Of course I have the same to say in regards to the cashiers . Same lack of guest service . The only time I had good service was at the cooked food section .
--forgot to mention when I ask lady what flavor a they had , she says " flavored are over there " as if each container had its name . I then said "can you tell me ?" VERY UNPROFESSIONAL !
