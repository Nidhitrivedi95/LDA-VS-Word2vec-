ymyEH_7lZV1ytVsSUGcsag Living in Painesville we're lucky to have our choice of good Mexican restaurants. Our favorite is Compadres. Although I have to agree with other reviews that the margaritas aren't the best. But that's where the negatives end. Service good, selection good, food very good. We are always getting coupons in the mail too, which is nice. I usually get our order to go and it is always hot and ready when they say it will be. I usually get the molcajete which is basically every ingredient they have well seasoned in a volcanic bowl. Last night I got the Puerto Vallarta burrito which was like a miniature version of it. My wife got the Pollo con Espinaca, which she liked. We also got the queso and chips and they give you plenty of salsa too. We'll be back, for sure. If you read my previous review of Moe's, Compadres is everything Moe's isn't. But if you want to throw your money away and go to Moe's you obviously have so sense of decency or taste, jk.
