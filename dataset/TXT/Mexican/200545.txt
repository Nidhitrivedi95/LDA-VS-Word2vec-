pEH8XwiyGOe1t7GlboAgGw This seems to be a very trendy restaurant in the heart of the entertainment district. I saw the trend but I didn't get it. There were several issues with this meal from my perspective......

The food itself was very tasty but just not to MY taste. Lots of flavour profiles that didn't suite MY palette. It was served very elegantly but that's were it ended for me. The chef clearly works hard at delivering a quality meal but it's lost with the poor service quality.

Our first server was stone faced & completely lacked a sense of humour. He dropped our table & we were happy he did! Our other servers were a little bit better. The female server was delightful but made several mistakes. She combined 2 different types of wine into a guests glass, we were served cold cappuccino's, they made a mess of the table with wine drips & in general the we felt like we were more of a bother then a valued cash paying guest. 

In all fairness they DID try & make up for the missteps by comping a portion of a bottle of wine & a no charge dessert!! 

All in all this was a less then enjoyable experience for me.
