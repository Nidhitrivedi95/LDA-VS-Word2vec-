Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ The atmosphere is very sleek -- I loved the hanging rope decorations overheard. Walking in felt like entering a cool party.

The margarita de jalapeno was incredible, as was the margarita de pepino. They were perfectly on-point drinks that satisfied the tastes (in these cases the jalepeno and the cucumber) that prompted me to try them.

The enchilada pueblo was good but it didn't change my life. Still whenever I am back in Vegas, I will definitely revisit Javier's.
