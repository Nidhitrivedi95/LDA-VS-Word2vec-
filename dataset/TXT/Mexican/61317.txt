as_fyujgsdwtV56n31z-Sw Went on a packed day long 45 minute wait!  It was a ok experience I still prefer the paladar over this place food seemed rushed and not as tasty as paladar, my mango rice wasn't nothing to brag about and tacos were just ok , all in all ok experience can't go wrong with the guacamole
