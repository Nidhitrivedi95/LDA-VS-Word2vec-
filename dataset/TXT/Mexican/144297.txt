This place has everything you need for a great date.

Quaint and romantic old house setting and patios.
Table cloths and faux candles
Menu full of artfully presented items
Wines by the glass or bottle
Background music in lieu of background noise.

We started our meal with a gargonzola salad, which they did a split plating for us. $6 The greens were fresh the cheese was bountiful and pungent the walnuts were candied and the slices of apple were crisp, what more could you want from a salad?

For our main dishes we had the Cherve Rellnos $12, Two large pablano chilies stuffed with well dices zucchini other veggies and goat cheese on top of a generous pile of polenta and a roasted red pepper sauce, it was amazing.

The other main was miso glazed salmon with sauted spinach and basmati rice. The fish had a nice crisp crust, the spinach had a nice flavor and the rice was well just rice, it could use a veggie in it to to spice it up.

Bottles of wine start at a affordable $12

The meal included bread with olive oil.

Bottom line great romantic place for dinner or lunch.
