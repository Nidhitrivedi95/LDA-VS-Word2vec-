BWmex2gxmeWWFwb6hjKm5Q I visit various Qdoba locations frequently, including this one. This is not the best. The service is quick and friendly, but the portions are awfully small. I usually go with the burrito bowl and am accustom to having a pretty full bowl, but this location has been light-handed on every occasion. I have started going to other locations or Chipotle, where I never leave hungry.
