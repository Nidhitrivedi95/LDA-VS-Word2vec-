e13SEvJud_vgeDR_doL4sQ Best margarita on the planet by far!! They have an amazing group of people who work there who care about the service they provide to their guests. The carnitas enchiladas with green sauce is amazing, and I can't refuse the guacamole! There are 3 different choices, I've never been offered that at a Mexican restaurant! I recommend this place all day, everyday!
