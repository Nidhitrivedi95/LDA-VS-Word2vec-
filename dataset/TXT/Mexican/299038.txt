zjvnqTjBp56NhMp1GrlO5g Great food a lot of stuff I never heard of, and food I didn't expect from a bar.

The decor is nice, very Lady Gaga-ish. I think the tables and chairs look cheap. The chairs are see-through plastic. The tables are narrow and have the edges are SHARP. I bumped my leg sliding into the booth and I had a nice bloody cut and now a bruise. 

But anyway...

We came for lunch during the work week. All the house lights were up and there were four other people having lunch, plus the owner at the bar. 

I loved the sassy menu names and hashtags. If I wasn't working I would've had a cocktail but instead had the opened faced egg sandwich. Dining partners had fried rice and tomato soup + grilled cheese. The grilled cheese was more like bruchetta than grilled cheese. But everything was still really good. Can't wait to come back and try some other menu items.

I'm not giving five stars because of the narrow tables, plastic chairs, awkward leather booths, the cut on my leg, and our waitress (who was very nice) spending to much talk to her friends about this one time at band camp instead of bringing us our check so we could go back to work.
