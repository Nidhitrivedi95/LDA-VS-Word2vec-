q50PTYB15EO2jEwgv-9vrA A few months back my wife and I spotted Si Senor on Broadview and we just knew we would eventually make our way into the restaurant. It's advertised as authentic Mexican cuisine and I won't disagree with them. Upon entering the atmosphere seemed authentic. Mexican music, proper lighting older looking tables. But enough about that, we were greeted and seated. Immediately upon being seated we were brought chips and salsa which were pretty good. The best thing is that they have a common kids menu with both Mexican and classic dishes just in case you have a picky eater (as we do)

Their menu is pretty large. Fajitas, tacos, enchiladas. All of the classic Mexican dishes. I ordered tacos de asada, my wife ordered steak and shrimp fajitas. From ordering to being served the service was fast and friendly, the food arrived hot, and the flavors? Aw man their refried beans are delicious. My youngest even enjoyed his enchilada. The best thing about Si Senor is I believe they're family owned. It feels family owned from their friendly service to the flavors of their food. If anyone drives by si Senor I suggest you stop in. They won't disappoint
