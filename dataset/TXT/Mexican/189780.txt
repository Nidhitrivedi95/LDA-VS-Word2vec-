OD09pm-MzynigAvD5KoGPA i normally hated mexican food in the past.  quite by accident, the line at the fast food next door was too long and my lunch hour was quickly fleeting - since I was hungry, I thought I'd stop in and atleast buy some sustanence so I could make it thru the day.  the food was absolutely the best and now the only mexican restaurant that I frequent at all.   this is a 5 star restaurant with 1 star quality prices.  great value & taste - I hightly recommend this place
