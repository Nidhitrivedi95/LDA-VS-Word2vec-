3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ Met some old high school friends for dinner a few night ago.

Pros: Great ambiance and service was really good.  I really wished I got his name as I would like to have given him credit.  Chips and salsa were good.  5-Stars.

Cons: The food, unfortunately.  I had the beef enchiladas and the sauce tasted like it came directly from a can from Safeway brand, and not the good stuff either.  :-)  2-Stars.

However, if given the opportunity I will probably go back and give them another shot.
