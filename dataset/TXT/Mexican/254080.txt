v0ubf7h2E0OfwGGfkI1S4w Great Mexican place to have lunch, dinner or just drinks, the bar is stuffed with a lot of great tequilas and the food is also great, the service is amazing, we tried veggie tacos and carnitas tacos, also guacamole and everything is great, good taste and fair prices, it is a must when you are going near Charlotte!!!
