xWpy6al-9u02BZz00Kbbyg Great food, Great wait Staff all dressed in black shirts and ties. Two of our group of six said it was the best Mexican food they'd ever had. Most of us had taco salads because we didn't want to eat heavy for lunch with a pending dinner reservation at 5 on the Strip in Vegas. I'll go out of my way to go to this restaurant again next time in the area. Drinks and meals for six was $95. (They do not do the lunch menu on the weekends) Located in a strip mall.
