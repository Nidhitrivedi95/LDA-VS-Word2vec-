XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg This is my third time eating at Mesa.  I didn't yelp it the first two times because everything I wanted to say was already written.  Then I realized Yelp isn't only about the restaurant, but also about the reviewer, so I thought I would review it just to add to my reviews.  I had the signture pork tenderloin.  The previous two times, somebody else ordred it and I'm the kind of person who wants to see variety on the table.  I was in Vegas by myself, so this was a perfect time to try the Tenderloin.  WOW!!  As good as everyone else has described.  The habanero tint to the sauce on top really gives it a nice heat.  Not too hot.  Just a warm feeling.  I asked for it Medium Rare nowing all chefs working with pork will tend to overcook it.  So, I got it between medium and medium rare.  Just the way I was expecting it.
