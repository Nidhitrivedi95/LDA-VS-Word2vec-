2lF1UsGcDpDpaI1lXgRX_g I have such mixed feelings about this place. I haven't been here in a few years and decided it would be a great place to celebrate my birthday. 
The cons: my son has a couple of food allergies but a grilled piece of chicken is a standard and reasonable item he usually has when we go out. I requested that and alerted my waiter to his food allergies. A manager came by and I was told that most of their meat comes pre-marinated and they didn't have the ingredient lists to be able to tell me what was in any of the marinades. Nor could they tell me what the ingredients were in items like the tortillas and was told that was because the day guys unpacked them all and threw out the boxes that listed all the ingredients. I get food allergies are a pain, so I wasn't concerned too much about what their allergy friendly foods were, it just sounded shady that they had no ingredient lists for any items I asked for. That should be a pretty standard thing they have in their office. They offered a bowl of fruit for him, of which he was fine with. Our waiter was also missing in action for long stretches of time. Despite turning 29 that day, I'm actually more like 80 and ate dinner at 5 and there was barely anyone in the restaurant. We waited a good 15 minutes between being seated before we received any drinks and barely saw him. 

The pro: Despite their weird pre made items with mysterious ingredients, the food was great. I actually quite enjoyed it. However, I probably won't be returning here. It was just a really weird experience.
