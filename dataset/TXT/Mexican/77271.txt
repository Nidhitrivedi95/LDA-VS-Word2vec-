cKgUCzMGuRgkbKXUsgeXUw For me, this place is more like 2.5 stars. We've been twice, the food is OK, but not amazing. The kicker for me last time was the "table side guac." The waiter through it together in 60 seconds, we continued to add lime to it and honestly mine is much better, for $10.75 I would never order it again. There is much better Mexican out there, but you can't beat the location.
