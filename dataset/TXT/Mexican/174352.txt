MmQsPiVSN08WtmlsC_ZSVA What a rip off! I ordered a steak bowl with no rice or bean, instead add extra veggies. I asked for 2 pico's, 2 of their other salsa's and a side of guacamole. It cost over $16!!! I figured at a Mexican Food place they would give you a couple free sides of salsa and expected to pay for the rest. Not here! I paid $4 for 4 sides of 2 oz salsas, .75 cents for some soggy mushrooms and pepper(wasn't expecting mushrooms) and $2.99 for a 2 oz side of guacamole.  Who charges extra for lettuce and peppers?  If a place is going to charge for some measly salsa and veggies they should at least let you know. Will never eat here again.
