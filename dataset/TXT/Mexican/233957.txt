SUd3IyEN7n5OYEGyt_U5lg Props to this place to being able to have a ridiculous amount of business for being in a gas station. I've always seen online posts about it but never knew exactly where it was located.

We went specifically for street tacos and we were not disappointed! I guess the owners are from San Diego and have their little flair of cooking style. We each had a carne asada, al pastor, and chicken street tacos. At $2 a taco with a minimum of 3 for the order, it was a steal. The al pastor was soooo good! By far our favorite. The green sauce was so spicy and the red sauce was even spicier! Beware! My tongue was on fire but it was oh so good.

The horchata and the lemon beverages were both delicious. We waited a total of about 35 minutes on a Saturday evening to order and receive our food. Apparently they get a wicked amount of online orders because every time we heard a ding another order came in, and those dings came often! I will definitely come back here again and most likely try to order online to avoid the hassle of hanging out inside a gas station. 

Don't let the location trip you up becuas2this place is amazing! Nice to have a good taco place on this side of town!
