lap6PTY8pyckPSMgvCuIbA I gave it a one, only because you can't give a 0. Went in on Friday night at approx. 6:30. Put in a to go order and the food took over an hour to get to the table. The waitress didn't even come back to let us know what was going to going on. Got one meal, and the other took 10 minutes more. Only saving grace was another server offered us a beer. We paid, and returned home to enjoy our food. Only to dig in, and the food was COLD. The second meal was not at all what was ordered. After an hour wait, and the place wasn't even full of customers.
