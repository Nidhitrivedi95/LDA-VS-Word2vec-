LGEIsxeJQATo9J1IA-TEdA It's been years since I have been here. I used to come in just for the peach margaritas.
We came here for a late lunch. It was about 2p.m. Wed. As we entered it looked like we beat the crowd. There were a few tables that needed to be bussed. It was quiet. We were seated in a comfortable booth. Our server Brenda was an exceptional waitress. We ordered the half pork and half shrimp fajitas. Of course a peach margarita. It was good but lacking alcohol.
The fajitas had lots of grilled onions and only three thin uncooked slices of bell pepper.
The shrimp were very salty, the pork was not all that. The tortillas were thick and hot. The salsa was just a chunky tomato sauce, no spices to give it that zing. I was disappointed, I saw the advertising about what a great dish the fajitas are on "Check Please"
I won't be returning. Valle Luna has a better fajita dish with beans and rice for less money.
