For the price I would have expected the staff to be dressed in better then super short holey cutoff shorts and a string tank top.
Cleanliness was also a factor, we cleaned off our table an wiped it down. After seeing the bus boy make swipes at the tables with the same cloth he had in his hand that he used to open the trash can! I am thankful we had cleaned our own table!
