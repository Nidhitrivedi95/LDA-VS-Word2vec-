ms7cmWkPiSBDTnz-1sv2kQ here goes, Ticoz, a bad review
afraid. what will the owner do?
see i don't harbor mal-intent
and haven't  broken, TOS yet
so please don't, Ticoz, jump my shit
like you did that other chick
who didn't care much for your food
called her out, i thought that rude
so risking hate mail, well, here goes
the food we tried at Ticoz, blows
i know, i'm sorry, wasn't good
i'd dish more stars, you know i would
if the host had greeted us 
within five minutes, in no rush
turns out he also waited tables
Ticoz, you're busy, and surely able
to hire someone, for up front
to meet and great and seat at lunch
liked our waiter, real nice guy
took our order, things we tried
included 'pozole'  served with lime
and cabbage, oops, i'll pass next time
i love posole, when done right
but only managed, a few bites
also the blue corn enchiladas
with sour cream sauce, sorry, notta
fan, too heavy and too rich  
stuffed shredded chicken, gotta bitch
same goes for your shredded pork torta
both proteins dry, the flavor sorta
like they'd seen a couple days
in a steam table, tasted that way
on the plus side, décor and vibe
cozy, hip, way cool inside
private dining room, great bar
trick patio all worth more stars
but the food, Ticoz, is why we came
not for drinks, though I must say
i could imagine, hanging out
cocktails only, highly doubt
i'd order food, but never say
nev....maybe the chef, had a bad day
