QMaaLfedGzNhHz6PZKAUkw One of the worst burritos I've ever had in my life. I ordered the taco burrito combo with sour cream on both. No sour cream on the taco and the service was unspectacular. When I first arrived in Tempe it was late and decided McDonald's over this restaurant. Best decision we ever made cause it would have started our new adventure off on the wrong foot. We will not be back!
