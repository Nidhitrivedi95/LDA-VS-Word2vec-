1_WfF9pNoNeWe233CeqE1Q Great casual food.  We bring every out-of-town guest here for some Mexican food.  Granted, I'm from NY so I'm not an expert on "authentic" Mexican food, but this place has food that I like.  My wife is very picky about her food, and they go out of the way to accommodate her requests.  

Her favorite is the Beef Machaca quesadilla, with whole wheat tortilla and half the amount of cheese- healthier option that they always get right.  We also tweak the Mexican Pizza to leave off the fatty sour cream and guac and add lettuce instead (gotta get those veggies in!).  Also very good are the Giant Carumba's Stuffed Burrito, Chicken Salad, and plain old tacos.  Also a must- the cinnamon crisps for dessert.  We've been treated several times to free desserts- for my birthday, just for coming in, etc.  For under $2, you can get a HEAPING platter of fried flour tortilla strips covered in cinnamon and sugar and honey.  DELICIOUS! 

The margaritas are very strong but taste like you're downing cheap tequila (which you probably are).  One is enough, but on Mondays and Tuesdays they're BOGO, which, at $3.75, is an awesome deal to get drunk fast!

Overall, a great place for a cheap (for the 2 of us it's usually less than $20 including drinks), quick meal.
