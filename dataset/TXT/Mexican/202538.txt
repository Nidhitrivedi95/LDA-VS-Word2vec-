pomGBqfbxcqPv14c3XH-ZQ I've been here a few times and to me the food isn't bad but not the best.  I do have a problem with the frozen margaritas.  On two occasions, the same thing: the margarita is liquid and not frozen, along with being not very cold.  I felt it sat in a blender all day and the ice melted and it was served.  I may go back, but I won't order a margarita.
