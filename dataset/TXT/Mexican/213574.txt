qWi9dNGo9D9I4F9RANc-6g This place is great! I've now had three different types of their tamales(pork,briscut, & short-rib) and they have all been fantastic.
They serve theirs with the meat on top, not filled like traditional style. But, the portions are huge and the flavor is undeniably delicious.
I've had all the guacs, and they do those good as well. I like the orange guacamole the best. It's kinda hard to mess up guacamole though.
I'm not that into margaritas, but my friends ordered the triple sampler and loved theirs. The Rooster being their favorite. I played it safe with just a pineapple 'rita and it was definitely refreshing and mixed perfect with real muddled pineapple, not just canned juice concentrate.
On to the service... I always sit at the bar and it's always been very friendly. Last time in, I had the bartender order for me and she delivered in a great way.
Also, on my last visit, the manager recognized my little group and without hesitation, brought all three of us a quality shot of tequila right off the bat on the house for being repeat guests. After our guac sampler came out, he surprised us with some sort of shrimp tapas. I don't know if it's on the menu, but it should be. A perfectly seasoned and spiced shrimp served over a little nest of spinach and some other ingredients I can't quite remember. That couple bites of food alone was a standout to my meal.
Highly recommend this place. No, you're not gonna get a soggy $3 Barrio style taco here. What you'll get is some of the best "Mod Mex" anywhere. This is a legit dinner operation. Not a bar for late night drunk hipsters.
The atmosphere is quite colorful and well adorned with pop-Mexican art.
If I had only one complaint, and this is a minor one, they are closed on Mondays when I'm usually off work. But many places in Lakewood are.
Try this place sooner than later!
