giCq1MmW-_S2tvNOAHvJcQ Um - Why have I never been here before?! This little shopping area continues to prove to me that I have been living under a rock for a little while...seriously!

Work took us here one day for lunch and we all enjoyed it. 3 of us had the burger and two had soup with a side of chick peas and the grilled cheese and tomato bisque. Not one complaint among us. 

Mark came over to say hey to us which was nice. Then, the owner of our company, was telling us great stories about the live music. Definitely need to check that out. 

I would 100% go back for lunch and really want to try dinner or just come in for some apps and a drink during music!
