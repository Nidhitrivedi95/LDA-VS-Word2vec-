ZKvbVqYc2OsqXSlYlNsBGA Had dinner last night at Don Tequila.  Since it was my first time eating here, I had to go with the fajitas.  My wife and I split the Texas fajitas for two and they were delicious.  The shrimp, beef, and chicken were tender and juicy, as were the mushrooms, onions, and green peppers.  We loved em!  They were definitely on par with Cozumel, our favorite Mexican restaurant.

The salsa was a little bland, but easily spiced up with the hot sauce sitting on the table. 

I had a large mango margarita, which was tasty, but didn't sport as much alcohol as I'm used to.  It was still very good frozen, nonetheless.

I'd visit again!
