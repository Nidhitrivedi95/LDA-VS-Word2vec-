Food/drinks- This is tapas place, which I didn't know, so was a bit surprised of the small size when the food came out. We got the guacamole which was pretty good. We also had pastor tacos and mini chicken burritos. The food was ok , nothing to rave about. My favorite was the desserts. We had tres leches and churros. The tres leches is small in size and is sooo good...a must try!!!!
The drinks were really good as well. Most of us got margaritas which was strong and tasty.
Service- the place was packed when we got there. There was a long line but thank goodness our friend made reservations (or 'reso' according the patio host) so we didn't have to wait. Note that reservations can only be made for inside. There, the hostess was pleasant and walked us to our seat. Our waitress was great. She was quick, helpful and seemed to enjoy her work. 
Atmosphere- Loved, loved, loved the decor inside. The patio was really nice too, with a fireplace in the middle. The inside lighting was dim but still was able to see all the nice decor. I think it was after 11 the DJ started playing music. It was a bit loud for conversation but we definitely enjoyed the music. 
So even though the food wasn't the best I've had (not complaining), the drinks, desserts and the atmosphere made up for it. Can't wait to go back!
