szlIcLQE7K-1JuKeJIRKsQ New Year's Eve and not busy at all.  Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

Turned out to be a good thing!  

Take this with a grain of salt (and a margarita, if you wish), but I don't go to many Mexican restaurants so I may not be the best to ask...but I liked it!

The sangria was great, and my friend had a margarita, which he said he enjoyed. 

I got the taco platter - which I customized into 2 carnita hard tacos and 1 ground beef hard taco.  I don't like rice and beans (which is why I frequent Mexican restaurants so little...as that is their 'go to' side) so I asked if I could substitute out for corn bread or fries.  After telling me 'no' (sadface), she wound up bringing fries after all!  

(ok, so they were fries at a Mexican restaurant: not that good...but they were better than beans!)

The tacos were very good.  I was especially surprised that the ground beef wasn't greasy and runny, which is the case of nearly every other ground beef taco I've eaten (both at restaurants and homemade...I don't know how beef just seems to absorb grease and then leak out onto your arm as you eat it).  The carnitas beef was good too.  My tacos were just great - I'd say some of the best I've ever had.  

My husband got the California burrito, which I was eyeing up because it came with a side of cornbread.  Because I'm his wife and he can't hate me forever, I helped myself to some of it and it was also very good.  Cornbread is something I do know, and I know Mad Mex's cornbread is wet, blue (?!) and gloppy.  THIS was some good cornbread. 

Overall, great experience, and a low-key restaurant for a quiet New Year's Eve.
I would definitely go again!
