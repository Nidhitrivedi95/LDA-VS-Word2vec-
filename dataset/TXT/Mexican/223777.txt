RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg I love the tacos here. So much in fact, that I sometimes convince my friends to stay at Encore just so we're walking distance from the joint. There is no questioning that the tacos here are some of the most delicious outside of Mexico and CA.

However, their ordering system and the the drunk, rude, and obnoxious patrons that they allow in here sometimes prevent El Gordo from a 5 star. If you are a big fan of different types of tacos you'll have to wait in multiple lines. The most efficient solution to that is to have one friend stand in each line and order up enough tacos for your whole group. But if you're a couple visiting Vegas and want to try everything from asada, al pastor, lengua, intestines, or brain, then good luck with that on a busy weekend night.
