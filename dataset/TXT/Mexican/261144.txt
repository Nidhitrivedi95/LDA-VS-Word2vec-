vT5mKKEcAxhSPj452HHspw I don't want this to be another 5-star to add to the hype, but this place really is pretty darn good. And cheap!

What we have here is a Mexican ice cream shop with some savory food items. Scoops of ice cream, shaved ice, combos of the two, fruit cups, and of course the lechera (sweetened condensed milk) on top of everything.

I had the obispo, which is a pick your own shaved ice and top it with your choice of ice cream. It's got some fruit in it, and a little lechera. It may not look big, but it's about $5 and probably enough to share. I also tried a little bit of the Macedonia, and it was also pretty darn good. Much prettier, with the sliced strawberries too.

I didn't try the warm food, and it would be tough with the place next door with a bigger menu. Perhaps they're the same, but you can order some basic Mexican quick dishes go go with your ice cream.

It's a nice atmosphere, very clean, and everything has dual English/Spanish translation. Lots of TVs, and plenty of small tables.
