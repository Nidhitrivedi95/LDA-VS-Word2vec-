PkL9tPTvvEtmBJvckrD_vg I came here because I was looking for a new fast serve burrito joint to try out and I must say I was pleasantly surprised with the service and quality of food I received. The guy who served me was very nice and had quite the sense of humour! The burrito itself was quite good, and better than I expected from a place like that. There wasn't any hint of dryness or chalky-ness, which personally I find hard to avoid at other burrito places. Definitely give this place a check if you want a change from the likes of Burrito Boyz or Barburrito.
