pomGBqfbxcqPv14c3XH-ZQ Amazingly, it has been a very difficult journey trying to find what I would consider a phenomenal Mexican restaurant in this town. I know because I have been searching for over 4 years with no luck, until today. I got a tip about Leticia's Mexican Cocina just yesterday. It is a very long way away from my house, but I felt good enough about the tip to drive all the way across town today to check it out for lunch. I ordered make your own combo which I chose the noodle soup, chicken enchilada with red sauce, beef tostada and added in an extra of Carne Asada.
Lunch started two very good salsa's and warm bean dip, and was quickly followed up with a very tasty tomato noodle soup!
The main course was nothing short of excellent. My fav was probably the carne Asada, but the other two were excellent as well. The beans and rice were a very nice compliment! The great news is that it is far and away the best Mexican food in Vegas in my opinion!!! My waiter, Walter was also great... Taking care of all my needs! The bad news is that it is 40 minutes away from my house, but I will be scooping up all my friends and diving back over to enjoy often!!! There was a group of 6 first timers across from me and all agreed that it wad thumbs up from everyone. One gal said I am glad I live in Cali or I would be huge if I lived close!!!
