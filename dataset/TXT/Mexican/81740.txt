d_L-rfS1vT3JMzgCUGtiow Worst place ever. I came here for a birthday dinner, my birthday thinking it would be a great new food place to try, and who doesn't love Mexican. We come to find a really horrible server who overcharged my card past tip for alcohol I didn't purchase. On top of that she gave us attitude, and she lost one of the checkbooks that had my friends change in it which came out to be $15 regardless how do you lose a checkbook? When we went to tell them about the issue they claimed we didn't even leave a decent tip, and basically didn't solve the problem, nor care. One of the workers also claimed our server left when she was still visibly in the restaurant. I wouldn't recommend you to come to this restaurant. It's trash, thank you.
