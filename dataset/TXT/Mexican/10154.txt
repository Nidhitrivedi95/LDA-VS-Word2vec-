_XN-GwzZwAyIqLKJsl2htg Absolutely worst place for customer service when things go wrong. It's not your typical attitude kind of place so it was refreshing to see that from the worker standpoint. It is like walking into a restaurant run by social political party and you have no idea who the manager is as it is run by everyone and the manager was nowhere to be found when we asked for one. Very interesting experience. Next time you go there ask for a manager to see if they exist.
