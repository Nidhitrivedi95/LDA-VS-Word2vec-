J5ebC7fKqrSF8KuS8d6hgw Three words: BACON WRAPPED SHRIMP! You have to try this appetizer it is out of this world delicious. I have been here a few times and have been extremely impressed each time. I have had their stuffed chicken w/ poblano sauce, asparagus, and green chile mashed potatoes and it is delicious (especially the green chile mashed potatoes)! The carne asada is cooked to perfection and comes with rice, beans, a homemade tortilla, and guacamole, my boyfriend ate the full portion and they are very generous in size! The pasta with poblano cream sauce is also amazing, but it is very filling so either be sure to come very hungry if you  order that! It also comes with chicken on it which the menu doesn't state. 

The second time we ate their I got the pork green chile atop rice and beans w/ a homemade tortilla. Can you say flavor train?! The flavors are fantastic although next time I will opt for the red option because it is more spicy. The bread pudding is not too sweet or soggy and I promise you will eat the whole thing, very dangerous! Even their drinks are spot on I have had a margarita and you can tell they fresh squeeze their citrus because it was divine, the best part is the chile powder and salt rim! YUM. I also love their Leffe beer it is light and does not have a strong after taste. 

I will be back here again and again and again!
