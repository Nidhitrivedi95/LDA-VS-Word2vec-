S8VRQCBrbZI04zjCOc1RAA Im a big fan of Mexican places, so I figured I'd give Palmas a try. Great decision. I walked right by it at first because I didn't realize that it's not a restaurant but actually a Mexican grocery store. I paid only $7.50, got 3 filling tacos, and the cook was pleasant. He heats up the tortillas, tops them with protein, and leaves you to add whatever else you want on em. Definitely give this place a try. It's down and dirty, but then again so is everything in So. O.
