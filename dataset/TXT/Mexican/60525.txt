AM0NHSxMeX92OKBt0ywmSA 4/5 for the cute decor.
2/5 for the table I sat at across from the bar. I hate eating at super tall tables. It is awkward. Next time I will request a table in the back.
5/5 for the old school hip hop playing.
5/5 for the server who was attentive.
4/5 for the reasonable price point on the food.
3/5 for the food I had. We had the chips and guacamole. They were pretty meh. I tried the Sunday special - a fried chicken sandwich. It tasted like General Tao chicken on a kinda stale bun. I am really sorry I didn't order a taco. 

Shit I noted. Their Chelada wasn't spicy. I wouldn't bother with it again. Secondly, they had like five thousand people working there and they are all very young. I felt like a senior, but that's okay. Finally, listening to ODB makes every meal better.
