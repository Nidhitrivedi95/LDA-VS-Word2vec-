XEHACBzEICqYouH1EgN1bA This Serrano's locale  just didn't make the cut for me . . . 

PROS: the chips, salsa and bean dip, of course!  Service was friendly, and the staff appear busy and focused, which I like.

CONS: the margaritas are, in a word, lame.  Whoever mixes up the marg machine to accommodate the house margarita (vice the specialty margs) needs to add some tequila to the mixture WITHOUT the use of an eye dropper.  Seriously, I hate being charged for an alcoholic beverage when I can detect no alcohol in my drink. For all I know, I was having a lime slushy . . . we came to a 50% full restaurant on a Friday at 7:00 p.m., and after we ordered, our meal took a full 25 minutes to get to our table.  Everyone else seemed to wait a maximum of 10 minutes.  No explanation from our friendly waitress . . . I got the ground beef chimmy, and the meat just didn't have that much flavor, and the tortilla lacked crispness for a meal that was supposed to be fried

Not much more to say . . . 

Cheers!
