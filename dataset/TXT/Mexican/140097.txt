J7B-hSSYDYSIQx5xiqOJTw So far since being seated our waitress acts as if she doesn't want to be here. We had to get our silverware from another table, our trash from the bags of chips and salsa bowl has been sitting at the end of our table for about 15 minutes, even after food was given to us she just left it there, and our food all came out at different times. The food that has come out so far looks really good. 
But far as service goes.... It sucks!
