GRs6OxKZREAwA_Nmp2GmVw I do not know what is happening lately here at this restaurant. Prices have jumped up, and the quality is going down hill fast. It appears they are using a frozen onion and bell pepper blend now. It does not grill right, and stays very wet. I had over 3oz of water leak out of my burrito tonight. What a mess, and the taste was meh.
 I asked to speak to the manager and was told he only works in the morning.
