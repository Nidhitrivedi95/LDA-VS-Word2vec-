MQLnw9COMm2wOvjKI9Qn5A So apparently this place opened up a month ago (it's a couple of doors down from Boston Pizza). Thank goodness for a local burrito spot and even more so for actually being really good! 

There was just one other customer there when we went in. Two guys were working there, both were really informative and friendly. They helped us decide what to order, I ended up getting the Baja burrito in the regular size (regular, large and huge options available). 

No regrets. Super filling and it was delicious! The hot sauce is actually really hot (but yum) so I'd suggest trying it first. The chicken has a nice BBQ flavour to it and was crispy. 

There is room to dine in. I will definitely be back to try the other stuff on the menu. From the top of my head, they do burritos, burrito bowls, chips, quesadillas and poutines. Definitely check it out if you're in the area and want a bite. 

5/5 -- great first impression.
