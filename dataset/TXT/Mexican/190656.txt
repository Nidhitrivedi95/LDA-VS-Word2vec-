of4V8nfW7GwJ03tLDdrOlA My daughter was ready to enjoy a fantastic lunch at this well-placed eatry. However, the way that she was treated was unconscienceable. My daughter is a beautiful brown-black girl who is open-minded and accepting of others. But these people who are descendents of immigrants from Europe, waiting on and serving my daughter wanted to strike a negative chord in the heart of a gentle soul. After their negative treatment, she left the restaurant telling them she did not want "this." And by this meaning, not just the food, but that kind of treatment. I applaud her courage.
