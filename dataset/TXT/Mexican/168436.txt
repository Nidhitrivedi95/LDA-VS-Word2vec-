LVFcpLkD6iOG8YRlJjLSig I recommend the chip, salsa and guacamole to start!!! The salsa is homemade and amazing!!!
Next up the Hot chicken wings which were perfect:) Honestly... They were better than Natives chicken wings!!
Chicken quesadilla is a must too!!!
Shrimp tacos are delicious as well with the rice and beans
Kids got the chicken tenders! They are pretty picky when it comes to them, but they loved them and had the coating every kid loves!!!!
Eating at Flickas is a must!!! Stop by for lunch or dinner if you are in the area:)
