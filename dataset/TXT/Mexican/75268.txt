CiGvnoHtvvzra2RB23lNpQ Let's start off with the food itself, every time I go here, my food is wet, cold, and looks disgusting. I always get a chicken quesadilla and it always ends up being cold, and the cheese is NEVER melted. My soft tacos ended up being wet.. how do you even explain why.. and the customer service is okay.. a few people are very nice and the rest have VERY bad attitudes.
