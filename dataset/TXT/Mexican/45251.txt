7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA Came here with a friend after seeing all the great reviews. I ordered the breakfast poutine and she ordered the huevos rancheritos. It took forever because they were so busy, not sure why because when our food came it sucked. Mine was basically day old hash browns with melted cheese on top, the miso gravy was basically non existent and there was probably 2 little slivers of scallion on top. My friend hated hers, they have her runny scrambles eggs mixed with runny salsa, the black beans were stuck together like mud. Really unappetizing. The only saving grace of the meal was the latte I got, it was well made and delicious. That and the cute pairs of different salt and pepper shakers on each table. Unfortunately, they are not what is going to make me ever step foot inside for any brunch ever again.
