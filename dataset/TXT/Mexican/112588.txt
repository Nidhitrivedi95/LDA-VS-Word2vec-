G82YlEU6yxA3autN309W7Q Love the food.   My favorite is the carne Assad burrito.   Employees are never friendly.    Today the guy working drivethru was just weird.    My total was 10.13 and he refused to give me my change.    Usually I wouldn't care about 87 cents but it was weird.   He tried to say it was tax.   I showed him my receipt that tax was charged.      He reluctantly gave me my change and slammed the window.     I won't be going back for awhile.
