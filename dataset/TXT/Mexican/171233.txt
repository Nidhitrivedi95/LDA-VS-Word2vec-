M93N96pw4t_Rc3ACDm2dcw My friends and I were getting together before the rugby match last Sunday so we stopped here before our long walk to the stadium in the rain. I am used to good Mexican food coming from NYC and heard that all the Mexican food here is no good, but that doesn't seem to be true! I had a chicken burrito with black beans and pico de gallo. Pinto reminded me of the famous Chipotle chain where you get to decide what you want on your burrito as you go down the line. For the price and the size, I was full and happy. I ate the whole thing so it couldn't be that bad! I might stop by again if I am walking by and need a quick bite and I'm in the mood for a burrito.
