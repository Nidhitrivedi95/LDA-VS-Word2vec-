gldPX9ANF5Nic0N7igu2og Went here around 730 on a Saturday with two friends.  It wasn't overly busy we got right in.

We were very excited to try it however the services was atrocious.  They brought my friends drinks out incorrectly 3x.  The waitress kept running away before I could even order one.  Once I finally did it came out 30 minutes into us being there because she forgot it. 

We ordered chips and salsa.  Salsa was good, the top few chips were good, the rest were crushed, like inedible without a spoon crushed.  

Got past that and finally got out Taco orders in.  The tacos are more like 3 stars - pretty good.  I loved the different options you can create for yourself.  Tacos are reasonable and good size portion.  I got the pork and the chicken.  Pork was way better than the chicken.  Didn't love that they didn't have traditional corn tortillas as an option, but they have other unique shell options that are reminiscent of Taco Bell (in a good way). 

The menu situation is also weird, there's like 4 different menus.  I don't understand why they can't condense it to 2 menus, one to order off of and one for drinks.  I would go back to give them another shot on service and chips, but not running back.
