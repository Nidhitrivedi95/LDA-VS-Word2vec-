6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA If you appreciate good food, cocktails, a clean, well-kept restaurant, and quality service you will be disappointed. This used to be a good restaurant, but is completely run down and the food is mediocre, at best. The chicken on the Caesar was terribly dry. The "remoulade" for the crab cake tasted like tartar sauce mixed with French dressing.  The mojito was made with a mix, too sweet to drink.  And the server came to our table of eight with our drinks and called each one out for us to raise our hands. Then she came out with our food and called out our dishes for us to raise our hands.  Really?

As for the atmosphere, the carpet has holes worn in it. The women's bathroom had moldy wood molding and a 3' x 3' hole in the wall covered by a black plastic trash bag taped over it.  As for the awful, old fake plants throughout the restaurant, I don't know what they are thinking. 

I give the extra star for the salsa, everything else was gross.

Owners of this restaurant have no shame and no pride.  I was embarrassed to be the one who recommended my seven friends eat there.
