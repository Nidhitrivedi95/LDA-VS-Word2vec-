PRUsjqm4hWbmmI_lgj6hzg Put down what you are doing right now and drive yourself to The Grande Stand. Ryan and I each have a running list of the 5 best burgers of our lives. Ryan's fluctuates every so often. But mine never changes. Until today. 

They grind their meat every day at Grande Stand. That makes such a difference! The cheese is so thick and in perfect ratio and harmony to the party. It's like next level In & Out and Shake Shack. The fries are hand cut each day and reminded me of "The Great Steak and Fry Co." The Shake was so thick, the blender was really working to blend it up. I asked for a chocolate shake and boy, did I get one! 

Quentin is exactly who you would want behind the counter. He was friendly, approachable and completely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the menu. 

So the Royale or the standard? First off, you must add buttered, grilled onions to your Standard burger order. It makes the burger. Secondly, I added bacon to my standard burger. It was delicious and rich. But to switch things up, you could skip bacon and just enjoy the meaty goodness in the burger. 

Ryan got the Royale and man, is it fit for a king! Guacamole, bacon, grilled onions, a double patty on a brioche bun to stand up to all of those additional add ons! 

The street corn is actually what brought us in. Man! It was incredible. The flavors are spot on. I took it back with us for a late night snack! 

As I mentioned, don't miss out on the opportunity for fries and a shake. It's worth the calories. Sometimes you have to live a little and as my friend Dave says, "if you are going to be a bear, be a grizzly." I think that about sums up this place. It's a grizzly bear's dream. Coming back later this week for tacos and cocktails! Can't wait. 

Thank you Quentin and thank you The Grande Stand for one of the top 5 burgers of my life!
