GrwvBAEALujIOPQeOfN1vA Holy crap - this place has the best kept secret - an amazing taco Tuesday deal! All you can eat tacos for $9.99? what?!?! Even if you only eat two, they're amazing, and it saves you $5 on their regularly priced taco plates. Also on Tuesday they offer a $5 top shelf margarita. :::smiles::: It's a from scratch bar too . . . . so real juice, not a mix. I can't believe it took me so long to figure out this magical secret!
