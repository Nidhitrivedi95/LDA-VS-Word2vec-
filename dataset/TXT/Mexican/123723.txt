I have been here a few times and everything I have tried so far has been superb. My introduction to this place was the bibop salad. It is bibimbop without the rice. The flavors are good, but I am not sure if it justifies the $8.99. I have also tried the Korean BBQ and spicy beef burritos. Both were delicious, but the flavor of the Korean BBQ was better. The flavor was in the beef instead of just smothering it in sauce like the spicy beef. It is also filled with four different kinds of lettuce, tomato, avocado, rice and cheese. Personally, the cheese felt out of place amongst the other ingredients and overpowered the meat.  For $5.99, you get a great meal that will fill you up without leaving you feeling weighed down. 

By the time I had ordered, I saw their special was a kalbi quesadilla. It was too late. That's ok, it just gives me an excuse to go back.
