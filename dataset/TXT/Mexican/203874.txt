PQWE8a6Opjiuzt7DaX2R6Q Blue Agave's fish tacos are like wow. Best place (next to Central Phoenix's Barrio Cantina) to go for fish tacos. But apart from that, their menu is good, not incredible. 

I second what someone else said - that it's kind of "Scottsdalian Mexican food."  It's definitely not authentic, kind of modded up for the trendiness of North Scottsdale, and I think the prices reflect that as well.  I wouldn't say it's grossly overpriced, but I'd say it's right at the point where if they charged any more it'd be a rip off. 

As it is the place is always clean with fresh salsa and tasty food, plenty of beer and margaritas to go around. I recommend it highly as it's not a chain - and for that alone I like it - and for a comfortable and clean atmosphere for a good night out.  I've also been told that it turns into more of a club on weekends, sad to say I've never been there to see that - but I'm sure it's pretty good spot (well, as good as they come in North Scottsdale).  

Now, having finished my review, I'm thinking back - I like Blue Agave, but I LOVE Pinatas. You should go there instead.
