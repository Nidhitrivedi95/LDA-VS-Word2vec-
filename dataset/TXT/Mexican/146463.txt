JkzqS4JDOpoHrj534rzvAA I thought it would be pretty neat to try out IHOF since we are a family of 4 and we all have different tastes of what we wanted to eat for that night. Plus Yelp has many good reviewed. So we pull up, this is our first time here and I was excited. There was only one other family in the restaurant and were immediately greeted by our server Cruz, she was very friendly. I ordered the huaraches, my husband ordered the orange chicken and my kids ordered a meat lovers breakfast and bean and cheese tostadas. We also ordered 4 of the fresh juice drinks. The food came out and I would say it was a nice portion of food. Although the food was not great. It was good but not great. The orange chicken felt like it was straight out of a frozen bag. The huaraches were ok, a little bland in flavor I had to dump a bunch of sauce on it to taste something and it felt as though the beans were dry but a plus was that the carne asada was soft. I didn't get to try out the bean tostadas but my daughter seemed to enjoy them. I did try out the pancakes which those were good. Overall I don't think I will be back, to me $55 was way to expensive. We like to eat out and we have eaten at plenty of other restaurants for less than that.
