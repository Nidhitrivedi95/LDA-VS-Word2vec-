iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg The food is amazing! All of it. This place offers 3 small tables, so don't expect to be able to sit down. Their tacos are small, but very flavourful. Ingredients are well marinated and fresh. This is a fast food joint. One of the best in the city. If you love tacos, you have to come here.
