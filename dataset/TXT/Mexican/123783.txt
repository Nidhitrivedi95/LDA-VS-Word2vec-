hmEM8tyaD04mf6VXPG5JhQ My coworker and I noticed Quesada as we were walking on Dundas looking for a new lunch place. The interior is painted a welcoming red with a couple tables and chairs for diners. Most of the customers are employees from nearby buildings coming for take out.

We ordered regular sized burrito bowls with an extra side of guacamole (75 cents only!). The servers were generous with toppings and the lid barely fit. I got spicy chicken as the protein, which the man working said was a crowd favorite. The total came to about $8.50, which is a reasonable price for take-out in the area. 

The guacamole was REALLY good and they definitely didn't skimp. I would come by again.
