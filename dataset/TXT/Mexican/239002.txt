T-wer_1iIXs692gYrTriDg I had beef tacos, chicken tacos, and the asian fries. Everything was delicious. The fries, while DELICIOUS, were a little out of place since I dont usually eat fries with my tacos. Other people might really like them together.  I waited for my food and then just ate in my car. I would definitely recommend this place and I will be back soon. The owner was incredibly nice.
