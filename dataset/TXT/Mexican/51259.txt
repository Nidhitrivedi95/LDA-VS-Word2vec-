95CCHowiE0W_ovv5-9lQAQ New to the Vegas area so I have been using yelp to decide on new places to eat, fat boy had pretty good reviews so today my family and I decided to eat there. Glad we made the choice! It was delicious we had pastrami sandwiches and asada fries, can't wait to go back and try some different menu items! Also really good customer service, they hollered at us as we left to thank us and tell us to have a good day, you don't see that often anymore!
