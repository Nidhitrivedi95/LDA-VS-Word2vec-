NOfbzTpQ7hrt6ZbJVeXUUw To start.. well they have very few food selections. The guacamole was freshly made but tastes just average.. the chorizo fries was way too salty!!! And it was more like salty chili fries I didn't taste chorizo. The fajitas were fine but for the price I expected more. On the good side the servers were very nice and very attentive. Oh and the happy hour were only on selected drinks, food not included on happy hour. About 3/4 of the menu were drinks/alcohol.
