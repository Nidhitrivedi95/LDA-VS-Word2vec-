They been there a number of years and they have a great burger. Its a quaint little shop with a fun, upbeat group of employees/owners. The owners are totally laid back and recognize all of their regulars. Its a great atmosphere every time I'm there. 

They have a really tasty pretzel bun and their pickled zucchini topping brings an awesome bite to the burgers.

Totally worth checking out if you're in the area.
