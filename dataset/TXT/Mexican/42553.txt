75vRgse6O3P4GL_vi3Xr9Q Best tacos in Phoenix whether sober or drunk. You can't beat the $1 per taco! If you like nachos get the super mega nachos!!! It's a mix of gooey cheese, meat, and unicorns. Also ask for grilled onions and chiles to enjoy with your meal. The horchata is ok, but could be better. The wait is usually long after 9 pm but worth it!  My husband and I share the mega nachos and about 6 tacos and eat for under $20 with two drinks.
