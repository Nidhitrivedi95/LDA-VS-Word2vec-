6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA Great experience!!!!

Highly recommended by the hotel I was staying at, my colleagues and I decided to try this restaurant for a "Phoenix experience"

The chips and salsa we started with were seasoned uniquely and delicious. Our pitcher of margarita was good too.

Entrees are big and nicely plated. I got the special, a sesame tuna with squash noodles. The tuna could have been a little more rare to my taste but the noodles made of squash were yummy.

The indoor/outdoor atmosphere was great.

Highly recommended!
