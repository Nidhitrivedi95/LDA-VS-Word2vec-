P8rCpSJ4uWNE__pypJsgGA I would have given this place 3 stars based on a handful of visits, cool decor and some interesting swing-seats. It seems like a good place for a date, although from what I remember it was a bit pricey.

I've thought about returning, until I heard that the bar management thinks jokes about domestic abuse are a good way to sell drinks and bring in business. Now I KNOW there is no need for me to return. Sexism and misogyny are bad for business.
