zr2wA55AskfBJxrvUeDZRA I'm all about the burrito and so is Tejano! I really enjoyed my first visit hear, I had a vegetarian burrito and Vanessa had  a pulled pork tostada. The ingredients were all fresh and tasty and we were both pleased with our experience here. 

The menu is simple and the prices are reasonable so I think that this place will do well. Tejano is a great addition to the ever expanding Sud-ouest restaurant scene.
