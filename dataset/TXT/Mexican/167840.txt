Lu8ueuI4LF5i6_km0ip0xw Terrible experience. From the 45 min long wait to the unfriendly service. Vegetarians be ware of the rice and beans since the meat slops over causing cross contamination! 
My experience was awful. Hardly any beans which they did not strain and they added so much sauce I literally had a soup inside of a tortilla. Since no one wanted to touch my soup, the customers behind me were helped before me. Finally someone added cheese and pico into my burrito. I asked for sour cream and quac and the staff was arguing that it would be extra for both after he had scooped it on. Which he then finally agreed the guacamole comes on it and he could scoop off the sour cream. I was so hungry from the 45 min wait I really didn't care, I just wanted to eat. Then my bf was at checkout and she was asking anything else? And he had to state we were waiting on my burrito. Then the two employees argued over who was going to have to wrap my soupy burrito. 
Believe it or not, my soup didn't taste that good either haha
