MQAh7G93keNYlFKTus2CDQ Just moved here from Cali, and in Cali you could get a raspado on almost every corner. Over here in vegas this is the first place we tried to get a taste of good ol Mexican sweets like back home and we were not disappointed. The auga frescas are all amazing and the staff was delightful and kind! Can't wait to go back and try more of their menu!
