JJe0yIYC_M3la1Qbm9i3UQ TWO WORDS: WING WEDNESDAY. Hands down the best wings I've ever had in Cleveland! The place is no frills, but if what you are looking for is incredible wings this is the place. I had the Garlic Parmesan wings (amazing sauce) and the Jamaican Jerk (dry rub) and they were both great!
