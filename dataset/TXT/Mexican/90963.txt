DYnFGGYU3SkrKT_G4djpYQ So disappointed with this location. I am a regular visitor to the store at the 101 and Via de Ventura. I've given this location two chances. After tonight's visit, I will not be going back. 

Both of the burritos I ordered to go were COLD - we heated them up at home. My husband is consistently disappointed with the size of the burritos and what you get for the price, especially for having to pay extra for cheese and sour cream. They threw one small green and one small red salsa in my bag for two burritos. The location I frequent offers regular, spicy & green and asks you what salsa(s) you want for each order.

From my understanding, each location is franchised, and really hope this owner steps up their game!!
