iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg Delicious tacos.  I got the catch of the day and the carnita.  Tacos are $5 each which is a little pricey for the size but very filling and tasty.  They ran out of ceviche and said to come earlier next time (I was there at 7pm).  Orders take about 10-15 minutes  (they were pretty busy) but it's worth the wait.  Be careful with the hottest hot sauce, it almost blew my face off.   Love the simplicity of the menu.  Any more items and you venture beyond the capacity and scope of the restaurant.  Very friendly staff.  I'll be back for ceviche!
