XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg I LOVE this place! Things I'm in love with here.... smoked salmon quesadillas, ahi tuna nachos, and the salad with goat cheese in it. As a native Texan, I'm pretty picky about Margaritas and the ones here MORE than pass the test... no nasty slushies here folks. Oh, and have to throw in that lunch is pretty reasonably priced for gourmet dining. Lunch for 2 will throw you back $50, but it's definitely $50 well spent!
