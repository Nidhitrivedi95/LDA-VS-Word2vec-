GoMlPsj-w62P58ZjUPYKmw The service here is by far the worst service I've ever received at a Chipotle restaurant. I won't be coming back to this location again.  The server argued with me on my son's very simple burrito bowl and then proceeded to charge me extra because he said my son got a double scoop when he didn't. Attitudes all around except from the cashier who was very nice and accommodating.
