dAcaMSkrpYUZocqrLvOzRQ I ordered the carne asada with fries.  It is listed, I believe, on the board as an appetizer.  However it is HUGE. HUGE!  It's served on a large oval dish/platter, with french fries at the bottom (which is, I understand a mexican socal thing) and oodles to yumminess on top: minced grilled/cooked steak, onion, lots of cheese, guac, salsa, and crema.  Maybe some lettuce?  Anyway, it's one of those dishes you eat and eat and eat and don't make a dent in.  I have yet to finish one, and I always go in with an appetite.  So it's really a lunch for today and a meal for later.

For $8.25 it is a steal.  You still get those homemade chips and salsa (the leftover I spooned onto the carne asada) and with a drink it's about 12 bucks with a tip.  Can't go wrong.
