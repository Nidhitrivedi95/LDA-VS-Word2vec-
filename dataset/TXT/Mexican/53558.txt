The only negative here is that the taste of their tacos tend to be a bit on the bland side. Despite using spit-grilled pork to prepare their al pastor tacos, the meat was fairly dry and tasted unseasoned. The same could be said of their fish tacos too, which I found to be lacking in flavour. 

They have made some strides in improving their food, however, since the time of their opening. I notice that they now add a generous amount of pineapple to both their fish and al pastor tacos. This ingredient certainly adds a much needed kick of sweetness and tart to their bland tasting protein. There is still much more room for improvement, however. 

For some immediate reprieve of your taste buds, you can try adding one of their 3 house made salsas to your tacos for free! You can sample these after ordering as well, since they usually have some nachos near the cash for this purpose. 

All in all, a great place to pick up some filling tacos while on a budget (most of their tacos go for $4). But definitely not the best tacos you can find in this city.
