Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ Came here for breakfast and the food was great and cheap! Only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is the server. My husband and I were a little tired and thirsty from the night before. We needed some water and food to get us through the day. We waited about ten minutes before a server came to just get our drink order, which was just water. We were ready to order, but they had to come back to get our order? Finally after another 15 minutes, he returned and got our order. Luckily the food came out super quick, then it was time for the check and we waited about 20 minutes for the check. For the price of breakfast compared to other places in Vegas, this place is awesome. For $10, you get eggs, bacon, toast and breakfast potatoes. And you have a nice view of the strip and hotels if you eat outside. I think they can do a bit better with the service though!
