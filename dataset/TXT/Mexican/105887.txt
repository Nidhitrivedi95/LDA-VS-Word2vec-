fjvu3PkvrTOoIjNqL1vrJQ What a great place! 

Ambiance is great, clean and modern touch to the interior design. There was even light mist spraying near the outdoor seating for those hot summer days in AZ! There also seats available at the bar and a separate seating area for dining. 

The staff was great. Didn't have to wait long for our food which by the way was DERICIOUS! I recommend the Cornmeal Crusted Mahi Mahi.
