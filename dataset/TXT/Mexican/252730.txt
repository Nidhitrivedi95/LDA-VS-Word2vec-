UtZgmOHDW_fbXasbTuZhWA This is the second time I've been to 
this location I have been disappointed both visits.

This  location is brand new and I understand their help may not be up to standards but when I asked for onion rings to be cooked well done
I even verified with the lady taking my order


 I expected the onion rings to be well done these clearly are not cooked as I requested 
Cooking Big Onion Rings to a crispy well done is not rocket science!!

The burger was not great ....
I've had better at both of the other locations on
Decatur and the one on Eastern Avenue

Farmer  Boys  get your game on ... 
or it's a no go for me!!
