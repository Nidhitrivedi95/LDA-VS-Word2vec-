Wc9UpJhOcdSj7olZkz7SJA My first time here. Very good burgers. Got the regular with cheese, fries, and tried the horchata, which was really good. Looks like they are no longer serving tacos. Went thru drive-in, which was a little slow, but the food was made to order. Fries crispy and hot, and the dipping sauce was excellent.
I will definitely go back.
