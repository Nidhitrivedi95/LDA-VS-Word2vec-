cYhv7XVpqJIpb6BLzZBaFQ I don't know why we even come here anymore, except that it's close.  We maybe come here once every couple of years, and every time, I ask myself the same question.  The salsa is not that great, the refried beans are way too salty, and the food is not that spicy.  The pitcher of margaritas might as well be called lime juice on the rocks........if there was any tequila in there, it must have walked through with its boots on.  Hopefully I will remember this in another couple of years when someone suggests going there, and not waste the money!
