First, they start with fresh (still hot!) tortilla chips and six fresh-made salsas. They keep them all filled for you. Even if you're just getting drinks, you get the best chips and some of the best salsas ever.

The servers are unfailingly excellent. They're efficient, friendly, and sincerely interested in making sure you enjoy your meal. Head and shoulders above most service in the Valley. Also: They're ridiculously hot. It's the little details :-)

The food is standard American-style Mexican fare. Not a lot of options, but they do it well. All the meat is grilled. Just grilled. Not smothered in salt and seasonings. It's just delicious. The idea (I think) is that you can build your own flavor with the salsas they give you. 

All the veggies are fresh. The cheese is real. Most everything seems to be assembled right before serving, so there's none of that mushy textureless stuff you get at most Mexican places. 

The restaurant is immaculate every time I go in. No sticky tables, no crumbs in the seats. 

This isn't white tablecloth dining, but for what it is, it's the best.
