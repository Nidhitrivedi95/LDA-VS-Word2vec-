cdkzUI1tXc8rUMF33iKMlg The $3.50 fried fish taco I got was, disappointing. The fried fish was more like a fish stick that had been microwaved. The taco was smaller then expected. Carnitas taco had no flavor. The queso we ordered was pretty much cold in the time it took to get from the kitchen to our table, which wasn't long, it was just low quality queso. If you're from the south where you can get quality tacos, don't go here. If you're from anywhere else, you've probably never have a good taco and won't know the difference, so this place will probably be ok to you. Lastly, the whole place smelled like the air freshener found in the bathroom. It was a nice smell, but very much overpowering and not what one typically wants to smell when eating.
