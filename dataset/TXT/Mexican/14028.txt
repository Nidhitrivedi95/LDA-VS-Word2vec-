0QSnurP5Ibor2zepJmEIlw We went to Desert Breeze Park, afterwards we were hungry so we walked across the street and saw 
"Tacos La Mexicana", it's very clean, great ambiance, extensive menu, very reasonably priced!
I ordered the Chile Relleno burrito, my wife got the Carne Asada Quesadilla, my daughter the beef and bean burrito. My Chile Relleno burrito was to die for, the flavor was off the charts, the pepper perfect, the cheese inside the pepper plentiful and melted to perfection, the rice, beans, and shredded beef were perfectly balanced as to not over power the Relleno pepper. My wife loves Quesadillas, she swore it was the best one she ever had! My daughter is a finicky, picky eater, she ate the whole burrito....woofed it down! Tacos La Mexicana will now be in our top five list of eateries that we frequent on a weekly basis. The service was four star as well. Thank you guys we LOVE your eatery!
