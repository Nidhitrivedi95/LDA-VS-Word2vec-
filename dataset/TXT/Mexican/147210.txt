jppxrDQLXr4Nk8cV7IGlcw I had high hopes for this place because of all the great reviews. Unfortunately, the service and quality did not live up to my expectations. The atmosphere was really cool, it definitely looks like a neat little Mexican place. I went with my boyfriend so there were only two of us for lunch. Even though the place was half empty, it took a good 10 minutes before the hostess noticed we were there and seated us. My boyfriend and I both ordered tacos with no appetizer. It took longer for our entrees than it did the table of four next to us to get their appetizers and entrees! When our tacos finally came, they didn't have much flavor. We were very disappointed. I couldn't even finish my pork tacos because they tasted so bad. The food was way overpriced for the quality and portions. They wanted $24 for one enchilada! No way! To top it off, my boyfriend and I had stomach aches for the rest of the day. We will not be coming here again. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because of the cool atmosphere. We would have been better off going to Taco Bell.
