sJHf_8i4iky2yU4-PS1ksQ My friends and I were in the mood for Mexican so we tried this place.  I had remembered a Mexican woman say to me that in order to tell if a Mexican place is good make sure there are lots of Mexicans earring in there. She recommended this place to me. Let me say that I really enjoyed the food. The chips at the beginning. The refried  beans yum. The toppings are fantastic. It's unfortunate that there is no alcohol because a corona or a sol is all that is missing from this great meal
