Jd2NUZeVeyWi1tTNKXMt1Q Hands down best Mexican food in the valley. I literally live in Peoria and make the drive here just for the food. I crave it in a daily basis. Not to mention the green chili is out of this world! You can get mild or hot and of course being from New Mexico I get the hot. It does not disappoint. 
The service is always amazing and the food is always great. I love the chips and salsa they bring before the food with four choices of dips for the chips. I always seem to overeat when I come here because it is addicting! I literally eat till I am sick! It is worth the drive and if you haven't eaten here you have to do it ASAP!
