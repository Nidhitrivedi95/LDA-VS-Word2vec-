J3YktOV6HCQYIVRU_lVZJA I usually love me some chipotle, but this time I was severely disappointed. The main problem that I had was with one of the managers. The main manager there, a rather tall and bald african american, consistently sweats and then handles food. Now, I am not talking about a little sweat from an afternoon jog, i'm talking about a full on marathon sweat all over his forehead and face. This time, he was sweating so bad that I simply couldn't bear it any longer and left the line shortly before ordering. 

Please resolve this, it is very unsanitary.
