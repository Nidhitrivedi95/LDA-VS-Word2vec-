OU5RFlwAoNaG32P-ZTlgYQ Big drop off the star ladder. The double chicken avocado salad was my choice, but after arriving home, almost half of the chicken was ineligible to be eaten. It was either rubbery or fatty and chewy. The other half of the chicken was good, but some soggy lettuce doomed most of the salad, even though the dressing was served on the side. At about 7 bucks, this wasn't a great deal or meal. Watch your chicken people.

UPDATE: Customer service and manager responded to my online complaints in a timely fashion. They were both nice and gave me coupon codes for free food.
