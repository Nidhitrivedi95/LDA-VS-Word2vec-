D9Uf7UmU2KlgS_H8lJwOrA I went to B.B. for the first time last week, and, surprisingly, it was pretty good!
Not sure if it was "the best" burrito I've ever had, but, i enjoyed it enough that I'll definitely be back!
Hits all of the key things; good food, fair price, decent service, and, despite the odd location, very clean bathrooms! (This should be more like 3.5 stars.)
If you're in need of a burrito fix, and you're in the St Lawrence Market area, walk a little further East on Front and check out Bolet's!
