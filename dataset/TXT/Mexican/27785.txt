3IwCop28R1_L5jMv6AkL8Q I mean seriously Yelpers, I'm getting so tired of your positive reviews over restaurants that totally stink! Leaving positive reviews for crappy places like this are starting to make me wonder if you know much better than McD's quality, This place cannot even fry a taco shell crisp! They were like wilted sorry wet tortillas on my plate. The chicken and beef both tasted like Alpo dog food, and the taquitos were soft and wet as well. They weren't even deep fried,they were grilled. To top that off, this place focuses on filling you up with carbs instead of protein. All of their burritos have rice and beans inside them, a total sign that their gonna be cheap with their meat portions. You guys would be better off closing your doors then continuing to think that your food quality or taste is anything better than crap. Fast food chains have crispier tacos than you guys! I'm so tired of crappy restaurants popping up all over town thinking you have us fooled! You will be gone before you blink an eye; and luckily you only got $30. bucks of mine. Do us all a favor and go back to Jalisco to learn how to cook Mexican food. Nobody wants your over wet plates of soggy tortillas and crappy quality meats. Oh and I almost forgot, their menu is upcharge central on their combo plates if you want your meat upgraded to carnitas or carne asada, and even if you want a chile relleno it's pay more! WTH Jalisco? You go bye bye now...
