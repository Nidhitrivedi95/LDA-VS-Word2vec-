cUFBO-5Fgd7pR0JUakWXSw I went here for a weekday lunch, and I highly recommend it. The food is elegant and well prepared. I began with a steamed clam soup, which could have been a meal unto itself. Followed with a brisket sandwich, which was large and spiced perfectly. The pumpkin bread dessert is a luxury. Service was prompt and attentive. The weather was pleasant which made sitting outside a nice bonus. Will definitely repeat when visiting Scottsdale
