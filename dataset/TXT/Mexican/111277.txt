g-aAe8SqZlZTnN3oA8mNlw Seems odd to leave a great review for a fast food place, but this Del Taco location deserves it. I used to live near here, but have moved a few miles away - I still drive to this location because I've never had a bad experience here! The food is delicious and hot every time. The staff is *outstandingly* friendly, consistently! They're always happy to answer questions about the menu and make recommendations, too. We'll keep coming back if the staff here keeps being so awesome and the quality of food remains so good. Thanks, Del Taco!!
