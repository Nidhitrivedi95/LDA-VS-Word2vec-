6XpqswYWoSOx0a9MkosVRA My wife had the shrimp tacos and I had the carne asada tacos. Both were excellent. The guacamole was ok but the salsa was very tasty. We are outdoors which was lacking a bit in atmosphere but we wanted to be outside. The inside of the place looked great. Service was efficient and appropriate.
