WpJYt8aA60xL_U8x3JbASA Probably one of the two best fast-food burrito places in town. It's either this or fat bastards (which is across the street).

Their halibut burrito is highly recommended, and it's all i have now after trying their other proteins.

Their XXX hot is really hot, so be careful when ordering.
