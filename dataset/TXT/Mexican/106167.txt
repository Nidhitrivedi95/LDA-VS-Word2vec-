fK1oj0dk9Bc6KsBk5mMDxg Great ambient, food is ok
Staff are very nice. Make sure you know the price for pitchers before ordering it
The menu is miss leading 
We got one sangria pitcher and thought its 12 dollars but it was 60 dollars 
More than half of the pitcher were filled with ice
So very expensive ice
I personally wont go back
