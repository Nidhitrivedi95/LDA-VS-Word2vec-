Hungry, tired and hot, my fam. and I visited your anthem restaurant. We went inside to place an order so we could take a load off from our long drive. We were the only ones in the place so immediately we walked to the front of the line to order. I stood there for 10 min while they ignored my presence scrambling to get 2 cars through the drive thu. The workers seemed completely out of it, and understaffed. At that point we should have left but we were already there. I decided to order the easiest thing on the menu which was the 8.99 meal deal, consisting of 4 tacos and 4 bean burritos with an added small french fry, and strawberry shake. The girl couldn't get my order down to save her life and kept switching from one register to the next. So I finally give her my order, pay and then after the fact she tells me the shake machines were down! Bummed, she hands me back my change. 
 We gather outside, were waiting on our food for 15 min. Meanwhile, the tables were filthy, two of the employees huddled in front of a overflown, wind blown trash can to have a smoke. The bathroom was just as filthy. We go back inside to check up on things , they are still working on getting the 2nd car through the drive thru. We finally get our food, 5 lonely fries in a bag and no milkshake! The meal deal was barely edible, stone cold beans, dried up taco meat,  hungry though we choked down what we could in dissillusionment . 

We definitely took a load off the next day,  laxatives anyone? 

Thank you for your time and consideration.
