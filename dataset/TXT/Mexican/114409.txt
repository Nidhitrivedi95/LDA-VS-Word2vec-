GGecutXeoEVlYKoxVo2WPA We go here for breakfast or lunch every couple of months. It opens pretty early, so that's a plus. Food isn't the best in the valley, but it's decent and priced well for amount you get. Breakfast burritos are good. Salsa bar is okay, though I find their red salsa tastes kind of like garlic powder. The others are okay. It can get a little warm inside the restaurant sometimes. Very casual with TVs towards the back, usually showing sports.

Counter service. Self-serve soft-drinks and self-serve chips if you dine in. I haven't encountered any rude people like in other reviews. Service at register has been fine for us. A-OK.
