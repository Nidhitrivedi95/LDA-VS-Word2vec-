0AQnRQw34IQW9-1gJkYnMA Came in on a busy Sunday, waitress was nice but was extremely busy, we sat down got our appetizer within the first 20 min - drinks were ok- expected better thou- received our actual food an hour later- too long of a wait for just Nachos, which by the way got me really sick, the nachos were mediocre- wings were really good thou- I only give this place a 2 star because of the long wait and I never received my Jalapenos that I ordered - did not receive a refill on my soda because it was that busy- Needs a bit more staff members - I don't think I will come here again - had a really bad stomach ache after eating the nachos :(
