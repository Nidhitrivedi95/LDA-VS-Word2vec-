b8fEuQPrf383f6pzdm8-1w My wife and I were visiting for the weekend and stopped in for lunch. The host and our waitress were very nice. The drinks were great. We tried the black bean tacos and an enchilada choice. The enchiladas were bland but the tacos were awesome. Could have been served hotter, we like our food served hot.
