G7LYpILnHveyvbg3sJePPw Pretty good place when you're on a budget since everything is 5$. For the price, I have to admit that the food is more than fine. It's a good place to hang out with friends after work, grab a drink and a plate, if you don't mind sticky tables. There's usually a pretty good line up to get in so you gotta be patient.
