1-EjdZhVZFuNG6ReBS0rvQ Love the margaritas,  good chips and salsa.  I personally have only eaten the folded chicken quesadilla...love it!!  Service has always been good.  My biggest complaint, here and all restaurants, the stinky, smelly, carpeting....please rip it out and use tile!!!!  Every time upon entering here the smell just gags me,  yuck
