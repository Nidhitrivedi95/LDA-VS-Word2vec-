_iEl9sCLsvXEFHUWPvgsAg Fun place... good service, although we were looking for more of a Tapas place - Chico Malo doesn't necessarily have a menu meant for that. Service was good, we had a guy named Jared who took some pics of our group and was totally awesome with applying filters... and actually sold us on what's called "La Calavera" which is a drink for 4, by saying it's totally perfect for Instagram - ha! With regards to the food, it was good although it's not exactly traditionally prepared. The value was ok... it's location sorta implies that it'll be spendy, and I would say that that was true. I would make the recommendation... if you're in the area.
