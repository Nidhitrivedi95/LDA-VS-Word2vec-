AhPmh0NaRDbEYyhd9egzLA I have come here many times as I live right down the street and it is solely because of the food. Everyone is friendly but every time we dine here whether its busy or slower it takes forever for anything. To take our order, getting our drinks, getting our order, our check etc. I don't seem to have this problem at their other neighboring establishments just Joyride.
