3IwCop28R1_L5jMv6AkL8Q This is now our spot, it is now our third time dinning here and well each time is better and better. 
First the chips, beans, and salsa that they bring out to start are amazing! 
We usually come with a party of four or more today it was six and we decided it was great the last three times it was now time to bring my mom and dad (very picky mexicans lol) 
We ordered 2 Green smothered burritos that were perfectly seasoned and sauced. Asada quesadilla that was so dank I truly tried to finish but was so big I could only get half down. Combo plate with 2 tacos ground beef; 1 hard 1 soft they were I quote "the best seasoned ground beef tacos, I am shocked I liked them so much!". Another combo plate with chili relleno, asada enchilada, and a shrimp soft taco, you just cant go wrong with any of the food we tried. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and seasoned very well. Enchilada with asada we just had to try since they dont usally go hand in hand and were surprisingly good but the asada is still the money ticket. Relleno was great and not soggy like some places.... beware this makes for a very hot plate. Lol Our 6 person was smart he knew the portions are big so he got to try everyones. 
Over all my family was very happy with the quality of the food and service oh and my Dad said the music is legit too. Oh and my Mom said this place is so much better than all the "LINDO" places around town. Lol We will be back for the delicioso food. 
This is a must try spot!!!
