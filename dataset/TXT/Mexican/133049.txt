iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg I tried this place once in kensington market where i tried a bunch of other places as well. Seven lives is one of the best tacos  i ever had starting with the blacken mahi mahi which is a sweet succulent taste with a bit of acidity and also i had the octopus taco. I can eat these all day for 5 bucks a taco really good deal and you can tell it is fresh because they are cooking it right in front of you. Im really impressed by their tacos beats taco bell any day. I still have to try La carnita but this place for sure makes a really good taco.Also i really like thier pico de gallo i know pico de gallo is really simple but they kick it right out of the park. It is so flavourful, i can eat almost 1000 tacos. I will definitely come back here
