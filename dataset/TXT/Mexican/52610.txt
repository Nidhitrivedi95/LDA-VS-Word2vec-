9jdlzH0HjU9_Fi3D-_a6gA I'm so sad to hear that the Val Vista location closed.  We ate here weekly.  Great food.  Personal service.  We'll have to try other locations, but the team needs to know they were appreciated.  I'll miss the enchiladas and bean dip.  The machaca was amazing.  I've eaten here enough to know that the negative comments must have been from another location.  Val Vista will be missed.
