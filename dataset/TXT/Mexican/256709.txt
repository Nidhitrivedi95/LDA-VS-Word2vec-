VHaSjiRqAjrcIFpgG9VUww The staff and management at this location is horrible, and the food suffers as a result. I normally love Chipotle and have stuck with them despite the numerous issues they have had (credit card data hacking, food issues,  etc.), but after going here I think I am done.

The food was dry and a bit stale. The servers were rude and appeared bothered to have a customers show up. It wasn't just with me but with others ahead of me in the line too. 

It is too bad to see this chain go so far downhill as Chipotle once was, for me, the best 'fast food' I could buy.
