ZkUWOdBA4T7pdUhT0dkRzQ Had an awesome dinner tonight! The unique flavors of this Southern Mexico inspired cuisine really hit the spot. Bursting with flavors from the Table-side guacamole topped with cranberries, to the Carne Asada, and the sweet ending of the Mexican bread pudding! Norma our waitress of the night was very friendly, great smile, and knew the menu like a pro! Her suggestions, and the customer service will have us coming back for more. Thank you Norma - see you soon!
