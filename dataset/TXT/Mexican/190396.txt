oDxvrLYe5SiQKdJlGhheoA We've traveled all over Mexico and most of the Southwest and appreciate most
Mexican cuisine.  Our experience is that few  U.S. Mexican restaurants offer
much (or any) seafood and what is offered seldom has a freshness you find
on the Mexican coasts.  Until now.

We found Baja Joe's Cantina (Gilbert Road, Mesa)  thanks to a Groupon offer
which led us to a non-descript strip center. Two steps inside, the atmosphere is
pure Mexican neighborhood ambience with simply the best selection of seafood
we've seen in the Valley. Not only many choices, but the best preparation and fresh taste.

Ever, the manager, greets every guest and is totally enthusiastic about his
menu and his staff. He mentioned losing many regular neighborhood customers
as the economy drove them back to Mexico, but his promotions have paid off
by bringing in new customers who never would have found the restaurant
otherwise. Everyone in the restaurant when we ate there was a repeat visitor,
so that shows how great the food is. We'll be back as well.

Don't wait for a coupon. Find Baja Joe's!
