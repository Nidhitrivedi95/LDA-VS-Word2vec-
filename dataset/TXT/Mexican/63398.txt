azJAJh8oivpsU9HzlLS6EA SLOW! In the last month I have made the mistake of trying their drive through for lunch 3 times. All 3 times I it took more than ten minutes to get my food! The last time, today, it was almost 30 minutes!! I got up to the window and there was no one there, after waiting for another 30 seconds I drove off. Without even getting any lunch.
