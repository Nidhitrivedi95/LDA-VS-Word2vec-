eJPckkV1k7gn0V2awA1pzA There are lots of sushi burrito options in Las Vegas - only Soho gets it right.  This is their second outpost and arguably their best effort to date.  Not only can you get their now well known burritos, but you can also get poke bowls and teriyaki bowls!  My office is around the corner from here, and once a week I see people in the office easting food from Soho. We all love it and for good reason.  The food is fresh, tasty, well prepared, and affordable.  The people who work there are well trained, but more importantly they are hospitable and welcoming.  Try the 3 Amigos, Twin Dragon, Lion King, or Fire Cracker as rolls (with soy paper), or the Hilo, Lahaina, or North Shore Poke Bowls.  Grab a Ramune Strawberry Soda from Japan, sit back, and enjoy your meal!
