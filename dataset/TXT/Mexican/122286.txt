We were skeptical to go at first because of its location in the back of an outdated shopping plaza but were pleasantly surprised at how tasty and flavorful the food is. We split the chorizo and cheese dip, an order of ceviche, a quesadilla, and fully loaded Mexican fries. Everything was absolutely delicious and in the future, I will choose Compadres over other fancier, more expensive Mexican restaurants I've been to in Cleveland!
