Jd2NUZeVeyWi1tTNKXMt1Q We wound up at si senor after a couple places were closed that we were looking forward to. The yelp reviews were pretty good, so we stopped.  

The service was pretty good, but really slow. I don't know what they would do if they lost their rolling serving carts, seems like they all had one.  

The chips and dips came out after a short wait. They were pretty good.  The chips came with 4 dips: hatch green chile, bean dip, some kind of ranch sour cream, and the salsa.  The salsa wasn't all that great, but the other sauces made up for it. That green chile sauce was great...and hot.

We got 4 different items.  The tacos, I thought were great.  Basic tacos, hard to do badly...They were good.  My wife had a chimi, the meat was really dry but the flavor good.  A friend got a combo plate with a few different items, no complaints there.  Then there were the fajitas...no sizzling plate, not even hot. They came out warm, and the friend eating them said pretty tastless.  

After the meal they brought out sopapillas...these little pillows of fried goodness made the wait worth it.  They were pretty tasty, but the sizes varied a lot and a buddy got the small one, it made him sad.

Over all, it was pretty good, I'd say a solid 4 star.  Pretty basic Mexican food for Arizona.
