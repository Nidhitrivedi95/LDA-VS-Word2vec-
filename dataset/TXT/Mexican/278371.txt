XMrLwzmEAsfNpbKRC7vUzQ Was really excited to try this place, but my favorite thing about them was the way they pack up your take-out orders. LOL. I got wings and celery and a drink. When I went inside to pick it up, I stood their for five minutes until their bartender handed me the bag that was sitting in front of me the entire time - already paid for. Then unfortunately I drove away before I realized they hadn't given me the drink I paid for. On top of that, the wings and ranch sucked. Very disappointed.
