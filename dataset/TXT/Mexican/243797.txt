thLX_k20SPJ0KyusGTBIHw THIS PLACE IS ALL AROUND PERFECT. Where to begin... They have the BEST happy hour in the state of Arizona. From 3 - 6 p.m. (7 DAYS A WEEK!) you can get half off apps, $5 wine + sangria, $4 house margaritas, and $3 beers. Not to mention their Taco Monday special, or all day happy hour Sunday! These people are killin' the game. The vibes are so cute - you'll never want to leave, and staff is so friendly and fun! If you can't tell, I'm just very passionate about this place (lol).

The most recent time I came here, my friend and I split THE FAMOUS nachos, a quesadilla, and their mango habanero wings. Everything has such a unique flavor! Especially when you top your food with their selection of special sauces. The roasted garlic beet one (pink) tops a few of their their dishes, and is my absolute favorite! 

The nachos are simply a must try. Like, you have to get these!!! My friend had the brilliant idea of adding BBQ chicken to our quesadilla and I'm so glad that we did. It was 10/10 amazing. I'll be getting this every time from now on. As for the mango habanero wings, they weren't for me. They definitely weren't bad, but I'm not a mango person, and I don't really like things with a kick to them! If you like sweet + spicy things, you'll love them! 

To sum up my most enthusiastic review of all time, COME HERE. You will be hooked on their good prices, good food, good portions!
