RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg They started off really small with no wait, now you have to plan on waiting in line for 30-40 minutes until they take your order on a good day plus wait an additional 20min to get it... Frustrating but there's a reason why there's a line everyday now. They are the closest they get to the real thing. Not good for groups because there's not enough seating. We came here once but had someone standing waiting for tables to be cleared to save them for us lol think in and out in Hollywood blvd after the club...
