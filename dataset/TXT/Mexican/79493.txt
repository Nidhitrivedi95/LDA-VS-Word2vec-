CuP3Z3CUZrV22FytT_uZ1A I can accept that you run out of sour cream in the last hour that you're open. Maybe, I can even understand when you run out of cheese or chips. But when there are no forks or napkins because you 'ran out', and the dining room is messy, I think that maybe a manager needs to step in and evaluate why there are so many employees standing around and such long lines to wait for mediocre service and average food. I'll make the drive to another location next time.
