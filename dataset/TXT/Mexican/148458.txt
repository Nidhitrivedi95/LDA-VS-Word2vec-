jScBTQtdAt-8RshaiBEHgw Tried this place for the first time last week. The food was fantastic! Great quality, great selection, diverse and interesting...the service was also great. The chef came out at the end of our meal to ask how everything was. The ONLY reason I am giving this place 4 instead of 5 stars is because the decor and ambience inside the restaurant is wayyy off point. Not to sound dramatic, but it's to the extent where we almost don't want to go back because it was so strange and in desperate need of a cohesive and comfortable atmosphere. 
All in all, it's new and will get there. The food and service are DEFINITELY worth it.
