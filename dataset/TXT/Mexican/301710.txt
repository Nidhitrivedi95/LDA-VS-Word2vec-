zVyi1UCU8XPcULQEzioE_g Visited here for the first time as part of Savour York Region. A pre fixed lunch for $15 could not be beat.
We arrived at approx. 1:15pm on a Thursday afternoon and the place had only a few patrons. Staff immediately approached us, seated us, took a drink order and off they went. Was back in less than 5 minutes with drinks and took our order.

For $15:

Appetizer
2 of us got the Taquito. They were excellent. Cooked perfectly and tasted wonderful.
1 person ordered the soup. Loved it, raved about it, linked the bowl clean.

Lunch Main Course
1 person ordered the burrito. When the waiter came to check on it and asked her how it was...she told him to let the chef know that she wanted to marry him. He laughed back that "he" was a "she" and our friend said if she cooks like this, it didn't matter to her. I guess it was good.
2 of us ordered the Chicken Enchiladas with Mexican rice. They were excellent, stuffed full of chicken and smothered in cheese. The rice was flavourful and cooked to perfection

Dessert
We all had the deep fried pasty covered in sugar and cinnamon. It was heaven on a plate.

When we left we all agreed that we'd be back. It was great. Food was excellent, staff friendly.
