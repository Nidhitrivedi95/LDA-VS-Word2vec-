BdzJQypceJ5Bam2P7egoiw Believe me when I say that I so wanted to love this place. :( Down the street from where I work, I hate the drive to Soho down Sahara -- so I was thrilled to see this place open literally 0.2 miles away! But sad to say, with the recent supersaturated trend of sushi burrito/bowls within the past year in this town, this place lacks... something. 

The venue is easily accessible on Rainbow, has a lot of seating and has extremely nice employees! And while I do believe that is a very important part of opening a restaurant (and that's where my two stars come from), the food plays a big factor too obviously. I have ordered from here twice (once a poke bowl, another time a sushi burrito)... and it just didn't do it for me.

COMPLAINTS:
- Their portions need to be a little bigger (I felt like my burrito did not hold shape and was a little floppy, making it very difficult and not to mention messy to eat).
- Their tempura is not made fresh (shrimp tempura and soft shell crab tempura did not have that crunch I expected, instead was soggy).
- Their sauces need a little more oomph (They say the sauce is boss... this is an important part of the meal as it adds flavor to the whole thing, and it just didn't have that kick.)

I believe this place maybe opened when they just weren't ready. But it's all a learning experience though, right? The sushi burrito/bowl craze is hot right now and they just need to get it together a little. I will definitely give this place another try, especially due to the fact is so close to my work and convenient... but honestly, it is not something I would go out of my way for at this current time. #StrikeTwo :P
