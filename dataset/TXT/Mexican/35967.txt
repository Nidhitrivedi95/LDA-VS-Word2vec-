5G-i1t7VXLGByswnCKvrDQ I will not go back. At the end of the meal i explained to the manager at first my food was wrong then my taco had a whole bay leaf inside it i almost choked on..he said they cook with them so i said i understand but they are not supposed to be served whole to people in there food. He proceeded to argue with me then the cook brought a bowl of soup out and garnished it with a bay leaf and said "see" i was done talking bay leaves are not really edible they wont harm you but youll have a hell of a time trying to eat one... so i will never go back since thats what they offer and think thats ok to serve to people
