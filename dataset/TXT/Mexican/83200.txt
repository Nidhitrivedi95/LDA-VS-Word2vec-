D3MfMrIoNV4_aXPj0bi1BQ Food - delicious.  They start you off, like all Mexican restaurants, with chips and salsa. They kept filling ours too, and the salsa was fresh and tasty.  To add to our appetizer, I got the guacamole and it was superb. You could taste the fresh, high quality avocados in it.  I also got the veggie chile relleno.  Best I've ever had (not that I've had that many). It came out hot and crispy, impressively portioned, served with a side of various pickled vegetables (if you like pickles, like I do, go here). 

The service was okay but was not that great. We didn't wait long for anything, but we were not blown away by our server.  She seemed kind of cold towards us, but she did the job. 

As far as the price goes, it's more than you would pay at Chi-Chis, but I feel it's worth it. You get higher quality food and large portions.  

The beer list was great. Their tequila selection was awesome and helped to soothe my stomach from a rough night before. 

Lopez on Lee - you (almost) complete me.
