7GGJlp1aWfcXGQz6q7SkXQ Groupon goodness gave me open bar. Drinking one's face off in Vegas at least once is recommended by 10/10 doctors.

Justin was awesome. Pouring for a full bar and worshipping me isn't easy, especially when busy. Unfortunately, the woman at the other bar near the entrance was very slow and took more than 5 minutes AFTER finishing a drink to make it back around to ask if I wanted another. This was the case for each drink I had. Suppose I shouldn't have tipped her in advance for them. 

The food was pretty good, there are a ton of games such as beer pong, pool, shuffleboard etc, and the music and atmosphere are decent.
