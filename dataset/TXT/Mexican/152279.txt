JXiOlujB1i7aZvkNJ9xpzQ OMG. We have been searching for real Mexican food since moving back here from Houston 2 years ago. We had all but given up until we found this hidden gem!  We feel like we are back in Texas. Service was prompt and friendly and the food was stellar!  Skinny margarita was fantastic. Guacamole and queso just like we remembered. Will be back tomorrow and frequently. So very glad we found this place. Salsa and chips are sooooo good I don't have room for my dinner. Portions are generous. Angleica was so great and helpful!!
