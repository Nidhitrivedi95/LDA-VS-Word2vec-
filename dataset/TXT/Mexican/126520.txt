Hv2BwfsNSsUanW2pJ-VCRA I am so happy that I have a Don Tortaco a quarter of a mile away, especially since Robertos are everywhere and The Don is hands down much cleaner, about 1000% less greasy, and they offer delicious desserts too. This is my last minute meal headquarters and they almost always deliver quality taco shop food. One star demerit for being one of the only taco shops I have ever seen that closes at 10pm.
