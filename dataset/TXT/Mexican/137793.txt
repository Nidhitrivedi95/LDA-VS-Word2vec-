Iu2ZINWwyrt9gXliykBEKQ I'm also surprised at how negative the reviews are here.  I went last weekend with a friend and we both enjoyed this restaurant.  It certainly isn't perfect but it's worth checking out.
The food was good.  It's not great and I'm not sure if it is authentic mexican but I was reasonably happy with my meal (though as others have posted, the guac is a little bland).  My friend was quite happy with her enchiladas as well. 
The service was fantastic.  Our waitress was very attentive and answered all of our questions about individual dishes (and I was having a rather indecisive night so there were many questions).  She also offered us a less expensive half order option when we tried to order a dish that would have been much too large for the two of us as a starter.
We had margeritas with our dinner and, while pricey, the cucumber margerita was an absolutely fantastic concoction which I will certainly be returning for when I need a treat.
