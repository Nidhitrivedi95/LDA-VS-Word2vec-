qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A I really enjoyed their food. I got slow cooked pork over rice and it was pretty good. Pork was really soft. I wish it was a bit more flavorful but good enough! Price was pretty decent too. Fried chicken and waffle wasn't that great though :/ I've had better ones.

What I found funny was that, on the weekend brunch, all you can drink mimosa cost $20... and food costed much less than that.
