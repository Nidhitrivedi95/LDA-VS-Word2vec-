UJb1PrUWDFfuzwUPc1pP4Q Today I watched as two of El  Hefe's staff members explicitly denied service to a black man for wearing basketball shoes. Their justification was that those shoes are used to "fight". Terribly disappointed by their inherently racially charged and biased policy as they allowed almost every other person with athletic style shoes through and refused to allow service to my friend. We tried talking to the staff and they simply dismissed our concerns. I urge you to reconsider your approach and training of your staff members in regard to safety precautions and respect for diversity and equity in our community.
