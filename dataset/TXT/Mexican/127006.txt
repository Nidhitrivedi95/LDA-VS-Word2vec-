hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg You've heard the rumors, and they're all true.  It's near impossible to get a reservation here, and you have to be fairly violent to snag any of the first-come-first-served tables right when they open.  Your best bet is to abandon your family and come here alone to get one of the few spots at the bar.  Tell your family you're not feeling well, and that you're going to just get room service, and politely suggest they take their time eating at...wherever they're going to eat...and then sneak out and enjoy an experience you can never tell them about.

It was easier for me because I was traveling solo for work, which is another convenient way to get a spot.  The host was very nice, and the bartender was super friendly, not only providing fantastic service, but also adding the right amount of interaction without being too distant nor chatty.  He also provided some great wine recommendations and got all of us solo bar patrons to chat with one another.

I know what you're thinking.  Shut up, Mike, I'm hungry and all of this reading is costing me on the expensive Canadian data plan that I purchased at the airport.  Fine.

I had a pretty incredible plate of beef short ribs that were perfectly marinated and fall-off-the-bone tender.  But anything you get here will be prettttttty great.

Don't plan to go out after eating here.  Embrace the wonderful, wonderful food coma.
