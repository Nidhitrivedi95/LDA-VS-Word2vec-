My 3 amigos margarita was delicious and worth the price because the coronita keeps on giving, like two drinks in one. I didn't take a picture of my tacos de pollo (chicken tacos) $13.29, but they were delicious and I do recommend them. Queso Laredo (appetizer) was good but nothing to rave about. Just some nacho cheese and ground beef, top with pico. I enjoyed my time here.
