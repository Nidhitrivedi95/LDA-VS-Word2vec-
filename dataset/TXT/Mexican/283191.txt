XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Delicious ! We had the queso with blue corn chips, apple salad and green chili burger (with fresh cut jalapeño on our request) and it was pure pleasure. The salad was a brilliant mix of salty, spicey, sweet, crunchy and fresh. The burger was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth. Staff was fantastic. Only downside was actually getting to the place itself bc it's buried inside Cesar's near the forum shop entrance. Well worth the hunt though...
