fwDx6uoM2SWtddARwAds2g Went here tonight for Winterlicious and it was a very disappointing experience. The ceviche app was served with some dried up chips not even some nachos which would have been more appropriate and easier to actually scoop. My boyfriends chicken was undercooked and so was my squid ink octopus. We kept getting interrupted and they were so eager to do a table turnover that they kept trying to clear our plates. Not once did our server come to check up on us or ask how everything was. The wait for our dessert was also very long not sure if she forgot to pick it up but even the desserts were not good, I especially went to try the churros but they were too dry for my liking and my boyfriends dessert was tiny and tasteless. Sorry not even worth a $35 winterlicious menu. Our server didn't seem very pleased to be working and was very unfriendly. We also noticed that we got charged $1 more on all our beers then what was written in the menu, we didn't say anything we just replaced it with her tip. Me and my boyfriend both work in the food industry and we were absolutely shocked at how bad the service was and how the food did not match at all Mexican cuisine.
