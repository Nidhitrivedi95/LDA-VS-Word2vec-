_XN-GwzZwAyIqLKJsl2htg This place is a great spot for good tacos and sushi! First, we ordered the tacos for happy hour (4 for$7). Those were delicious! Then we ordered Salmon Avocado Roll that was very good! The Pork "Al Pastor," were my favorite. I suggest you try them. The service and time for everything was good and perfect! Then for dessert was the salted  caramel ice cream and a chocolate cake! Best Place in Scottsdale! I rate 5/5.
