fbQaKW0Lte0JQ_opbnjdKg first off, this is not a very healthy place to eat. now that that has been said, the workers here are just so great! they all greeted me and every customer in front of me. they were thorough in explaining the menu to me which i appreciated on my first visit. the food was quite delicious as well, altho definitely not healthy and quite heavy actually. i felt a major food coma after what i thought would be a somewhat healthy meal. i ordered my enchiladas without cheese and sauce on the side but their mashed potatoes had a lot of butter in them. also, the ambience of the place was quite comfortable for a fast food joint. it had a nice open view of the street and parking lot and brought in a lot of natural sunlight which i really liked. the only issued i had with the place was there was a girl worker there who shouted at everyone. maybe she was hard of hearing, but it really got on my nerves spending 30 minutes there trying to enjoy my meal when she was talking so uncontrollably loud. the manager was behind her at one point and never said a thing. the workers must have gotten used to her loud mouth. overall, i would come back here again.
