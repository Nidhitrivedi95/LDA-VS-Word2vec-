GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog This place was so good! It's tapas, so everything is small plate, but everything we tried was absolutely delicious. Tableside guacamole was amazing, lamb dumplings were my husband's favorite. I tried the black bean tacos and salad with Hawaiian palm hearts. I'm experimenting with a vegan diet and this place was more than accommodating and had plenty of options. Definitely on the pricey side, but being that it was in Vegas, the food was excellent, and the service was exceptional, we felt it was worth it. Definitely check it out!
