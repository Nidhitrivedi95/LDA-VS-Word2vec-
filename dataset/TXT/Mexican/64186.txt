B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA We came here because there was a long wait at the Oyster Bar.  That was a good move on our part.  This place is a fast food restaurant, which means that you order at the counter, they prepare it for you, you pay and find a table.  

The food here is very good.  They have many options, including vegetarian!  Price was reasonable for what you get.  Definitely budget friendly.  Service was great and staff were friendly.  And, they had Sapporo for $3!  Now, you can't beat that deal.  

Would I come back here again?  You bet!
