lOmt6Edj6A4OZBUIUwtI8Q Had been looking up good Mexican places  to try and found this on Yelp. Figured I couldn't go wrong since there are a lot of good reviews on this place. Ordered a chicken burrito and it was really bland. The chicken had no seasoning and the rice smelled and tasted old. They weren't busy and had no other customers besides me, so there is no excuse as to why it couldn't have been a tasty burrito. Maybe the other menu items are good? But I definitely won't be coming here again. I may check out the Puerto Rican place that is in the same food court, hopefully they'll be better.
