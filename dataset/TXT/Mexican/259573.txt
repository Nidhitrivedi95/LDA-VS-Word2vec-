Voeq7aGDmCGMjE_SQiHwRA It doesn't matter how tasty the tacos are, how delicious the salsa is, how satisfying the drinks are, and how good the prices are if the STAFF SUCKS. Yes, dear manager and owner, that is enough to ruin any establishment. The waitress, Rachel, was unfriendly and rude until my gay friend showed up who she must have liked because then her attitude completely changed. So sorry if we weren't ready to order drinks and food the minute we sat down. And, whoever the absolutely rude hostess was everyone else made kick us out is completely unacceptable. I too am in the service industry and promise you being friendly with a group is going to get you way farther than being rude. Sure your line- "we have another party for this table, like now" said in the bitchiest possible tone is one way to get a party out but trying something like, "I'm sorry we have another party that's been waiting 30 minutes for this table" might be a better approach. I promise you my friends and I will never return and will certainly recommend one of your competitors (Tako or Condado) rather than ever steer anyone to this establishment. So, staff of the Bakersfield, work on your attitude or find a job where interacting and communicating with other people is not critical to the job. I also realize this is a chain and no one will likely care about this review, but with two other nearby competitors of the exact same nature, I urge you not to go here. 

4/10: A follow-up to my review from Friday, 4/7. The manager, Charles, is outstanding and takes the customer experience seriously. I honestly expected no one to care much about my Yelp review but he reached out to me immediately to apologize. I will definitely give the Bakersfield another try as the food, drinks, and vibe were great and it is obvious from the manager's concern and follow-up with me that my experience is not the norm.
