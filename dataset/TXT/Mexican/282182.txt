XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Best piece of advice for dining at Mesa Grill: Order something non-bread related and non-carbalicious. After downing the uber amazing bread basket that is served pre-meal, you'll wish you had.

First of all, the bread basket was the best bread basket I've ever been served. It consisted of blue corn muffins, jalapeno corn bread, blueberry coffee cake, mini scones, and the most perfectly softened butter that you ever did see. I had to try halfs of each type of bread, and they were all perfectly warm bunches of little goodness.

I think the restaurant is a great brunch spot (which is the meal that we were dining here for). The menu consisted of a little bit of everything for all breakfast/lunch palettes. I chose to go with the scrambeled eggs chilaquiles for my main course. Boy, it was heavy, rich, and just superb! The flavors blended perfectly well with the eggs, the fried tortilla on the bottom, the cheese, and the creme fraiche topping. The roasted tomatillo sauce could've had a bit more heat to it, but nonetheless, it was still a great compliment to the dish.

I also tried bits of my friend's dishes. The tomato soup with blue corn tortillas was actually surprisingly good (given that I'm not much of a tomato fan). The blue corn buttermilk waffle was heavenly. A bit too much creme fraiche was piled on top, but once removed, the waffle was crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and just a melt in your mouth piece of heaven.

This is the second Bobby Flay restaurant I've tried (Bar Americain being the first), and he does not continue to disappoint. Really amazing food! I'd recommend this place to everyone!
