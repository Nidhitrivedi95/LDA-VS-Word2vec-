vqEtZ7CtNB9G8WMzjwJA2g I thought this was a restaurant but it's more like a little bar tucked away in Downtown.  It's not amazing.. but I also live in California now so I have ample access to great Mexican food which is cheaper than this.

Still.. it was pleasant.  The waitstaff was nice.  There were a ton of girls here for some reason the night I was there.

I did not try their margaritas even though it was a $5 special.  I find that sometimes the well drinks at tequila places aren't that good anyways.

So I tried their tortilla soup.  A bit dissapointing for a Mexican restaurant.  My favorite one was at Grove Tavern.  Then I tried their carne asada.  Large in portion.. ehhh.. it was just okay.  It seemed a little dry to be honest.  It's kind of weird that I remember El Toro being so much better.  But maybe it's because I was a college student back then.  

Anyways, not too much seating area so I can't imagine getting a seat on a busy weekend night.  As for upscale.. ehhhh.. I don't know.. beside it being in downtown, I'm not sure about that.
