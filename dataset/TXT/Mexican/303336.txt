zZHKHyz079fgX3sMskDKSg Tried the fish tacos and it was the best I have had outside of Mexico

Would definitely return to try again

The other with me tried the short rib taco and was not as impressed as I was 

From my personal experience I would have gave them a five but docked them a point for disappointing on others meal
