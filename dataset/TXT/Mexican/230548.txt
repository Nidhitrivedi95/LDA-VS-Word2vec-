sh69ApUyPhAltAMpv5vX3w One of the sexiest most delicious meals I've ever had. Tasting menu was delectable, the staff was as lovely and delicious as the food.
Rather than do the wine pairing, we asked for a premium silver tasting menu of tequila.
Barrio Café has never disappointed, and this restaurant is so charming and perfect in every way, that I find myself having a crush on the chef just because she such an EPIC bad ass. 
I have friends coming in from all over the country, as we are in a food lovers group. We all cook and feel as if we do relatively well in our own right. 
This restaurant is a dessert to people like me, where food means more than just filling my stomach. 
Sexy love affair. 
Brava!!!
