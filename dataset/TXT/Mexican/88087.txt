DMmeFKsUuMl0kDy7Zd7W3A This was the first time we have been here.  The atmosphere is great and beachy.  My wife had the sampler platter - nachos, mini-chimis and quesadillas.  Everything was pretty good.  I had the (not) hot wings.  They were done with a dry rub, I wasn't expecting that.  I like a more traditional sauce.  They were grilled which I did like and they were huge which was a bonus.  They were, however, very salty, at least to me and my wife.  The other people that we were with had the fajitas and tacos.  They said both were delicious.  Service was very slow with the drinks and refills.
