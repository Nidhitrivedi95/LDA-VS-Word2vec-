0fyxLMASE5bfYAgW6MYM_g We moved to Peoria last year and were looking for a good Mexican sit down restaurant.  We have tried this place 3 times so far, and I am underwhelmed. I transferred to San Diego for two years for work, and there is no shortage of good Mexican food there, so I wanted to give this place a chance by making multiple visits.  On previous visits I considered their food ok.  Not bad but not super good and the service was acceptable.

On our last visit about 2 weeks ago, we went in for a late dinner on a Monday night.  We decided to sit on the patio  After waiting for about 7 minutes (from when I started timing), we still were not greeted.  There were two seats open at the bar, so we moved inside.  It took the bartender a bit to greet us, but eventually we ordered some wine and the fajitas.  We also asked for some pico de gallo for our chips at the same time.  I thought the food took a little long to get there, but a horrible wait.  The bartender disappeared for quite a while, and when we next saw her she was bringing us our food.  Still no pico de gallo, and when I asked her expression made it clear that she had forgotten. 

The topper was that the fajitas were not good.  The chicken was dry and flavorful, and the veggies were soggy. Honestly, I've had much better fajitas at Chili's.  It's sad because this place is literally around the corner from our house,  however when you couple this experience with the fact their wine select consists of "house" wines, I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.
