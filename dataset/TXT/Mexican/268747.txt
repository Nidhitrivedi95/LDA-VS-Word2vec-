WNXO0rPugvgE5ljccYL7MQ I got the carne asada fries and my wife got the street tacos. Both were good. The horchata was the best I think I have had anywhere. But the service was the best. We ordered a kids meal for my boy and couldn't decide between fries and beans and rice.  We decided on beans and rice, but they brought both. The owner also brought out crayons and paper for us, along with two quarters. My son wanted a toy out of the machines, but we had no quarters. He heard and brought it without even being asked. I just moved here and they just got one dedicated family.
