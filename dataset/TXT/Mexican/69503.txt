BQJokxJ4y4s57i7Mn65pvA I came here about two weeks ago. The food is a little pricey but what do you expect you're in Vegas. Anyways the restaurant didn't open till 4:30. So my husband and I sat at the bar and waited into it open. I believe the bartenders name was Sergio. He made me and my husband the best Cadillac ever. We finally got seated and all the staff members were super nice and friendly. Our waiter was super cool and friendly and knew his stuff. The food was legit and tasted good. I would definitely come back to this place when I go back to Vegas. But just be prepare to spend some money because it's not cheap.
