h4Q-uSoOIhMoIsOhat6l3A The restaurant is much bigger than it looks from the outside. 
The service is very attentive... There is a lot of staff available. 

My friends and I ordered our food and an appetizer. The appetizer never came out, but the food was very good. 

They have good chips and salsa... My favorite thing to order at most restaurants and bars... theirs is very good. 

Pricing is competitive and inline with what you would expect to pay. Thankfully, it wasn't very fancy... It was traditional Mexican that most would expect. 

Will definitely go back... check them out!
