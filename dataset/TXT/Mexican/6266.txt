_FXa_6j-6UDsxWo-KX7WvQ This is probably one of my most favorite Mexican food restaurants in the area, mostly because it is New Mexican, which is awesome! I lived in New Mexico as a child and finding this place as an adult has been a real treat. I absolutely love the green chile, and the red is also very tasty. My favorite is the Chimichanga with green sauce, but the  fry breads and the breakfast are amazing too.
