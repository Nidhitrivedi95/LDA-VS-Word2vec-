FoKx_RP4kUM-aiGo3wlUUw I order take out from here for lunch occasionally and I'm never disappointed: the food is always good. Plus, you get free chips, salsa, and bean dip with every order! They had quick service when I have eaten in the restaurant as well, so this is a great lunch spot during the work week!
