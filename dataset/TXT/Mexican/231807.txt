Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg Loved the bean dip as a starter. Chips were nice and thick. The service was outstanding. Especially the one in charge of filling the drinks and chips. He rocked! I had the steak fajitas, the tortillas were large, authentic, and durable. Others at the table had flautas, chimichangas, and the shrimp diabola. All were happy with the meals.  Great Mexican spot.
