Or7FgbgY8ML30zgYj_DCwA We have visited Made in Mexico many times since it opened its doors, first at a smaller location across the street from where they are currently located. Service is friendly and the food is good. We especially love the guacamole with its spicy sauces but I would like more tomatoes and onions in the guac. I have had quesadillas, alambres, tacos and enchiladas. Sometimes, I find when I think I am trying something new, that one dish quite resembles or tastes like another. The way celebrate birthdays always makes me smile - they are so enthusiastic and the song is so lively that you also want to sing along.
