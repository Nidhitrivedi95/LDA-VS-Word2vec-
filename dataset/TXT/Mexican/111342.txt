g-E12y45gBKedax5N20YmQ You had me at $.99 tacos! 

So I've literally driven by this place hundreds of times and always say I'm going to give them and try...and it just never worked out. Until a few weeks ago when my coworkers and I gave them a try for Taco Tuesday. I mean $.99 tacos....always count me in! 

When we arrived it was a long line, which is always a good sign. I tried three tacos: a steak, spicy chicken and beef. They were all yummy. There were plenty of toppings to add and they all come with chips and salsa. 

You can't ask for a better lunch deal. It's fast, cheap and yummy!
