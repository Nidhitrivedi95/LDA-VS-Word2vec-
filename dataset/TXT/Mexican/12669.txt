0FH5h58Qls1VIuXh5QORlg The food at El Sol is really good. We normally get the mixed platter for 2and there is always enough food that my wife and I both leave full.

As most other people have commented the problem with the restaurant is that the service is VERY slow, so slow in fact that when mentioned El Sol last night my wife refused to go because she can't bear to wait.

I give it high marks for food quality/quantity but the wait will definitely push the boundaries of even the most patient diners.

I will return with friends or when my wife is not that hungry.
