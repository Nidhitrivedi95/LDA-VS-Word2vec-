bQ2uuNkOxgUQRM7Y7RJDXQ As with all my reviews they are based on several visits mostly over years.  I hate reviews where a person had a bad experience and a negative review follows.  I will never leave a review of a restaurant I visit only once.  My family has been going here since it opened and for the first year it was really one of our top Mexican food places.  Something changed and all aspects from quality/consistency of food to poorer service every time we go has just been on a downward trend.  This of course means from visiting twice a month to now once every few months reflects of course on their bottom line.  We were short of time last night and in the area so we went in.  6:50pm on a Wednesday.  The place was only 1/3 full and we waited for a hostess behind a group of five.  We all waited and watched a teen male employee have a tad inappropriate conversation on the companies phone right beside the hostess stand.  A hostess showed up and had some employees move from a larger table right by the kitchen to seat the party of five.  We were finally next.  The hostess told us the wait would be 25 min at which point I looked around at how empty the place was and several employees just fooling around doing nothing and figured they must of had several reservations.  We waited.  Apparently not one reservation was for 7pm because at 7:10pm every empty seat was still empty.  We know most of the managers and it seemed none we there.  I had enough and we left.  The final straw of course was this last visit but it's been a year long progression of simple poor restaurant management.  To bad, we really once liked it here.  I guess the good thing is there is no shortage of fine Mexican food in the area to take their lost business.
