Ks9nrEuLdjmrLH9uXz_G8A Realistically, a Chipotle- is a Chipotle - is a Chipotle. It's a chain that makes glorified burritos; So, food wise, you'll get the same taste no matter the location you go to. What sets this location apart is the fantastic customer service! 

Hats off to the team here, they always give the customer what the customer wants. There's always clean tables. The bathrooms are cleaned regularly. Everyone is polished, and friendly. Above all else, the line at this location moves especially quick! That's the reason I go to Chipotle in the first place, I consider it fast food - so FAST is how I'd prefer it. - They're not shy with the Guacamole either, THANK GOD because it's up to $1.90 now! 

Definitely a fan of this location!
