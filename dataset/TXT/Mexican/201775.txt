plHKBwA18aWeP-TG8DC96Q While it's been over a year since they shut their Homestead location, the owners have obviously not been idle. Their new location in Lawernceville is very cool with a wooden and rustic interior. When I visited, they were piping in some old school rap that made for a fun brunch atmosphere. We got the Mac and cheese and queso to start. The Mac and cheese was good but didn't stand out as a signature dish. The queso was very flavorful and the homemade chips added to the dish. The breakfast tacos were well flavored and had a nice punch to them. We will defiantly be back.
