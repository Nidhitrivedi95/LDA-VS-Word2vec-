4UmjnX46qbhV6-D5W89IOQ Let's start off by saying I wouldn't even give this place any stars. Can there last night and I understood the drive through is backed up. Came inside and ordered was I told that wait time to get my food is 10 mins. That's unheard off.!!! Anyhow, I placed an order and after 5 mins I decided to get my refund back. Im not sure how they hire the employees but my receipt clearly says what I payed for. The guy ended up refunding me back a different amount than what I payed for. Clearly he didn't have any math skills at all and I demanded to get back what I payed for! Worst Taco Bell service ever!!!
