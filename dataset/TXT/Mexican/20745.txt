I gave this place a one star because even though the servers were friendly and knowledgeable the manager and (seemed to be owner) were awful to the staff. I witnessed them yelling at my server (who identified to us that it was her first day flying solo)-- she was nearly in tears! The manager and owner need to get their attitudes together before displaying them infront of customers. 

Again--- great margaritas!
