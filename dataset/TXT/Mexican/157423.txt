KLvpdtFYUi1I0LNsmIqeJw Disgusting.... I'm from chicago and this was the worst food I have ever eaten. The Mongolian beef was sweet with a strong starchy / Pasty taste. I was horrible. The egg fu young was basically a omelette on top of gravy. The chicken was over cooked there were 4 super dry. They had the appearance of being very dehydrated. We spent $88.00 on garbage. BE WARE ITS A WASTE OF MONEY
