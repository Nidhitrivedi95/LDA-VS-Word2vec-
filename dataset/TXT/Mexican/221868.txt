rp1TgQObnIIRZw3fHWSwJA I was there about a year ago. Had a glorious beef chimichanga. The food was great, but my only complaint was the service. Now, maybe it was just because we were on the patio, but we waited at least 30-45 mins to get drink orders taken. It seems our waitress may have just left mid-meal also, so we had to keep asking various people for our checks by the end of it. Good food, but I wouldn't go back.

Oh! I almost forgot to mention: one of the most disgusting bathrooms I have ever seen. There was uh, "stuff" everywhere. Pretty nasty.
