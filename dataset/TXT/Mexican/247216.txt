txsL_YPn8-JtpkYjtXq9mQ I give five stars because the food at this location is fresh and the service is great - their Carne Asada diced steak is fresh and tender and Beef Enchiladas is very tasty. Side dishes are also great. 
The drive through takes a reasonable time , about ten minutes for two orders.  You can be sure that your meal was made to order and was prepared specifically for you.
