FI-8LPGkc8D_hwx0l0zyyg We stopped for lunch at this venue of Blanco's yesterday, as we had a good experience at their Sky Harbor airport venue.  We ordered the green chili pork enchilada and a trio of tacos:  crispy shrimp,  fish and carne asada.  We started with an appetizer of of street corn.  All complemented by their classic margarita. The chips and salsa that comes to the table when seated were really quite good, and the margaritas and street corn were excellent.  Of the main dishes, only the crispy shrimp was excellent.  The carne asada was OK, but the fish was very fishy and unpleasant.  Their pork enchilada was a layered version in a pan, and it was tasty, but not particularly outstanding.
