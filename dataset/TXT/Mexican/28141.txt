We ordered using grub hub about an hour and a half ago. We are still waiting to see if this pig slop shows up. Their phone number obviously goes to some pay phone in Mesa. No one answers it and it goes to voicemail. You'd think if you enjoyed being in the food business, you wouldn't dick over customers. If the trash ever even shows up, ill probably end up driving back to the dumpster restaurant and throwing it all over their floor.
