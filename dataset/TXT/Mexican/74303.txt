cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A This place is effin' amazing. I love it. I could eat the Red Jade Chicken and Emerald Chicken, all day, everyday. It's delicious. Chino is unique and full of flavor. The place is ALWAYS BUSY! 

P.s. it's not the cleanest joint (in regards to the tables/floors being 100% wiped down) but for a hole in the wall Chinese-Mexican joint it is WORTH IT!
