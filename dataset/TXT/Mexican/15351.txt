15LVDu1_v97JEx-g97wnfA It's taken me so long to write this review because I'm not sure I can find the words.  I've been in Madison for about 10 years now and have eaten so many places, and Sal's is, without a doubt, the best there is.  This is why my boyfriend and I have been upwards of 50 times and we try to make it once every week or two.  Before Sal's, I never considered myself a pizza fanatic.  But what Sal's does is so beyond what I used to know of pizza.  Every component is perfect.  The chewy yet crispy crust, the heavenly tomato sauce, and the host of perfectly balanced creative ingredients make every bite an experience you'll never want to end.  Eating here is like floating on a fresh mozzarella cloud in pizza heaven and it's raining state-of-the-art pepperoni.  Just, I'll stop being weird and just go here.  Also, when you go, don't limit yourself to pizza.  The appetizers and specials are phenomenal as well.  This chef knows what's up and these people can cook!  But in case you're wondering, the Forza is our favorite.
