7GGJlp1aWfcXGQz6q7SkXQ All I know is we stumbled across this after going the long way through the Venetian this past Friday. We were about to turn around before a waitress said come in we have $1 drinks for the ladies. I'm like ok.. even if the drinks are high, it will be like 2 for 1. We get in and the DJ was rocking!!! They also had $50 all day open bar for me!!! I'm like this is a win win. We danced the night away and our bartender was fantastic. I never went without a drink
