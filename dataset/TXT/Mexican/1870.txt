Anyway, the waiter was nice and attentive, but the service was slow.  I would expect more since you know the bean and the rice are ready and enchiladas are really not that hard to make.
Again, for what I expected in Phoenix, this was not that good.
Come here only if you don't feel like driving or walking in the heat.
