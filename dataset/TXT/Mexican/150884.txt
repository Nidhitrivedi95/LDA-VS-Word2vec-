Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ To start with the bright side, the service was very good. Our waiter took the time to let me sample all the drinks at the front and then mixed two flavors. 

The food was pretty awful. The food was cold and very average for the price. I ordered an appetizer and it was 12.00 plus very cold. When I asked the other people everyone else had a complaint about the food too.
