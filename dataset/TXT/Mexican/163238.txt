LE94B7yvaxh0l_wh_yEpjg Went to Agave yesterday with 2 friends. 

The restaurant is small and on two levels, with most seating upstairs. Place was very dimly lit. Would be a great date spot or fun for a small group.

The server was great - friendly and well-informed on the menu choices and ingredients. 

The menu is meant to be tapas style but we each ordered 2 dishes which seemed to work out well in terms of portions. Dishes were priced between $7-$13 for the most part with a few $4 side dishes available.

I had a poblano pepper, which was stuffed with guacamole. It was huge and delicious and just the right amount of spiciness. 

I also tried the tostada, you can't go wrong here. Lots of flavours.

Friends tried the flank steak salad, a mole chicken of some sort and the chileajo (spicy dish of vegetables and lentils). We all raved about the food.

They had a small selection (3) of cocktails available and 3 desserts too. The margaritas went down very well.

Super excellent.
