IMb5BpDLlSbr7yn19HhltA We keep trying to give this spot a chance but now we are DONE trying and will never eat here again. Our waitress constantly has attitude with other employees and customers. (Not the first time this has happened) the table next to us complained about cold food and beans that were not warmed up and she re made the dish for the lady. When our food came out (while waiting for a refill for over 10 minutes) our beans tasted horrible like someone in the kitchen purposely did something to them that wasn't normal (spit, vinegar, something metallic tasting) I'll never give this place a chance again. First time in years I haven't left at least a 20% tip. The sad thing is they don't change their staff no matter how rude these girls are. No one should scoff at you if you ask for a refill. No one should bash other customers 10 feet away where everyone can here. Blah, not coming back.
