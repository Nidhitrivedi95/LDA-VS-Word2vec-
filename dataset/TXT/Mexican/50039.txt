8Syk4yZRivDlVUdXxIPutQ I really really wanted to like this place. I read the yelp reviews before I visited. I ordered a combo plate with a Taco a Tamale and an enchilada. The food looked the part but it was so bland and unflavored.  There are way to many Mexican restaurants to have such a lack of flavor.  I think the cook needs to revamp the recipes or just add some Garlic or Salt.
