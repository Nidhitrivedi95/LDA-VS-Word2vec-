Finally made it here for dinner and I'm glad I did! The restaurant has an urban / antique feel - exposed brick, high ceiling, and colorful. There were some tables outside, a rather large bar area inside, high tops, large half moon booths, and a separate dining room. Without reservations for a busy Saturday night the wait was not bad at less than 30 minutes. 

The host and server in charge of the outside patio were enthusiastic and kind striking small talk during the wait which made me excited for my meal! Once seated our actual server seemed distracted or slammed. Between 2 of us we ordered 4 dishes (tapas) and 2 drinks and were full. Goat cheese with pumpkin seeds/spices, eggplant frites, risotto balls, potato/charizo/egg dish = all tasty. The bill came in under $40! From being indifferent prior to dining here I now wish I did sooner. Radio Maria seems to have great drink deals, happy hour, and brunch.
