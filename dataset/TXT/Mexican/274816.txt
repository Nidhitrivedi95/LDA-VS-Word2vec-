XaVHqVByyKswE0wV-B0HRg This is my absolute favorite restaurant! The food is consistently tasty and at a fair price. They have a large vegetarian selection all of which is tasty. They have the best tasting re-fried beans of anywhere else I have tried!!!! Being a vegetarian this is very important. My favorite is the Veggie fajitas but when I go with meat eaters they all rave about the Chimi aca pocco or chicken chimichanga.  It is family owned and the Brothers that own it are extremely friendly and eager to please. I have eaten there many many times and the one time I went and my dad did not enjoy his entree he informed the staff and they apologized over and over and made him something else and comped his meal. They are often adding new and different things to the menu and have a real passion for making there customers happy. I recently moved to Colorado and I am missing El Rio so much!!!! We still have not found a restaurant that even remotely compares.
