AHTgvyZf6ivK1FLCmdRbwQ I really enjoyed my chicken tacos but my carne asada was loaded with fat. It was quite disgusting. The staff is here is great and friendly. The portions are way too small. IMO I think tapas are a waste of money and 7 to 8 dollars for ONE SMALL TACO is a rip off. This place needs to come up with lower prices or it won't survive. I've called and asked if they have any lunch specials and the guy says, "everything is a special for you honey..." Umm yea ok. Don't get me wrong.... The food is good, service is great but the prices for what u are actually getting just doesn't seem worth it to me.
