d8lmIZIqmBC9oPM8y1dc7Q Ok.  The Mexican food here is fairly decent for being in North Carolina.   The reason for the 1 star is to bring attention to the lame young female bartender.  With only a few people at the bar this girl really made an effort to have terrible customer service.   Walked by several times without even looking or asking if we needed anything or how was the food etc.   I usually tip 20% but this was not the case this time.  This girl needs to wake up and take care of her customers.   It's a shame but the owner / manager needs to talk to her or fire her ASAP.
