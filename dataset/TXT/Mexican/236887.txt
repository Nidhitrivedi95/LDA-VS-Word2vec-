SW6ZQk22G1_CV81_gfnvNQ Honestly, I don't really know what all the hype is.

My first impression was holy crap this place is cooooool and I REALLY wanted the food to be good.
But, it just didn't perform.  

The 'In Cod We Trust' taco was bland.
Crispy Advocado and Bean sounded so great.  What's in a name?
The Chorizo was the best of the bunch but still blah.

And, TORTILLAS?  Why can't Toronto seem to find a good tortilla supplier - honestly these tasteless pieces of pressed maseca aren't cutting it.

The micheladas were very good though and I think they put some sort of canned pickled jalapeno juice in them, which was a very nice touch.

Other than that, a place I've heard so much about and that seemed to have so much potential just didn't wow me.

They did give a limited edition print from the graphic artist/co-owner, which was a great idea and also a nice touch.  They've really got the decor and atmosphere down but they need to revamp the kitchen.  Unfortunately, with all the other taco places that are much better (El Asador, Playa Cabana, Seven Lives) I just probably won't be burned again at La Carnita.
