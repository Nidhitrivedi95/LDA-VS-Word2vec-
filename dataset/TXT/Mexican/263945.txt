WB8BmFMORvshjb7tBw0e0Q Been coming since it opened and have always enjoyed our dining experience. I have heard lately that it's gone down hill. I'm not really one to complain...but hopefully a poor review will help this business get its act together. Came with some friends on a weeknight...and they were out of my fav the half of a chicken.  No real issues, ok, I'll find some thing else...few weeks go by and my out of town daughter comes in late on a Friday...so I suggest Azul.We got there around 8pm and sat at the bar. It wasn't crowded at all. The waitress took our drink and chip order informing us it would be a few minutes for the chips...they were making fresh batches. We received the drinks quickly.....and that's where it totally fell apart. Our waitress disappeared outside on her phone. We sat for about another half an hour...and two of the waiters came up, got us drinks and gave us free guacamole . They said they saw us sitting there the whole time and felt bad. One offered to take our order. I'm not stupid...and I wanted to leave...but it's nearing 9pm and by the time we drive elsewhere....bottom line I was famished. The waitress reappeared and apologized...but went back outside on here phone!!!! They were out of the chicken AGAIN.....so we ordered salads  which were stupidly dinky and left.  We got in the car and I realized it was 10:10.... Unbelievable . Never again"...
