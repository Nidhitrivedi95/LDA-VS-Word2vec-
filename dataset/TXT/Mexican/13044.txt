0G1y7uV7w1D2uziS4Lt_Dw Not my cup of tea. Confused as to why this place has great ratings? The service wasn't ideal, food was a definite thumbs down, & no mexican flavor whatsoever. It felt like a complete white washed mexican restaurant. We also tried a "Preparada", & it tasted like straight tomato juice. Our server made us feel rushed the entire time, and every time we asked for something, he left so quick before we can even try to get another word in. Made us feel so uncomfortable to ask for anything. I think I would've enjoyed Taco Bell much more than this place.
