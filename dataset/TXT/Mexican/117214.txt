gOBxVkHpqtjRRxHBIrpnMA As far as burrito's go, this is my fav. place. I like the steak, pork or Chicken burrito's. Great portion and the ingredients are so fresh. They cook the meet in an open kitchen so you can see whats going on.  Was always a big fan of burrito boys in the past but now prefer Chipotle. Simple menu, good portion, fresh ingredients  done and for a good price - what more can you ask for?   Maybe a few more locations...
