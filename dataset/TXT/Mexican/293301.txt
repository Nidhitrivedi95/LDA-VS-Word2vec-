yydyoWCY3LJYlPwVLKbJ3Q Went here on a date after the Coyotes draft party.   I probably should have went somewhere else after talking to the waiter but I had faith.  I have a serious dairy allergy and he was not even familiar with dairy allergies.  After talking to him 3 times telling him exactly what to do, which should have been a sign for me to leave, I ordered my food.  I believe he used his best efforts.  The food tasted good but there was no guacamole on the carne asada guacamole tacos lol... The portions were real small and I left hungry.  Unfortunately they also did not follow my instructions as I ended up have a bad reaction to the food.   The waiter did his best but who knows what the cook did.  They need to be aware of food allergies they are actually very common.  Luckily mine is not life threatening but someone else could be.  I will not be back.
