yi9725wjRYYEoF-xE47_ig I'm always on the hunt for great Mexican food , I look for authenticity, I was really surprised that at the stratosphere in Vegas in the second floor they had a Mexican restaurant, at first I didn't think it would be good but when I saw the menu it look really good , I order the ranchera plate for about 12$ with tortillas and a salsa bar , it was Delicious, totally worth it. I went to eat there 2 days in a row.
