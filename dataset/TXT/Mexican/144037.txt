JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg DON'T let the location fool you!  After you get past the fact that it shares a building with Sapphires Gentleman's Club (separate entrances) you can enjoy all of El Dorado's deliciousness!  Not sure if its because the food is non GMO and as much as possible locally sourced; but on both occasions everything has been very flavorful and tasty!  One of my favorite Mexican restaurants!
On Monday is Local Appreciation with 25% off the bill including alcohol and don't forget to check in for a free Flan!
Both times coming here I have gotten the 3 street tacos with various meats so I could try the different ones.  I liked the Pulled Chicken and the Carnitas the best.  Each one is filled to the max and I have left overs for the next day.  
Hubby has gotten the same thing both times also; Pulled Chicken Burrito enchilada style (green) which is NOT on the menu.  On our first visit our waiter suggested it, as it was his favorite.  My husband also loved the Cilantro Rice.
Will have to come during Happy Hour next to check it out!
First serving of Chips and Salsa is on the house!  Salsas are all very good!
