QYuojrlW94mpEwnp0uUIWA We were hoping to get some nice Parmesan fries with fresh shaved parmesan on top. But instead the fries had dried canned parmesan like the kind you get at the grocery store in the little green can.  Also, the meat on both of our hamburgers was so overcook that it was dry and black on the edges.  It's not that this place is really bad.  It's just the cooks that lack the necessary training they need to cook a truly great meam.  On the positive side, service was good and the fresh made chips and salsa was perfect.
