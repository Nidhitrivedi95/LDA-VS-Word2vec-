QDRFdG8gPPKL7r4yic8j7Q This used to be one of our go to places and I would have given five stars six months ago. I always order the veggie burrito enchilada style which runs about $10. I have no problem paying that amount for good quality but my last few experiences have not been good. My $10 burrito consisted of sour cream, rice, lettuce and expensive enchilada sauce. Gotta cross this place off our delicious list. Sigh.
