a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg Was hoping for more, good reviews on the restaurant posted, but those people must of either had better service and/or different meal quality.  Food B-, Service D, Margaritas F, Atmosphere B+.  Close to our house, so we were excited about finding a great neighborhood Mexican place.  But unfortunately don't see coming back.  As we have shared in other reviews, this is Vegas baby, you may not get two chances to win a new customer- too many choices!  Each time has to count. Disappointed, expensive (especially for what we got), blah.  Roberto's taco beats this place any day (just get it to go and make Margaritas at home...). Forward we go looking for that neighboorhood Mexican restaurant. 

PS tambourines going off every five minutes made me want to kill myself!
