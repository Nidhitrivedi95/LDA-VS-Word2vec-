Eis_z-uF_2gUf83UE9blog I've been to this location a handful of times and it's always super packed so I recommend either ordering ahead if you're in a rush or take your time and wait in line which goes by super fast anyway. 

I was in a pinch for time so I phoned in my Order for the Thursday lunch special. When I went in to pick up my order the girl at the take out station had informed me that they had ran out of Tamales and that it would be a 30 minute wait so they could make more. I only have 30 minutes on my lunch break and I had already driven there so I was a bit annoyed. I told them I had just placed my order and they should have informed me before I came there otherwise I would have delayed my order and took my break at a later time. I asked  to speak to the manager who talked to the cooks and took care of everything and I received my tamales about 10 minutes later. 

I wish I would have got his name so I could write it but if you're reading this I would just like to say thank you for fixing the problem not only in a timely manner but taking care of it despite how busy you were.
