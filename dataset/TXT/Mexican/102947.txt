F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw i love mexican. i love mod mexican. 
i love momocho during happy hour. otherwise, i think it is slightly over priced. 
the margaritas are great. love the not so common flavors. 
the guac delish.
the entrees. eh, so/so. i was not blown away. i have tried different ones every time we have went and i just feel the same each time. my belly is full but just not overly thrilled or happy. 
there is always a wait, so either get their really early or make a reservation. it's pretty small inside, so not a lot of mingling room. there is an upstairs area that we have sat at once and i felt like the service up there was not as good as downstairs......(maybe they forgot about us), i feel that the hype of momocho is higher than the food actually really is.
