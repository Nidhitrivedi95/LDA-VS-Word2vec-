SUd3IyEN7n5OYEGyt_U5lg This place doesn't even get 1 star! Not because of the food because I didn't get to try it. I drove more than 30 mins just to eat here. Ben knew it was our first time there and he denied us service because he was too busy!! Are you serious with me? Ive never experienced such horrific and ungrateful customer service. He did say if we order online we would be taken care of right away. I didn't know it was an online restaurant. He had the worst attitude. I wish I could upload video. I won't ever recommend this place.
