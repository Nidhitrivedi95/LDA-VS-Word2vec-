S_bG5WWbtNXhhY9Y0GTcSg Let me start by saying I LOVE this place! However, as of last week we were really disappointed in their coffee. Their food is great, the tea is perfect---and the coffee use to be the best in downtown Phoenix. I sincerely hope Fame looks into this issue to see what things changed recently!! Also, I cannot for the life of me understand why they don't open until 7am. They serve coffee yet I'd venture to say they are losing out on a lot of potential revenue by not being open earlier...and not staying open later.
