Nz44ccUso3nq5S2OlQHNlA Was looking for another authentic Mexican place to compare with where I've been recently and the closeness and overall positive rating I found here on Yelp lead me here.
Other places looked nicer and were certainly larger, but so far this is the best Mexican place I've tried (shoot me a recommend if you have one).
Tiny place, I've been to this strip mall several times and never noticed that it was here.
Really good portions for the price.  Really liked the rice and salad, bean paste was... meh.
Tried a chicken Quesadilla (sp?), it was good, real good.  Another place that will be seeing more check ins from me in the future.
Did I mention tiny?  Only a handful of tables so depending on how busy they get you might want to plan on take out.
