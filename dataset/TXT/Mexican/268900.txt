woJ0p5-_bc1BCezm16qtZQ I love this Grocery Store. They have a ready food area, that is simply to die for. I really enjoy the Chicharron Verde with Mexican red rise and Frijoles Charros, your order comes with 4 tortillas. The prices are very reasonable. I specially like the short lines and there's always ample parking. There customer service is good and the employees make you feel welcome.
