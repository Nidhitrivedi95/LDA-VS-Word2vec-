F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw Service was great, food was great. Prices seem high, but the portion size is deceptively large. Between the two of us, we share the lamb and duck taquitos (both of which were excellent). We ate 12 taquitos total and wound up taking home about half of each order. The leftovers were enough for 6 more normal sized tacos. The cucumber margarita was unique and very tasty, and I appreciated the tequila selection and sangrita chaser. The only thing that didn't sit well with me was the price of chips and salsa, but if you're sharing among 4 people rather than 2 it's not so bad.
