Z8SXv1u_6rKicQy9P7G6fw My go to place for late night dinner, and never disappoint every single time.

My go to meal is the parillada combination (assortment of bbq meat) and horchata. I have to admit the horchata is one of the best I have tasted. It does not have a lot of cinnamon, and stronger milk taste. Caution that it might be too sweet for most people, and you might have to dilute it with water a little bit (it will still be good!)

This place is simply amazing, and I do not think a lengthy review would serve it justice.
