SW6ZQk22G1_CV81_gfnvNQ If you get a kick out of cultural appropriation and salivate at the thought of blowing your disposable income on a fun night of eating tacos and sharing a 40oz of Old English straight out of the paper bag to some incredibly loud, braggadocious rap courtesy of Rick Ross while surrounded by trust fund hipsters wearing what can only be described as 'goth grunge' attire (navy blue lipstick, chola eyebrows, precariously perched toques, and endless plaid), then you will LOVE La Carnita, which is almost an exact replica of Grand Electric except bigger and with good service, and ps - definitely get the churros.
