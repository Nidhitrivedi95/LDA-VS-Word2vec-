IMb5BpDLlSbr7yn19HhltA The food here was decent, the service a little on the slow side. And they forgot to bring out my girlfriends aunts beer. We were almost finished, so she just asked the waitress to cancel it. Some time later she came by and said the manager took care of that for us, really? First, the bar tender just has to pour it in a glass, then a manager needed to cancel it? OK anyway there was no beer. Nothing great to come back for, but if your plans are to meet someone here or just want to try it, then again, food wasn't too bad at least, several choices looked good.
