Voeq7aGDmCGMjE_SQiHwRA Public service announcement! Awesome new restaurant on Penn that will NOT break the bank! 

Knowing that this restaurant is a chain, I didn't have the highest hopes but was confident in my experience based on my fellow Yelper's reviews. I met two friends for a HH on a Monday around 4:45pm. We got there just in time because the placed filled by 6pm. Their special margarita flavor of the night was watermelon but they have a small assortment on their menu. Two of us ordered the spicy marg and one ordered the watermelon. Well, slap me silly and put a sombrero on my head- the spicy margaritas were top notch and hit the spot! And I've been to Tako and tried their spicy concoctions! Fresh, crushed jalapenos and just the right balance of marg mix with tequila sealed the deal for me with this drink. I'll order it again! Our friend sucked down her watermelon marg in record time and raved about it.

We started with fresh gauc, a side of pickled jalapenos and queso. The queso can be modified (add chorizo, etc) but we opted for regular. It comes out with a browned layer of cheese on top and the consistency is similar to hummus but the flavor is great! The gauc is fresh and even better paired with the pickled jalapenos! Two of our three got the pollo rojo (chicken) and I got the hongos (mushroom) Fresh and exploding with flavor! I look forward to trying more of their menu the next time I am in Pittsburgh. 

Our waitress offered great suggestions, she was very knowledgeable and friendly. Great addition to Penn Ave and the Mexican food scene in downtown Pitt!
