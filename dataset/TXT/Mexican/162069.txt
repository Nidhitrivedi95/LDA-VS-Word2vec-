l1GJnB9TJgGgEeI4at1M0A Some of the best Mexican food I have ever had!!!!
The chips are fresh and the salsa homemade and delicious.
My wife ordered the chiliquiles and I ordered the three taco plate.
The chiliquiles were very good, great flavor and still the crunch from the chips. The three taco plate, I ordered 1 chicken, 1 el pastor, and 1 cochinito. The chicken and el pastor were very good. The cochinito, which I have not heard of before, was one of the best tacos I have ever eaten!!!! The flavor of the pork and sweetness of the pickled onion, not really fond of onions but these are great, was absolutely delicious.
I fully expect these guys to be in a bigger place in the not to distant future!!!
Will definitely be eating here every time I am in Vegas!!!
