Te-BqwJZt8S0fu9ltlq3Eg Best authentic Mexican food we have experienced on the southeastside. Excellent value, great portions, and wonderful food quality and taste. They also have some of the best drink and food specials, as well as mariachi band nights. I technically give a 4.5 star because service can be just average sometimes. However the food is quick and excellent which will make up for the more straight forward service.
