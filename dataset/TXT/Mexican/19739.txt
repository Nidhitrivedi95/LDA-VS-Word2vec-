1x8_aJQ-iqvymhRK3SNbLg We decided to try sharky's after seeing the Facebook ads. We went for taco Tuesday. I saw Menudo on the menu and decided to try it. It was good and the corn tortillas were delicious. My husband and friend had the street tacos and said they were very good. We also tried an order of churros with ice cream and I must say this dish did not disappoint. Now for the reason I only gave it 4 stars: the service. Only one young lady was working in the front and there were quite a few customers. We waited a while to order and waited even longer for our food. I had to ask for chips and salsa after the food was brought to our table. The chips and salsa could've been better. I will return to try your tacos soon. I definitely recommend this place!
