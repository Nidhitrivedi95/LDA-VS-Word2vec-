Friendly service and GREAT food. I ordered the tostadas de mariscos and the Hubster ordered beef tacos. They gave me the option of making mine entree size, which means an extra tostada and refrained beans and rice. When I got my food, I realized that I had made a horrible mistake. This was WAAY too much food. There were three large tostadas on a big plate. 2 would have easily sufficed. It was exactly what I wanted... basically ceviche on top of fresh guacamole on crispy tortillas. It was topped with pickled red onions which were too salty, so I just took them off. The chef dropped off the plate and said "Please finish the whole thing", a joke since my eyes probably went really really wide. These were DELICIOUS. I'm craving them right now.

The Hubster really enjoyed his beef tacos, which were a reasonable amount of food. He was able to help me with my dinner, which he also thought was incredibly delicious. 

We left incredibly full and satisfied. We'll definitely be back again. It was a little pricey, but the food and service was just fantastic!
