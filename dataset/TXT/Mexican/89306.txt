dr2SFQloieTs2oXj9r_9AQ The salsas were interesting.  The salsa verde in particular was pretty good.

Service was prompt and friendly.

I order a combination plate with an enchilada, chile poblano (chile stuffed with jack), rice and beans.  Rice and beans were average.  The chile was *not* dipped in egg wash and then fried.  The enchilada tasted like something from a frozen dinner.  Everything was also _very_ salty.

They have a lot of seafood dishes on their menu, but they also have wings, go figure.

I might come back once more to make sure my dining experience wasn't a fluke; otherwise, I will not be back.
