zCmwErM82hdKl4L2UixDJw I was here meeting a friend and we sat on the patio. Chips and salsa were there when I got there and were very good, the queso is a must. The drinks were awesome and the tacos were so stellar. I got one hard shell and one of the other ones...the one that's like a double taco, so yummy. The service was sub par. The server was pretty clear that it was time to leave "Are you ready for your check yet" I didn't even get to finish my food. She dropped our check and came back very quickly asking if we were ready, I've never been kicked out of a place before it was very off putting. Maybe I'll try Tremont next time or just get take out.
