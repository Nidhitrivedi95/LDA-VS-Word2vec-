zrcs31Gt6HuWX_RCWW-mCQ Terrible, just terrible!

I was asked to wait 15 minutes for a dish( meaning i would miss my movie) NOT fast food in that sense at all!
Next, my sister order a meal with a combo. The server repeated and confirmed the order. The bill came up to twice what it was supposed to! He blamed the customer for ordering incorrectly even though he repeated and confirmed the order. When i approached the server, he blamed the customer on ordering incorrectly even though he had repeated and confirmed the order. I informed him he would be losing 2 customers forever if he did not wish to fix the error.  He did not care.
His macho attitude may have gained him an extra 17$ today, but he has lost at least 2 customers forever!
Save your money and go to a real restaurant for the same money!
