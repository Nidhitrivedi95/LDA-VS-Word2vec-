Staff's really friendly and helpful. I ordered 2 Carne asada street tacos & green chicken enchiladas. Tacos were super delicious! Enchiladas were stuffed with actual chicken chuncks!! I prefer mine with a little more sauce, but they were still good. Oh and the beans! Yuuuum... they were actually whole beans.. not the can refried beans. Rice was pretty good too. Definitely check them out!
