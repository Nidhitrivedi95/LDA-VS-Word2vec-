eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw Be aware, there is no longer happy hour on Saturdays!!! We used to go there all the time (we live nearby) but likely will not be back. The service is always slow because Nacho Daddy always seems understaffed. Our waiter complained to us one time that he was the only one responsible for the dining area! The food is ok, the margaritas by the glass are good (quality for pitcher margaritas strangely varies), but the service was really only worth it for happy hour. Most disappointing is that the website still advertises happy hour while they don't honor it! We'll go somewhere else.
