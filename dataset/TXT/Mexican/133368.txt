iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg This is my favorite taco place in Toronto and one of the best tacos I've ever had! I've visited three times now and they are not only delicious, they are super consistent! My favorites are the blackened Mahi Mahi followed by the shrimp and cheese! 
Blackened Mahi is sooooo well seasoned! The taco has a crazy amount of flavor and everything is so well balanced :)! The shrimp and cheese has a great kick of spice and I notice they take the time to clean the shrimp very well - much appreciated. It's cash only but totally worth a trip to an ATM for some tacos! I find two are filling enough but I always opt for three anyways! It's that good.
