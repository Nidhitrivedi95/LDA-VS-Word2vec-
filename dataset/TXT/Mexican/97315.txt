eJPckkV1k7gn0V2awA1pzA This place is the best! I've been coming here almost everyday for lunch trying each item. Waikiki bowl and North Shore is my favorite. Lahina bowl when I want something with a kick. Cant go wrong with the taro chips or mochi.

Staff is always welcoming. Thanks Rosie and Chalissa
