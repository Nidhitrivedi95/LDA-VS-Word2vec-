99YJMvaaYwDry-SQuC63zw You always know what to expect when you go to a chain restaurant, but this place really sets itself apart from the crowd. The food is what you would expect, well made, tastes great, but what really prompts me to write a review is the quality of the service. They smile, say thank you and engage with you as a human, not an order. The staff is always happy, the manager asks you how the food is. They are genuine and care.

I love chipotle, but this is the best location I ha e ever been to. Keep up the great work guys. #chipotleislife
