d_L-rfS1vT3JMzgCUGtiow We came to Law Vegas for our beautiful wedding, and decided to host everything and everyone at Mandalay Bay. When it came down to choosing the venue for the rehearsal dinner, it was a no brainer. The food choices that border grill offered caught my attention right off the bat. When booking this reservation, the staff worked with me closely and really helped me out putting together a menu for the whole party. Which by the way, they were able to accommodate 22 people! Our customized menu consisted of Cuban panini sliders and Beef brisket flautas for starters. We moved into our chopped Mexican salad and then the main course. We had a choice between grilled skirt steak, topped with caramelized onions or, like marinated half chicken. To top it all off, our final course consisted of our tres leches cake- which was a crowd favorite. Our servers Autum and Gatsby were very friendly and attentive. Really pleased with how everything turned out!!
