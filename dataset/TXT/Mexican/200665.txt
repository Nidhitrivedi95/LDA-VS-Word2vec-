pf3kPNPGA15kggbgL92UXg Got one word YUMMM!!!

I love Mecixan food! I could live off of this food!

I went last thurs with a few friends of mine..(was before toy story 3 show) 

We walked in with our stomachs growling.. the food smelled so good.. the lady got us seated instantly when we walked in.. wasn't busy at all.. so picked a good night too come in..we sat at a booth.. (very comparable) as soon we sat down our waitress was here instantly.. (that's what i call service)  she was sweet.. she asked us for our drinks.. i asked her for a Shirley temple..(has refills)  I usually get that drink when i eat Mexican food..lol than right after we got our chips and salsa was SO good!!!! I love there chips and salsa!  Beats Garcia's(from az)  if u want some good salsa and chips.. come here!!! Its free!! 

Right after i pretty much filled up with chips and salsa..I looked at the menu.. everything looked good.. But i got a Cheese enchiladas with rise and beans..(my fave) was $11.00 it was kinda pricey.. but not bad..(hey if u wanna eat some good Mexican food.. gotta pay a little bit more) 

waited..12 min.. than our food was out.. pretty good service..for serving 3 people at a table.. 

WOW! I can see the steam coming out of our food when that tray came out.. was hungery.. was nice and hot.. wasn't cold at ALL!  My stomach was so happy at the end of the day.. Good place for family and friends to eat.. Also for a date! I wanna come here with my hubby soon!!

Thank u guys!!! I will be back with my tummy rubbling!!!
