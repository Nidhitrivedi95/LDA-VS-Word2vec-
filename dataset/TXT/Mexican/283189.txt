XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Really tasty stuff. 
The best part of the meal was the sweet potato soup, great flavors with an extra kick from drizzled chili oil. We got so much food I can't describe it all. The lamb on the lamb salad was perfectly cooked and tender, although the salad could have used a little more. Burgers are good. I enjoyed my sword fish club but the bread choice was not my favorite. I'll go back to try more of the flavorful menu. Southwestern fries disappointed a little, I was expecting more flavor from them. 

MEN: you can't wear hats in the dining room FYI
