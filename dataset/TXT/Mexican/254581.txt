V9KtZRYkprtkTPMDK31HMA I really want to give GTC 5 stars. It's in our neighborhood and I qant it to be successful. Stopped in about 2 weeks ago on a thursday night around 7:30pm with a friend. Wanted a drink, a bite to eat, and to listen to some music. We were seated right away. Drinks and food took forever. Forever. It was painful. Multiple staff came up to our table asking if we were being helped so there were definitely enough staff for the people in the bar. I'm wondering if the kitchen was understaffed. Drinks tool forever too and all I ordered was captain and coke. Food was good. Decor was amazing. I will try again and hoping for much better service.
