knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw I was here a few weeks ago with friends. 

The food wasn't anything special. The restaurant itself was a bit on the messy side and extremely crowded. We ended up waiting 45 minutes for a table. 
A few friends were in from out of town and wanted to drink before we saw a show. 
I wasn't really impressed with the food selection.  I would have been if they had the shark tacos. 
Anyway, I ordered a few tacos. They came out cold and the tortilla wasn't warm, it was actually a bit on the stail side. I had to pay for some sour cream. 
The drinks were tasty, a little over priced and not really that strong. I don't think we'll come back.
