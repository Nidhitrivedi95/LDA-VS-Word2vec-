jsuUmIEefPjV__ads62Z5w Read about this place in a WSJ article and had to check it out.  I'm glad my wife noticed someone else here on Yelp wrote that there's NO SIGN OUTSIDE.  Look for Luci's Market.  When I saw Luci's, I parked, then we walked along the strip mall until we found Dick's Hideaway.  The previous review wasn't kidding - there's NO SIGN on this place.  They do have a bulletin board with a menu posted though, so you know that's the place when you walk up to the door.

Loved the decorations - liquor bottle, cactus, liquor bottle, cactus, liquor bottle, cactus, liquor bottle, cactus, bowling ball, sewing machine.  It works, right?  The random signs they have posted on the door and around the bar are pretty funny, too.

It was pretty clear we were the only non-locals in the place.  There was no room at the bar.  Everyone who walked in or out the door said hello or goodbye to the staff by name.  The place was pretty small but we didn't have to wait for a table at 8 a.m. on a Thursday.

The coffee was very good.  I had the carne adovada benedict and it was excellent.  My wife had the heuvos rancheros with green chili sauce.  She thought it was too spicy.  I thought it was excellent.

Service was a little slow, but quality takes time.  My only minor annoyance was they served the table next to us before they served us, and we had been there a good 5 minutes before them, but then they were locals who knew the names of the staff.

The menu looked awesome.  I'd love to go back there and eat every meal during this weekend getaway to Phoenix with my wife, but she would like for us to branch out and try something different.  :-)
