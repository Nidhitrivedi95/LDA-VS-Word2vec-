CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q If you're not a patient person I don't recommend you come to this location.  On an average I have waited about 15 or 20 minutes to order my food. But being a foodie I appreciate good food and especially when it's tacos. None of the staff ever seem to be overwhelmed with how many customers they have. It doesn't matter what the wait is you know you're going to get great food great service and overall it's just a fun experience. It's always extremely clean as they have employees Around the Clock cleaning up and putting everything in order. For as popular as they are, they should really consider expanding the location that's located on Charleston and Bruce. I love their tacos al pastor with everything on them...and i tell anyone that enjoys a good taco about this place.
