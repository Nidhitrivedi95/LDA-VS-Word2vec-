0AQnRQw34IQW9-1gJkYnMA I was excited to try this restaurant because of all the positive reviews boy was I disappointed. One of the worst restaurants in Vegas. Took forever for our food to come out. Diablo Tacos were EXTREMELY salty. We had a waiter by the name of Marcus. He was the WORST. My friend Was trying to get his attention because he wanted hot sauce. He ignored our table and decided to ask the people behind us If everything was ok with the food.  He did not once acknowledge to see if we were ok. Very disappointed with restaurant. Will not go again. BEWARE of Marcus if you look like you don't have money he will not serve you to the best.
