_iEl9sCLsvXEFHUWPvgsAg Was downtown for business and looking for authentic Mexican - the hotel said this was it for something within walking distance.

Awesome ambiance. Great service. Food was hit or miss... Elote was awesome - huge cob of corn with the perfect balance of flavors and a tiny bit of kick. Duck tamale was okay - it was huge, but had very little duck and the flavors were a bit muted. Pozole was delicious - flavorful, well-stocked with the ingredients described, and perfect balance of meat and fat. White sangria was okay - I'd get something else next time.

All that said, I'd return and try other dishes, and would order the elote again for sure!
