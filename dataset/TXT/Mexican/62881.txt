aXRrMXXoAN7lawHICgmsxw I work downtown and saw this new spot had great reviews so I decided to try this out. I came with a coworker and we were immediately greeted when we walked in and chose to sit inside. I didn't want to melt outside even though the weather was nice. Everyone was very friendly and we never felt ignored. 

I had the all day burrito and a coworker had the soba salad. Both were delicious and my mouth watered as I saw other food coming from the kitchen. I am definitely excited to go back and try some of the other items on the menu. They serve Mexican coke and coke light here as well which made my meal even better.  I did also hear there was a good happy hour here, so definitely will check that out soon. 

I was bummed I was too full to try the churro ice cream sandwich, but for sure next time. Great food, pretty fast, I definitely will be back.
