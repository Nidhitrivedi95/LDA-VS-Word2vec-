O_UC_izJXcAmkm6HlEyGSA came here last night for the first time. there was no wait because we came at 9:45 but I can see why it would get so packed. its quite small and cozy. the patio was so pretty at night-had lanterns everywhere which gave it a nice atmosphere. it was too cold too sit outside though so we sat inside. equally nice atmosphere with music and nice lighting. 

our waiter was very friendly. we started with guac (medium spice) which was one of the best ive had lately. I went on to have chicken enchiladas and beef tacos. both were yummy and had nice presentation with toppings. I found the shredded beef a bit heavy because they put a good amount of meat in there plus the tortilla is fried crispy but it was good nonetheless.

I had the Mexican ice tea which I would get again-it definitely had enough tequila to keep me happy :) 

will probably try to drag my boyfriend back again to try other dishes
