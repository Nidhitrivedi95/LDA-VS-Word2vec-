0kyVqnMoflj3DLDecGK89Q My experience was awful I went in the morning to get there breakfast item's and they they were rude about tvthis to I was ordering and they said they didn't have enough hash brown to supply all those items and then they said they didn't have eggs are you kidding me. So I went to dinner for it and the customer service was awful and the food was bad too I would not recommend this taco bell yo anyone. I wish corporate could fix these issues and make this taco bUnell better. Also I was sitting in drive thru for 30 min that is crazy
