z4K95Y4P5nMrtJiDtXWDYA Food was mediocre. Ordered flan for dessert.  Not bad but nothing special.  Service was not very good. They did they they were short staffed as waiter called in sick.  

Ice cream on the menu was not available.  Would not recommend and won't go back.  Just too many other Mexican restaurants to choose from.
