scLvLqVVIOWZbVT-exGjjg Awesome local burrito spot in Davidson. Huge portions and yummy food. Love that they mix corn and flour tortilla chips. Was slightly disappointed that there were no taco tuesday specials but the did have a few drink specials. Overall yummy, average priced date night spot. Would definition go back.
