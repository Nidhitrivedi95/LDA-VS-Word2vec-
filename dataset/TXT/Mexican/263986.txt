Wbi-x-1Nbn6LFCMOSN6F5Q Only 3 stars because the cashier was rude and argumentative. I do not like it when the service forgets who the customer is, and that I have a choice where I spend my money. The food was excellent,and the service up until the cashier was perfect. This was the second time that this same lady was rude, the management should not have her communicating with customers. The bathrooms were dirty, and the floors needed mopped... that's where she belonged.
