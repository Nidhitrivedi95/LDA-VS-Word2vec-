OFaMjL9nLF-A51KHNW8nfg Came here today for lunch with 2 friends. We got there at noon and we're seated quickly as they had just opened. We were given waters and menus and while looking at the menus my one friend found a NICKEL in her water, she initially thought it was part of the glass. We told the waitress who seemed appalled and quickly got her a new glass. We started by ordering the large mango guacamole, the waitess said they didn't have mangos, but they could still put cheese and peppers in it...ok. When the guacamole came out, it had mangoes it...lucky us I guess! The large is super small, could definitely not feed more than 3 or 2 really hungry people, for $11 this is a joke. The tacos...were not impressive at all. I ordered the green shrimp curry taco and the chorizo taco. The green shrimp curry doesn't have shrimp in it!!! They use tiny shrimp chips!!! The chorizo looked like tiny pieces of ground up thrown away sausage that was drowned in sour cream...wtf? My friends tacos were equally unimpressive, we will not be back! If you want good tacos go to Bomba in Fairlawn!
