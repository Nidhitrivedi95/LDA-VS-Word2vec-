wEisic-u9Yj543iYzfpAhw I thoroughly enjoyed this place.  I had a margarita lujo with fresh lime juice (very good).  The fresh chips and two salsas they bring to the table were awesome.  I had the appetizer platter as my dinner since I was short on time.  All very good.  Small place, nice ambience, super nice wait staff, fast service.  I am coming back for sure.
