woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ I wish that I had something different to say from all of the other reviews, but when it's good it's just plain good. I've sampled many different combinations of the made to order guacamole, and had a variety of tacos (carne asada, chicken, mahi, and Korean just to name a few) as well as the cheesecake, which I had no intention of trying until the waitress recommended it.  Every. Single. Thing. Is. Amazing. Every. Single. Time. If I have any complaints it would be that I have to make a reservation for a weekend dinner about two months in advance. But again it's worth it.  I'm not a huge drinker, but I sampled my friends margarita and it was refreshing and crisp... Not a one that comes from a mix or a blender.  I would also advise that the ambiance, while very trendy and fun is incredibly loud. If you're looking for a place to have good conversation I would probably not choose Tako. Instead I would go to Tako, eat, and then go somewhere else to talk!! Whatever you do...put this spot on your bucket list...you'll be glad you did!
