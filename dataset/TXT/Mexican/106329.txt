Fkj8vJocYilePMZv2y54WA Identical to Robertos... You get what you pay for and it's pretty damn cheap so don't understand some of the complaints here.  Great for a quick fix and that's really it...  Wife usually orders the fish tacos and I normally get either the carne asada fries or nachos.  Both seem on par for an $8 meal.  If you're looking for a little more...  suck it up and drive to Cafe Rio.
