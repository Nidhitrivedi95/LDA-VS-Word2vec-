Things seemed to be winding down for the night but I imagine that when things are a rocking this place might look like the bar scene from "Dusk till Dawn."

We sat down and ordered up some margaritas and began consuming the chips that were placed on the table.  I can not confirm nor deny if those chips actually were charged to the tab.

By our second margarita I did hear something about them possibly being $12 a pop.  My buddy returned with some coupons for a margarita discount.  We ordered up those and found that they are significantly smaller than the ones the proceeded them.

The dining room area is dark....read the menu  carefully.

I ordered up a $16 quesadilla with shrimp.  My buddy had nachos with chicken and beef.

When the quesadilla arrived I almost fell out of my seat.  Gone was the presentation and there was very little garnish.  You could do better at a Rubio's Fish Taco shop.

The nachos were nachos.  It's kind of hard to mess that up though I have been to a couple of places that have but fortunately this was not one of them.

High prices for mediocre chow is for the drunk tourist walking around with plastic Eiffel Towers filled with watered downed alcoholic frosty drinks tied around their necks.

Next time I'll stay sober and take my guests off the strip to get mexican food that is cheap and goooood.
