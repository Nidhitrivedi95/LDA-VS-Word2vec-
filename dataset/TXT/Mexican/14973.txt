1-EjdZhVZFuNG6ReBS0rvQ Rude staff!    Rude hostess!  We generally go here once a month of so.   Well tonight they lost 20 customers.   Could not accommodate us and blamed us!    Snobby hostess came over and berated us twice.    Both times we asked her to go away and just stop talking.    Manager refused to come over and called the cops.   We were having a birthday party for a dear friend and we were never rude or in any way out of line.    Cop was super nice, asked us to please get out stuff and leave.   He made sure no one paid for food only the alcohol as we only got half of what was ordered.   And that half was messed up.     Shame on you popos!    Officer Gonzalez even advised that we find a new place to go and that he won't be eating there either!    If you decide to go, don't complain.  Don't ask for a manager.   Obviously he's afraid of customers!!!    Both Popos are off my list of restaurants.    I'll stick with Ajo Als or Top Shelf.
