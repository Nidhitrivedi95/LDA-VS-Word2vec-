80gdzmn-E3IaXK7Z6qzC6A Good burritos...be prepared to wait in line if you go at rush hour but likely worth it. Sweet pork burritos are unique and good....also try the chipolte chicken burrito (not on menu)..it's tasty. The nachos were not good. It would be great if they offered ground beef as well as shredded beef as an option.
