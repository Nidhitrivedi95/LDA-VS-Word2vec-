Bf2fuqWbHd3L-X69FSMvmg On a recommendation we headed to El Trompo last Friday. 

I love the vibe in Kensington Market, especially at the end of a work week and especially in the summer. 

I love it even more because I can walk through the streets freely with my kid and not feel like people are looking like I have three eyes for bringing him out with me (ahem, Yorkville...ahem). 

El Trompo is a tiny, hole-in-the-wall authentic Mexican restaurant, the best way to be when you're a Mexican restaurant, in my opinion. 

The guacamole and chips is great. We shared an order of fajitas which are served differently than I am used to- with melted cheese directly on top of the meat/vegetables instead of with all of the fixings on the side. Everything was so great, we'll definitely be back. 

Beware the lineups in the summer though, and El Trompo's apparent popularity- there are like 6 other Mexican restaurants within a few blocks of one another and none are as busy as this one.
