Seriously amazing brunch here. I love that they serve it all day because the location is out of the way for me. 

Their eggs Benny's are out of this world. Buttery, creamy and perfectly salty. Also they give the option of pairing it with both roasted potatoes and salad! Waistlines rejoice! I wish that was an option everywhere. 

I have tried the breakfast burrito - it is filling and delicious. 

Drinks: I enjoy the bottomless coffee with a shot of bailey's. The sangria - I would pass on. It's more fruit juicey than wine.

Service is great! The only complaint I have are the bees and flies that pervade the dining area. I wish they'd do something about it, but I guess that is to be expected when the front is open. The chorizo eggs Benny is worth getting stung for (unless you're allergic lol)
