I chose Pollo Asada for my Jumbo Burrito and wasn't all impressed with it.  The chicken wasn't that flavorful, and even though I hadn't eaten a full meal all day I was only able to finish barely half of it.  I planned on saving it for the next day, but I ended up not even finishing it because the flavor was so bland.

I would recommend Carne Asada Jumbo Burrito, since a lot of my friends got the that for their Jumbo Burrito and gladly finished it. 

Service:  I came with a large group (~20 people), so the wait is kind of long. Probably shorter with less people.
