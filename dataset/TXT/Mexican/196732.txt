oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ Saturday night visit for dinner and cocktails- terrible and snail-paced service. Got our drinks almost thirty minutes after ordering, and then our food just a minute after our drinks arrived. The server was MIA for practically our entire time there, and then when he finally came out seemed confused about the fact we needed things.

I tried to order a mexican mojito from the cocktail menu - the server said they were out. (How are you out of mexican mojitos?) So I told the server that if they didn't have the mojitos I'd take a skinny margarita. According to the menu, the skinny margarita was supposed to have blueberries in it. My drink that came out? Not a single blueberry... pretty sure I didn't get the right drink. I ordered the chicken tortilla soup which was good, but not mindblowing.  

Overall experience was pretty terrible. I might have just gotten unlucky and visited on a bad night and got stuck with a bad server... which is a shame since the ambiance of the restaurant seems very fun and cool.
