nOmR49imE4GtmwWVLkHS9A I was really excited about going to this place since they have tamales. The food wasn't bad. But the service was horrible. Our Mexican server walked out midway through the meal to get his stuff then came back and sat at the table next to us to eat enchiladas. He never told anyone to take care of our table so we sat there waiting for someone to notice us. Nobody did. The other one server never came. We asked someone else for our desert, I had to get up to get our check. I'll never go back there and I regret having left a 15% tip.
