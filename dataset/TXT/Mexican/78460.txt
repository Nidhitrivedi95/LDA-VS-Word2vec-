cp0F3ayzAFOBKc16oMbBKw A wonderful experience from arrival to departure. I unexpectedly walked into this unique spot-an ambient, romantic atmosphere that meets down to earth with regulars watching the basketball game! The bartender/owner/chef greeted us immediately. Our waitress was friendly and full of recommendations. I had the Steak Loin plate-which was delicious. Matthew is creative, artistic and is truly a skilled chef. My medium rare steak was cooked to perfection and the plates were beautiful. This restaurant then topped my expectations with a margarita sorbet for dessert made at our table on the spot by Matthew himself. It was amazing! The staff is so kind. I would highly recommend supporting this local restaurant. I had a superb experience. Thank you Mizestro!
