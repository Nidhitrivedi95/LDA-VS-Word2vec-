2dUXkonsAdoXKAalTnmlig Food was nothing to write home about. Chicken tacos were lacking on the meat but the taste was alright. 

My main problem, and the reason for the 2 star review, the lady in back very visibly prepared the food with no gloves and without a visual display of hand-washing. 

Also I refused to take a straw because they weren't in wrappers and were just sitting in a cup.. who knows how many peoples fingers have been all over those straws all day?

Won't be returning, many comparable restaurants with better cleanliness standards.
