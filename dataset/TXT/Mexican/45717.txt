They have a crazy $0.99 special on their margaritas during happy hours which oddly goes from 11am to 4:00pm.

Compared to other mexican food offerings in the CLE area you'd be hard pressed to find any real faults to the food, and service. Very fast, and extremely friendly.

Oh, and by the way....try the tamales!
