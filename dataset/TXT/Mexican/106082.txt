fK1oj0dk9Bc6KsBk5mMDxg Just came for the 4th time. I made the mistake of making a reservation at one of their other restaurants thinking it was this one. But they sat me anyways on a busy Saturday night. Excellent service.
I got their ceviche which is easily the best in the city, always so fresh. And 3 tacos, the carne asada, the spicy shrimp and the octopus. All three were amazing, but the shrimp was the stand out.
Each time I've been both the food and service are impeccable.
