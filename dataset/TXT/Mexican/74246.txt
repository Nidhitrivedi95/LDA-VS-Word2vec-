cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A You have got to be kidding me.  Are five-star yelp reviews a condition of employment at this place?  I love a good dive more than the next guy, but this place isn't funky, it's filthy.  I've seen cleaner crack houses.

 "Fusion" here means doing a crappy job of two cuisines and hoping nobody notices after the mashup.  The result isn't boring, just unpalatable.  Pour chalula on some chow mien and you'll do a better job.  (I tried that, and it was a step up).  Quick tip - they will provides "tastes" (odd use of the word, considering the lack thereof) so if you really need to check this place, try a sample, and follow your instinct to turn around and bolt.

Can't understand the four stars.  But I also can't understand why Palin got more votes than family members.

We had to go here for a christmas gathering.  I know I'd been bad, but next time, Santa, just go with the coal.
