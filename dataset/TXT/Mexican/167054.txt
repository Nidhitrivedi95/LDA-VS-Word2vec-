lrAUseySfmFeZkWOGfsKnQ After a day of shopping, the last thing I wanted was to eat in the food court or go to a chain restaurant so it was nice to stumble across this, a few minutes walk from Fashion Square on a one way street. 

The service was friendly, the food came out quick and most importantly, a good portion of meat on my carne tacos. The meat was nicely cooked and the toppings fresh, which ultimately made for a tasty and quick lunch. The only downside? Not much shade eating out on a sunny Arizona day.
