MM572Htt9k_e96IKNyCEtA The breakfast here(most hotels in USA or this hotel) is a joke! I have traveled to Shanghai, Hong Kong, Japan. Many of the 4 or 3 stars hotels there easily beat this one! This hotel charges 27 dollars for a breakfast buffet that only serve breakfast you can get in Denny's breakfast menu (or less) and has zero international appeal. Whoever runs this hotel needs to take a trip to other Asia countries that I mention to see how the Asians do it! If you really want a nice brunch buffet nearby, go to wondering horse buffet in the talking stick casino resort instead !
