wHxe_D6_MPhMLNuHVLMIqQ Roberto's is ok and has plenty of options, but at the end of the day I would rather go to Fausto's or Phat Phranks.  They have better prices and make the order the way you want without any confusion.

We order from Roberto's a few times and asked for no onion or no pico etc.. and they managed to mess it up too many times.  Love the location, but will drive further for someone who understands what I want.
