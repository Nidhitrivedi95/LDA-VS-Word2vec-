UDucqwO8PwUOwcmUsJ-gOA I am not adventurous as to try out places as I travel through a town but we picked some friends up at Phoenix airport and they wanted to try something so they started looking and decided this is where they are going. I walked in and it wasn't overly cool and the ventilation wasn't the best and I'm thinking this is not my thing. But the waitress came over and she was just the nicest lady and we ordered and got our food and it was delicious!! I would definitely go here again but do plan on leaving there smelling like food. I had a pastor taco which was great. The salsa was tasty. With everyone's meal came a small cup of hot bean soup. I am not much for beans but my husband ate mine and his both and said it was so good. Our friends at carne asada burritos and tacos and said they were amazing. So if you like true Mexican food your going to like this place.
