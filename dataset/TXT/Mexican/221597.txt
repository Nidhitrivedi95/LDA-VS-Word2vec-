rNNVuA-xq1SVEQaLzrK4bw I ordered a carnitas burrito and there was more onion in this burrito then there is anything else. I literally bit into my burrito and had an uneven taste of onion versus the tomatoes and meat that was in it. After three bites, I could not take it anymore. There was so much onion in this burrito, that it practically ruined everything else that was in this supposedly "carnitas burrito" .I'm not the biggest fan of onions, but I can usually handle it on burritos and tacos, come on I'm Hispanic.(onions are essential in our recipes) I paid $7.60 for this burrito, that  I ended up throwing away because it had too much onion and it was not the tastiest. I'm definitely not coming back again and I don't recommend it to anyone, nor am I ever returning to this restaurant, or any related chain.
