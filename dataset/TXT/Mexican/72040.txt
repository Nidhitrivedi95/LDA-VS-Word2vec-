c5TOGBUCCUUNBPM7h_KbmQ Went here for lunch today!!! It does remind me of Roberto's because of the way things were layed out in the little restaurant, but it was more affordable than Roberto's, and the food is just as good! I had the Carne Asada Fries!! All I gotta say is.....I'LL BE BACK!! Love it!!!!!
