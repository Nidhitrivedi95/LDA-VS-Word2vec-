kkmnzRWOq9mJVpQQzgv-9w Upon my first visit here, 3 yrs ago, I discovered that the menu was identical to our local Mexicali Rosa's. I was unaware that it was a chain restaurant of sorts, but I was quite pleased because I have a love of their Nachos Con Pollo. Like, unholy love. Mmm. Definitely ordered those and was not disappointed. Went with a few friends and the server was chatty with us, but not overly so. Very relaxed service, though so if you're in a hurry, you might want to say so. 

Fast forward 3 yrs and Mexi's has closed but Hernando's remains. Was reminded of its existence on my last Toronto visit and went for those yummy nachos because of that unholy love. Mmmm.  Also had a bite of my mom's chimi and that was good, too. But it's those nachos I crave.
