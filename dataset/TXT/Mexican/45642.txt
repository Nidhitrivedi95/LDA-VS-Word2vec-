7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA After seeing all the positive reviews here, I wanted to check this place out.  Well, not really, but my brother did, so we went.  Monday morning, packed.  Cash only, not great.  Usually cash only means better prices, but not here.  For just under $30 had we each had the hash browns with two eggs.  In a fancy restaurant I could maybe see that...maybe, but this is not at all fancy.  And they called what we had  poutine, which it was far from.  For a small, crowded, expensive joint, it was absolutely not worth the money, and I wouldn't recommend it.
