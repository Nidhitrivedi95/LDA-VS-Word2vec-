6XpqswYWoSOx0a9MkosVRA Was in the area and wanted something to eat. Found this and saw the ratings so took the chance and ate here. We will not be coming back. Service ok, not exceptional and that was surprising since it was us and 1 other table.  We all ordered a variety of the tacos and was not impressed. Never seen such small tacos. Amount of food for the price, was not worth it. Food was edible but flavor could have been better. None of us cleaned our plates. Will try somewhere else next time.
