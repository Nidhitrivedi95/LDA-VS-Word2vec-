MrovSlB5Ff0v4VGnvC2i_Q El Tren is a cool little spot on the Summit County Hike and Bike trail. They have some of the old railroad cars out back, which is a nice touch.

The patio is great - spacious with an outdoor bar (though I have never seen it open)

The table side guacamole is really cool. They peel the avacados, mix the garlic, etc etc right at the table for fresh guac.

Good frozen margaritas!!

The food is basic traditional Mexican that you can find at many similar types of restaurants all over the US. Not much changes from place to place. But El Tren does the food well....just nothing unique.

The three stars are due to service. Both times that I have been there, the service has been unapologetically slow. This last time we sat outside for 10 minutes before we even got a drink order. The chips and salsa would never have come. Had we not reminded her. 

If you are looking for Mexican in the Tallmadge area and you have plenty of time, the food is well done and the margaritas excellent.
