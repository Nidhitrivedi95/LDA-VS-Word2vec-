mibbKeg4gbD9O58TCjDWgQ Smallest and most expensive burrito I've had compared to the rest of the locations. The tortilla was super hard and the place was pretty dirty. They also charge you an extra $1.25 if you use your debit card... This place is not worth it, I would recommend a different location.
