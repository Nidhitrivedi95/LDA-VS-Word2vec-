gdtZA3sVQ5Hk-3oPBArdLA It is Zabas.  You know what to expect and there are no surprises to be had here.  This is Chipolte with a bit more quality.   The staff is friendly enough but a bit heads down.  The place is clean and tidy.   

They have bowls, tacos, burritos, etc......  Nice place for a quick lunch.  There are better, there are worse.
