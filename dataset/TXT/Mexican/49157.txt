So be prepared to eat in your car. There is a reason they do not have seating- so please do not base your review off of that. The decor is so cute and I love the idea of the place.

The ingredients were good and fresh. They seemed high quality to me. My chicken taco was SO SPICY. I do wish I knew this beforehand. I literally couldn't finish the small taco because my mouth was on fire. The coleslaw on it was a really nice touch. I think $3 for a gourmet taco is a very fair price. 

UPDATE: already came back and they changed their chicken! No longer super spicy!! I really appreciate a place that listens to their customers :)
The vegetarian taco is also delicious! The beans are cooked perfectly.
