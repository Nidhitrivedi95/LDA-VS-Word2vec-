YaTlfyPieOXwHH16wzieFg I come to this location almost every week, especially for Taco Tuesday.  Love their coconut shrimp tacos, always get them for me and my husband, have to have the mango sauce to go along with it.  The food is always delicious and quickly prepared.  However, tonight, the service here was just horrible.  You get a drink with the combo, so I go to try and get the Passion tea they have out to the side, it's empty.  I try the raspberry tea, they have some so I fill my cup up with ice, only get a little bit before it runs out.  Then I try to fill my cup with lemonade to make an Arnold Palmer.  The machine is out of lemonade.  I go up to the counter to the employee there to let her know the lemonade is out as well as the Passion Tea.  She says she will go fix it.  After waiting for something to happen, I go up again to ask about it and they say she had to fix it in the back.  I ask her again about the teas after noticing all THREE teas they have are all gone, if they can make some more, which she says she can one at a time which will take about 5 minutes each.  I wait until it's been 5 minutes and it's still not done brewing.  At that time, I just wanted to go home and eat my food.  Not good customer service, they weren't busy and couldn't fix it in a timely manner.
