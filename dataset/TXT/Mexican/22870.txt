2jzM7PSeG8OwZ5EvocCpQA Chipotles are pretty much all the same to me (which is a good thing from the corporate point of view).  If you're a regular, you know what you should be getting in regards of cleanliness, service, taste and so on...

This is the closest Chipotle to my house.  The food is good, up to Chipotle taste standards and filling.  This location gets really busy though during typical food rush hours!  However, if you beat the rush or wait just a bit after, you can get your food SUPER QUICK!  The furthest I've ever seen the line is about 20 people (from the counter to the door).  So I guess you're never really waiting beyond 15 minutes.

The service is quick, fast and up to par.  Happy munching!
