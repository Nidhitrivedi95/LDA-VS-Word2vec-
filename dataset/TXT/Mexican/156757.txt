khOsPUxJuf5R3cmgiZnk6g Located at the Yonge & Finch intersection, on Finch, west of Yonge. To be more exact - it's right beside Coco Bubble Tea. It's literally a mini food truck with eye-catching yellow signs - so won't be hard to miss.

Friendly staff. There'sh only 2 items on the menu - you can either get a Churro or Churro + Ice-cream. Reasonably priced (~$4-$7). Small selection of flavors, where you can mix and match or ask for recommendation.

I tried just the churro mixed with oreo crumbs and condensed milk. I didn't even know you can mix the two flavors! The churro itself was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Be careful, it can be pretty hot as it's done right in front of you. The flavor itself was a little on the sweeter end, but that's expected. And it's a pretty large size - enough to share as a quick snack for two people.

I'll come back for sure to try their other flavors - and it's very hard to resist when it's aromatic as you walk around the neighbourhood!
