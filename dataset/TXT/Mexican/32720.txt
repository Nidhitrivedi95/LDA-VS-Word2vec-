4OUGSeQeASZGn9nSb8Ialg Stayed in one of the hotels at Lake Las Vegas 2 weekends in a row, both times with our young grandsons. This is an excellent Mexican restaurant. The food is incredible. The wait staff are fun and do a great job. Our grandsons made sure we had lunch and dinner here one day. We, of course returned the following weekend for dinner.
