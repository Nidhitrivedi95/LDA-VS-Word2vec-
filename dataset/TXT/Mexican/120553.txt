H-B_JoResY4PyXND1_DQfg Restaurants along Mcknight are so hit and miss...there's a few I will no longer eat at.

I frequent this Mad Mex often for drinks and food (used to go to the one in Oakland just for drinks).

Overall I'd give it 3.5 stars.  The food is pretty consistent, but every so often we'll each get "upset stomachs" shortly after eating it.  Still, it's a step above the quality most restaurants around here and one of my favorite in the area for a quick meal and cold drinks.
