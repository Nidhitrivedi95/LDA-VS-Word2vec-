qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A My wife Shelly, two friends Keith and Katie, went here for dinner the other night.  We had heard about DW Bistro from a friend and we thought we'd stop by before going to see 'Elvis' for a little pre-theatre dinner.  We were absolutely delighted by everything we encountered in this restaurant.  The ambience, friendliness of staff, service, and most of all, the food were amazing.  We literally could not stop talking about it long after we had left the restaurant.  Between the four of us we ordered the Fried Chicken, Turkey Sliders, New Mexican style slow cooked pork, and the Beer Braised Short Rib.  All four of us tried each dish and this is the first time I have ever been to a restaurant where all the dishes at the table were as outstanding as the next.  I had the pork and could not stop eating it.  It was so tender and so flavorful and all of the deliciousness of it was soaked up by the rice and made it the best rice I have ever eaten.  It was hard to finish for the fact that I was stealing bites of my wife's corbread, which was amazing in itself!  To top off the entire experience we met Bryce who we found to be one of the friendliest restaurant owners we have ever met!   We all cannot wait to return for another great experience and great food!
