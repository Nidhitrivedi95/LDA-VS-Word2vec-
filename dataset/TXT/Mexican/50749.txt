8ysapimCImBSDKl28qIrjA Be aware this place will charge your card for a tip if you don't pay attention. My family and I having been coming to this restaurant for years and I have always had a good experience that I was aware of, however when I looked at my card transaction from Friday January 13th, 2017 I notice they charged my card for $19.55 and my bill was only $16.55. On this day the place was packed, the place was super dirty (I can understand since they where busy but still have someone quickly wipe stuff down), and the cashier I had was not polite nor was she paying attention. She was more concerned with the cashier next to her and talking to him. Please be careful when paying with a card here. I am sure since I don't usually check my card transactions here that I may have been wrongly charged before too. This place in my opinion has gone down over time and the food is still good but everything else seems to be lacking.
