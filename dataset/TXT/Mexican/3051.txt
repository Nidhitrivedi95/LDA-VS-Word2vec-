-mf9zEA55pDGua4aF0XKCw This was kind of a neat find for me, personally. Well at first. I've been to a sister restaurant about 90 miles away several times since the day it opened over a decade ago. Same signage, same exact menu.....



Pros: 

Food comes out fast.

Menu is extensive.

Guac is good. 

Queso Dip is good.

Ridiculously large portions



Cons:

There's nothing Mexican about the staff or the feel here. Not like in Salem, OH. 

Waitress was not very attentive at all.

The quality of the entrees was a subpar. The dishes seemed "right" but not right...like maybe I got someone's leftovers reheated.


All in all, though, if you are hungry and want the kind of Mexican food that will stick to your ribs and make you feel horrible about your life choices....this might be hte place for you.

If you want a actual good meal and want to feel like you are getting even a smidge of Mexican culture......don't.
