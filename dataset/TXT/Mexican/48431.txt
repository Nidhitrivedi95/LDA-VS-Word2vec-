89uU51kOiQXbJHVA3C6XMQ Went on my lunch break on a Friday which might have not been good as it was really packed. I had called in the order but there was still a long line to wait in. The food it's self was good and at a reasonable price which was a plus. The place it's self is small so not very much space to dine in.
