aG-QcGdP7yY7-UPyeyvNCA We decided to try this place that I have driven past countless times after reading such favorable reviews.  All I can say is thank you for posting these reviews because I would never have discovered this great little local joint.  We had lunch on a weekday and the service and atmosphere were both wonderful.  The food however was better than wonderful.  Super fresh and simply delicious, not to mention a great deal.  Do yourself a favor and check out El Paraiso for great food and friendly and prompt service.
