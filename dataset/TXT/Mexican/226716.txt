S_bG5WWbtNXhhY9Y0GTcSg Fast casual breakfast & lunch joint with fresh decor and friendly service. Honestly surprised at the food options and quality. I had blueberry pancakes and tried the french toast - both were delicious and packed with flavor. Very impressed by this little cafe and think you will be, too!
