a9strREjmyUp961wdhhA5w I go out of my way to go to this Taco Bell!
The food was hot and well prepared
Elijah took an accurate order
Chassidy was a busy bee keeping the lobby clean and was very personable
All the people on the line we efficient and speedy in making the food (I don't know names)
and the Manager Gordon was outside taking the garbage out!
Nothing better than a manager that leads by example and doesn't let the "button up shirt" make him to good to take out the trash!
*My only complaint is that my Doritos locos taco had almost no meat in it and the shell was broken.
