TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag Cool Latin American grocery store that has the best taco bargin in North East Ohio! I've been wanting to stop in and check out the store for several years and now I'm wishing i would have come sooner for lunch. Ordered two tacos to go, one chicken and a chirzo that only totaled $5.00, I've paid more for 1 taco of far less quality. Both tacos tasted great and i was suprised how much filling the ladies behind the counter were able to put into these delights. Looking forward to my next visit and spending time checking out the groceries and other product for sale.
