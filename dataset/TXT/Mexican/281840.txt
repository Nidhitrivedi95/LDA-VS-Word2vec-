XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg A bit disappointed in my meal. Wife had the shrimp tamale, enjoyed it. I had the veal chop and ordered a plantain tamale instead of goat cheese tamale.

Veal chop was ok but at $48 not amazing enough. I couldn't eat the plantain tamale, it was starch + starch + sugar = blech, and I love both tamales and plantains.

Brussels sprouts were in syrup, would have much preferred a crisper sautee with bacon. Also didn't finish those.

Blue corn duck pancake was tasty. Spicy pork was also quite tasty. Our waiter recommended a sweet Riesling to match our meals, it worked for my father-in-law's pork but was odd with my veal.

Ordered the cactus margarita, fine but not outstanding.
