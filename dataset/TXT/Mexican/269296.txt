woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ I had a pork taco at the Pittsburgh pickle festival. This hands down was one of the best I've ever had. I like it when you're trying new clever foods and you ask yourself what did they put in there? I loved how spicy it was and I loved how they were butchering the roast pig right in front of everyone.  Definitely going to check out their actual restaurant.
