woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ My boyfriend and I made reservations a month in advance, and when we arrived we were greeted and brought to our table right away. The vibe is very hipster-y and the noise level is pretty loud, although we were still able to hold a conversation. We started with the ceviche and queso fundido. The ceviche had amazing flavor and we both enjoyed it a lot. The queso funded was pretty good, although the cheese hardened very fast so you have to eat it quickly. I ordered the al pastor tacos and my boyfriend and the pollo tacos. We both agreed the al pastor were superior to the chicken ones although they were both very tasty. The only downside was that the food was all pretty spicy, even though we ordered some the least spicy tacos, according to the waiter.
