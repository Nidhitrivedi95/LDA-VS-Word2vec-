This one of my favorite Mexican foodie spots in Las Vegas. I've been to all locations within the valley and the food has always been consistently good (at all locations) for as long as I've been here, 16 years. 

And they have THE BEST Carne Asada Fries in Las Vegas. I first tried it in high school or college at the other locations and it's always our go-to since it's located across the street from my friend's house. The portions are HUGE. Fries are cooked to the right texture, not too soggy or greasy and not too crispy. It's loaded with tons of Carne Asada meat, loads of shredded cheese, and if you're taking it to go, they are more than happy to put the guacamole and sour cream on the side. 

For some dishes especially the Chimichanga, it's freshest in the early morning. The shredded chicken in the Chimichanga is tender. Sometimes it's dry during late afternoon or dinner time. But it may have changed since the last time I got it. 

Other tid bits: 
- Portion size is legit. Burritos and Chimichanga are HUGE!

- Great Bang for your buck drink sizes. I like their horchata. 

- My other favorites are Enchiladas and the burritos.  

- Always Great service! 

- Hours and location is convenient for me. 

- Hands down, Fausto's over Roberto's. 

- And I'll repeat again, The BEST Carne Asada Fries in Las Vegas. Try it! You'll thank me later. ;-)
