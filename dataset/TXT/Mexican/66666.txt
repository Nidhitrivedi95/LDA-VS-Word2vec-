Bf2fuqWbHd3L-X69FSMvmg Tortillas here are nothing special and really small. Chicken tacos were tiny bits of chicken covered in onions. Husb had the pork fajitas and I tried one. It started out tasty and oddly smoky and then turned into fire in my mouth. I know a few people who would love this simply for the spice, but for me it wasn't enough, really. I like flavor, too. 

Lived near the Mexico border for too long to enjoy this as "Mexican food." I have never seen tacos so small or so...boring. Even the chorizo was just so-so.
