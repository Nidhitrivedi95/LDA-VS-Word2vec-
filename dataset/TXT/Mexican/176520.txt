MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA Haha, I reviewed Electric Mud and not Grand Electric!

Now I've been here twice and let me tell you: best tacos ever! 

The first time we went on a very busy weekend night and had to wait over at Electric Mud. The wait was about 25 minutes for a table for two, not terrible. I really like their hostess system and the fact that you receive a text and not a phone call. I don't remember much from that night (WASTED!) but I do remember being so happy to get tacos in my mouth that I bit my tongue quite badly. It didn't stop me from eating though. That night they had pig's ears tacos that were so delicious!

I just got some takeout from there and ordered what I remembered as being very good: scrapple, baja fish x 2 and beef cheek. I really, really love the scrapple. The baja fish is one of the best fish tacos in Toronto. While the beef cheek is okay, a little too heavy on jalapenos and sauce and the meat is on the dry side.

I really want to give this place 5 stars but I dislike the intentionally created atmosphere. The servers are aloof, a bit too cool to actually be servers. The hostess, however, was very friendly and helpful. I think the servers can be cool and helpful...if they tried. I also don't like  the extremely loud hip hop that's played no matter the day or time. I feel like an old person yelling "get off my lawn" but it seriously deters me from bringing friends here and showing them the amazing tacos! 

Also what's up with not being able to take-out whatever I want to?
