L-_-9JNAb6UDyq7waykX2A I've been wanting to go back ever since I left this place. Waking up thinking about sushi, making lunch thinking about sushi, contemplating more sushi for dinner. Mexican sushi is life. My husband and I went on a Saturday night and when we arrived the place was pretty full but we were seated immediately. I don't really like the table setup, they aren't that comfy & I felt like a sardine almost all crammed in there. I'm really confused as to why people are complaining about the prices, we've payed similar prices pretty much every place we've ever ordered sushi, traditional or not. Our bill was around $50 for 2 rolls & 3 drinks. Yes a little steep but well worth it in my opinion, and I'm almost sure this will be our new anniversary/special occasion go to (good bye red lobster) Some better drink specials on weekends would be nice. The food was excellent, seriously, like I want to go back right now. We got the culichi(sp?) & tres quesos. They have a live DJ And he played all Latin music. It was really loud and almost like a club but I enjoyed it and had no problem conversing with my husband. Our server wasn't like  THEE best, but he wasn't bad either so I can't complain about customer service. The hostess,who actual reseated us into a "intimate" booth did so very willingly after we placed our order and I felt 1,000 times better and probably enjoyed myself way more once we sat in that booth with some funky lighting fixture that cast a great orange glow. 
 **Bottom line..
Cheaper drinks on weekends and this place will get 5 stars from me. I definitely recommend and will definitely be returning.
