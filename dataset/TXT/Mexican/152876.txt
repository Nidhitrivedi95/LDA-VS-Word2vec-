She ordered the beef taco appetizer as her meal and asked for sour cream on the side.  It didn't say anything in the description about guacamole, yet when the waitress brought it to the table, it had a big blob of guacamole on the lettuce.  We called her back and told her my girlfriend was allergic to avocados and we sent the plate back.  Only a couple minutes later, she came back with the nachos, no guacamole could be seen but the lettuce looked messy.  And my girlfriend and I looked at each and went, did she just scoop it off and give us back the same plate?  But we gave her the benefit of the doubt.  Well before my girlfriend had eaten a quarter of the nachos, she said she was starting to get itchy.  Within a couple minutes, she started having trouble breathing.  She started digging around the chips on the plate and found some that looked like they had guacamole on them.  We called for the manager, it took a long time for him to come over and we told him they just gave her an allergic reaction.  They comped the nachos but we still had to wait around for what seemed like forever for someone to bring the check so we could pay for my food, all the while my girlfriend's allergic reaction is getting worse by the minute.  She was choking when we left, she was throwing up in the car all the way to the ER.  Thankfully she was treated at the ER and she is okay but suffice it to say we won't be back.
