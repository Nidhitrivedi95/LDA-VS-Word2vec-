spvjNOYeR7sFX6yTgP21og If you can get a table here and get served, DO IT!  My friends and I made a reseveration to go here for dinner which I remember at the time thinking was unneccesary, but my friend insisted as she had tried to go on multiple occassions and had been told they weren't serving food (despite it being well within their hours of operation) so we played it safe.  Lucky we did, since it seemed like moments after we got our table, the place was packed.  We tried the Queso Flameado with cactus as a starter which was really tasty - unfortunately we had also ordered vegan nachos which went to the wrong table and so we didn't get them until our meals came, but once they did they were also delish and loaded with toppings. I had the Burrito Con Guacomole with faux chicken and it was out of this world.  It was enormous and stuffed with so much deliciousness I am practically drooling just writing this. The faux-chicken was prepared incredibly well, super tender and loaded with flavour.  The guac is awesome and generous (nothing is more disappointing then skimpy guac!) and their salsa verde is crisp and complements everything perfectly. My friends had an assortment of other things (fish tacos, garlic soup, etc) and everyone was raving about how good their food was.  The drinks are also spectacular, I had the classic margarita but tried my buddy's Michelada (a pint with lime, worchester and tabasco) and it was unlike anything I've had before and worth going back for on its own.  We tried the deep fried soy ice cream for dessert, and despite being more than stuffed from dinner I couldn't help but offer a helping hand in finishing this treat - again, a very generous portion, the batter was crisp but not oily and had a fabulous honey drizzle that went perfectly with the soy cream.  I need to stop writing now as my stomach is starting to grumble.  Worth the 5-stars despite the nacho hiccup, go go go!
