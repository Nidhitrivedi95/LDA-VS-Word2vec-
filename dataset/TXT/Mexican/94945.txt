EBVegXKWCu5AOWox7gnU5w This is a nice family restaurant on St. Laurent. The colorful decor may be a little off putting but do walk in, the food is good. I went there two vegetarians who were impressed with the variety of veggie options on the menu. I had the grand beef burrito and was very satisfied. I find their 'half service' attitude strange: you come in, get a menu, sit yourself down, choose a dish, walk back to the cashier to order and pay, sit back down, get served water and whatever you ordered, but need to get up again to get your own utensils and salsa.  Still, the atmosphere is good and it's nice and quite. I was bothered by the flies than engulfed me (and the one that drowned in my beer). Also, as we were leaving, there were some off putting smells (toilet/cleaning products?). This hasn't happened when I was there in the past, and I hope they abolish that fast!
