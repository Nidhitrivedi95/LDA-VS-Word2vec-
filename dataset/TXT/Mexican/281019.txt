XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Oh this place kills me. I wanted to dislike it. I was felt myself being overly critical from the second I sat down with my party of 5. I have always been somewhat annoyed by Bobby Flay, for a variety of reasons. Mesa Grill overcame my issues with their no-show celebrity chef. 
I had the charred, bone-in, ribeye with a sweet and spicy chipotle glaze with the green chili queso smothered mashed potatoes. The potatoes were very good and cheesy with just the right chili bite. That was fine. Let's get to the main event. The ribeye was almost confrontational in its size and presentation. Everything about the prep and presentation was..., aggressive: aggressively cooked over a very hot charcoal grill, intensely spiced and plated with very little else on the place other than a little bit sauce and garnish. Let me tell you, it works. When you have a prime piece of beef like that, perfectly cooked, I don't know what more you should do to spruce it up. I made the comment, "I could see Elvis eating this." All of the other members of my party were very happy with their meals. The chorizo tamale was a little dry but it was still well executed. The atmosphere is an extremely modern, Southwest vibe. I thought the "lobby" looked a little like something out of Barbarella. But I did like that movie... The service was good. It is a little spendy but the quality of the ingredients and presentation more than met my value expectations.
