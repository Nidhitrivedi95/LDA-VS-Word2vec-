gEv1Og5uGDLw9HkbKSGUZw Let me say that this review revolves more around their food menu then the 'bar' menu.

As we were in the area looking for a quick place to eat, we decided to check it out due to the 'taco' menu even though it is a bar.

FOOD

Five of us ordered a mix of multiple tacos and appetizers and everything we had was very tasty.  

PRICE

The downside is that while everything we had tasted great, the tacos are essentially $5 each and we each had at least 4, plus appetizers and drinks.  As such, the bill hiked up quite quickly.

SERVICE

With regards to the food items at least, you should expect to wait before receiving your items.  Walking to the restrooms you can walk by the kitchen to see why as it is quite small with only two people working when we were there so if there is a lot of people ordering food and you are on a schedule, then this probably isn't the best place to go.

From a drink aspect, then service seemed fine.

Despite the sticker shock with the bill and it taking, way, way to long to eat, we still enjoyed what we had.  

As a 'meal first' type of place, I would suggest going elsewhere due to the price and speed.

As a 'drink first and eat on the side' type of place, then I would go back.
