Most of the time is $5-6 because all I get is double steak no beans no rice so it's a "3 pointer" but depending on the cashier I get charged $12. Train your staff to know what they're ringing up and managers to know how to correct the problem instead of saying "come see me next time". Will not be returning to this location, I'll drive further to the Chandler Blvd location where I know I don't get over charged.
