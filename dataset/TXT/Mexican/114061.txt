gEv1Og5uGDLw9HkbKSGUZw There's quite a number of Mexican restaurants opening up now, so quality needs to be high to compete.  El Cabalitto does a decent job and tries to differentiate themselves, although maybe a little too much.  

Rather than the usual nachos, they serve a combination of plantains, sweet potato, totopos and taro chips.  I would have  preferred some regular corn chips as well, but I welcomed the change.  I didn't like being charged $4 for the salsas though.  They also change up the tortillas in the tacos, which each have different textures and ingredients.

Some interesting takes on margaritas as well.
