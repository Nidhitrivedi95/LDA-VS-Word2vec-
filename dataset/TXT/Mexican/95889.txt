This is a new start up place and been only open for about a month but I can tell that the people that run it are not new to the business.

I have my favorite spots and I'm always looking for another and I think I just found one. I have had two meals here,  late lunch and breakfast and both have been very good. Breakfast today, which I just finished, was an avocado and onion omelette with country potatoes.  ( Sorry, no pics of food, ate it before I thought about it)

The Omelette was very light and fluffy with a huge amount of avocado and onion inside and two different types of cheeses on top. The onions were sauteed just right and tender and the avocado was fresh and plenty of it. Sometimes places cut back in this area. Not so here. 

My potatoes, while not cut on site, we're cooked from fresh cubed potatoes and seasoned just right. 

The only negative, if you can call it that, is the coffee was a bit weak for me but I like my coffee strong. It was also a bit warm inside for me restaurant but as I enjoyed my meal, it cooled off. 

All in all, I certainly can recommend this new start up! 

" I'll be back!! "
