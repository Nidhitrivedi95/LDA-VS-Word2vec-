pJdPcHkqtaLF47pS0LxdYQ The decor is nice enough, but service is slow,and the staff is semi-friendly. Food prices are high (even during happy hour), yet portions are small. Drink specials are laughable, and the happy hour margaritas are served in a thimble. 

Tried it once, and now I know better! You can do way better for $60 cooking at home...
