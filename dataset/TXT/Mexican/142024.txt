Jd2NUZeVeyWi1tTNKXMt1Q Had the enchilada plate. Both red and green chili sauces. The red tasted good. The green was OK. Wasn't the best but was better than most places I've tried here in phx metro area. Sopapillas were good, they come with the meal. Their not a desert like most Az Mexican restaurants, but honey does come with them. Overall good New Mexican food.
