-FNquqGseSCVMWo7KbK-Tg Wow, this has to be one of the worst Chipotle's I've ever been to. We avoided the one on the strip because of the wait, so we decided to come over here. When we walked in, we got the worst vibes. It seemed like the workers all HATED their jobs. There was only ONE chef in the back who was trying so hard to chop all the steak, cook the fajitas, rice at the same time and constantly replenish the food. ONE dude! 

The other workers in the front were seemingly inexperienced. The girl who poured the rice gave me a really thin layer or rice, and the next girl slapped on a pound of sour cream. Sour cream overkill-- so I asked for extra rice. She said she would have to charge me extra. I've never had a worse Chipotle experience. The Chipotle's in SoCal are way better!

One good thing to this place is that there is parking. But that's pretty much it.
