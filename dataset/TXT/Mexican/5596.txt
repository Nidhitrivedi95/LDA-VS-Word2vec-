_5wi2C7x68Bt14qhdCqi1Q Wasn't going to say anything until girl swept dirt on me.  Girl sweeping rug towards me and I can feel dirt hitting my legs, wow!  Wtf?  Seriously!  Get a vacuum.  Whole restaurant was dirty and disgusting.  Sink in men's room faucet handle broken.  Restroom also dirty and disgusting. Then over charge me for my burrito, asked for no cheese but she charges me for it anyway.  I'll never come back to this one.
