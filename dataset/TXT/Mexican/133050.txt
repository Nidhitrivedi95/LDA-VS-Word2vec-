iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg Seven lives is super busy with neverending lineups and some of the tacos sell out if you come later in the day.

Ordered Baha Fish, Adobado (spicy pork and pineapple) and Pollo Asado (spicy chicken)

The good: for the most part the ingredients are spectacular, super fresh, tasty, and the various topping/spice combinations that they put together are a perfect, well thought. The pork and chicken were both cooked and seasoned to perfection. It was sooo good. When paired with the toppings... wow, so good

The bad: their soft taco shells don't do the rest of the ingredients justice. They give two tortillas per taco, and I found them a bit dry and too thick. Also, the baha fish taco was underwhelming for me, it was mostly fried batter. Maybe I got a bad piece as others rave about it. It looked more like fish and chips put into a taco shell. Finally, cash only and seating is pretty much non existent

4 stars
