pEH8XwiyGOe1t7GlboAgGw Upscale Mexican cuisine with great service! I have been to the restaurant 3 times in past year and every time it manages to impress me. From pomegranate guacamole to ceviche to carefully curated summerlicious menu, every dish was full of flavour but not overwhelming. One of my favourite is the Guarache de Pulpo en su Tinta - octopus cooked to the perfectly that is juicy and tender laid on top of a bed of squid ink sauce (very interesting concept).
