jDQIKfsfJU3M8M6n0ESKFg Having a Carolina's so close to home is dangerous. The tortillas and hot sauce are so tasty! The dining room is packed every night and expect a wait but it's definitely worth it. Picked up take-out 4 times in a week! We've tried bean burrito, carne asada burrito, cheese enchiladas, and machaca cheese tortilla. All delicious, especially with their hot sauce. I'm not keen on hot sauces because I usually don't like the taste (not because of the heat) but I really like the hot sauce here. 

I read someone else's complaint about the A/C here and I laughed out loud. As a native I'm so thankful that the dining room is nice and cold. 

Thanks Carolina's for coming out to the east valley!
