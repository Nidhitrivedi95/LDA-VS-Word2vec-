iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg Stood in line forever for this. Is this the only taco place in town? Im not impressed by their tacos. Kinda pricey for how small it was. But maybe bc im use to the the Mexican town in my area.

I got the ceviche &  thought it was ok. Just regular ceviche, nothing stands out for me. I also got tbe catch of the day,  and i felt like the fish had a weird taste but thats just me,  i have a sensitive taste bud. Was kinda disappointed by this place w all the hype. They also ran out of fresco when we got to our turn =( very busy place & I'm sure alot of ppl love it. Just not for me
