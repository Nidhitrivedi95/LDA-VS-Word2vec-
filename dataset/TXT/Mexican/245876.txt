ttgfifuRK6svfWcXoGG-mQ Having come from California, the Mexican food is lacking in Pittsburgh. And my husband and I have tried a LOT of places since we moved here. We made the trip after having read the reviews, and this place is awesome! The food is as close to what we would get in California. Wonderful flavors and spices. And no white queso! Still have no idea where that came from. Never saw it in Cali or Mexico.
