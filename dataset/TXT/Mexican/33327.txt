The only issue I have is that everything on the menu is in Spanish so we had to struggle through our order. One of the people in the truck came over while we were ordering and spoke to us in English, but our food still didn't come out the right way. There were ingredients missing on 3 of 5 items plus they made extra food that we did not order and charged us for it initially (although to their credit when we brought it back up they refunded our money).The food is delicious, but you might not receive exactly what you order. I would still say...try it!
