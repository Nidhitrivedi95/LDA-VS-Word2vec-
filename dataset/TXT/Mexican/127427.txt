HWl2EbZhkhAkFgqt44yUkA This is a really fun place. It's kind of dark, but lively. They place great music, serve good drinks, but the food is pricey. We have never had BAD food, but some items are too expensive for the quality. We like the outdoor seating to view the Las Vegas strip. Overall this is a fun place.
