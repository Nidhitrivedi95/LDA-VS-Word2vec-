frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A La Santisma was our first stop upon arriving in Phoenix. It was over 100 degrees outside and my family, bf and I were hungry. I was craving street tacos and found this place on Yelp! The Argentinian steak and the dog shark tacos were my favorites. The salsa bar was awesome as I laid out different types of salsa in front of my plate. The best part was sipping on a huge drink of horchata! I also admired the Mexican paintings on the walls. The restaurant was small, packed, busy and worth the wait.
