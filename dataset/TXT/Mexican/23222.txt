2lF1UsGcDpDpaI1lXgRX_g Liked the chile relleno with cheese albeit small. Good sauce. Now for the bad. Nothing else was very good. Beef enchilada was blah, no seasoning, not enough sauce to even taste it. QUESADILLA AL HORN was just ok. More like a taco. Had it with chicken, sauce with the chicken was like cambles soup. Same with the SAUTÉED CHICKEN ZUCCHINI.  Might have given two or maybe three stars if the service was acceptable. Our waiter was awful. Missed an ordered item- never got it cause done eating after we saw him again.  Reeked of cigarets. Pulled plates and dropped the check before we were done. Quick food arrival- not sure it's a plus.  The food arrived moments after our margaritas (pricy but good) - hard to believe each is made to order...
