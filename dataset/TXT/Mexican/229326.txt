scnWmw-edweZpj-N3kk9gQ Short wait but overall poor service. No silverware, napkins or a bowl for chips/salsa. It took two requests to get a bowl for salsa. The appetizer comes and still no plates and silverware. "How is everything?"  We don't know... We can't eat our food. No plans to return believe me.
