0rjArZxONWhzsr58ddAeEQ Ordered a naked chicken burrito plus cheesy bean and pulled pork burritos for the family. Service was slow but maybe I'm just used to the fast pace at downtown food courts. Skimpy servings and bland taste. So skimpy that I had a cream cheese bagel and a bowl of cereal when I got home. Also they forgot to call out for the cheesy bean so it was left sitting on the shelf for 15 minutes. A real disappointment.
