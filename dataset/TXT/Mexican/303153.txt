zxVw9U56heInhfyprhkxIg I would call this sub par Mexican food. Ordered shrimp tacos and one shredded chicken. The shrimp tacos were smothered in a spicy red tomato sauce with veggies (4star) but the tortillas were dry making it unpleasant. I ate the shrimp and veggies only. The shredded chicken taco had no sauce and was dry as a bone. The chips and salsa was good but not great. I would eat here only if I were on foot and unable to drive down the road for better Mexican food. Unfortunately this place isn't living up to its previous 4star rating.
