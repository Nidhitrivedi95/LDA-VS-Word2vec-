fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg Dined here our first night last Thursday during the Supernatural convention we had one picky eater and another who didn't eat meat. It helped that we stayed in the hotel and had a two for one on the margaritas since they weren't cheap but they were tasty. Love how they came in glasses made out of recycled patron bottles. Loved the trash can nachos added the asada they are layered well so you get equal amounts of cheese to meat to everything else quantity. Those pickled onions on top were yummy. We also tried the fish tacos and shrimp quesadilla.
