4u1iOihWOVkgNTId927fHg First impression, the staff are inviting. My waiter has a Spanish accent so it must be good right?. I decided to listen to the waiters recommendations.
The Loco, margarita made with Trombo tequila is amazing despite the fact I hate tequila. 
One moment please, waiting for my taco, tortilla chips and fried avocado dish.....
Verdict ....Taco, made with soft corn tortilla. The kind of tortilla where you can taste the corn and not just a bland floury thing. Tasty zucchini fritters with small amount of veggies placed inside. Add the hot sauce and beautiful. 
The cheese soup is a medley of fresh veggies and chunks of Mexican cheese. Mild flavours but wonderful. Seems healthy despite the chunks of cheese.
Fried avocado halves. Breaded perfectly. Served warm. Loved them
Pico de gallo, can't go wrong. It was great as well
This place is situated in the location of the old Jamie Kennedy Wine Bar. You can't beat JK's but this is close
For those of you who have complained about the portion size, maybe you should get the hint.
