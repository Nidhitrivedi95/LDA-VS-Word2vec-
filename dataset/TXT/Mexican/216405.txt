R5WkKWo9ae2gN2feWtB_4g I used to love the food here. Haven't been here in a few years. Tonight the food was awful. Cheese enchilada was chewy and no cheese inside. Basically a tortilla with cheese on top. Flavorless beans, margarita that was literally ALL sweet and sour. I barely touched my food. A waste of money and calories. I won't be back. Servers were nice and attentive and the salsa was still good so the reason for the two stars.
