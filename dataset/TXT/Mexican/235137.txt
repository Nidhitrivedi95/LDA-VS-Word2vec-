svdEhLmNmpVaIv1WLtoOvQ One of the best taco places in town! Crunchy chicken is one of the best Ive ever had. Juicy chicken, good sauce, and mashed potatoes! Barboca was also delicious, but the shrimp one was just ok. My friends say the lengua and other chicken tacos were also good. Lots of tacos to choose from as well as other items. HH only includes 4 basic tacos and is better for drinks, but taco tuesdays is .50 off all tacos. The passionfruit margarita was super strong, but yummy. Would give 5 stars but server took a long time to take our order after serving our drinks and on the check the HH prices didnt show. When we asked he said "again?" Not sure if it was only that day and not to be cynical but I think they dont check before giving it or fix it unless you say something. Besides that he and the bussers were very friendly. Food also comes out fast.
