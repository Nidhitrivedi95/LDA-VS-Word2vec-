iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg Came on pedestrian Sunday so their star taco was not available. I ended up getting a grilled mahi mahi which was humongous (for a taco) and filled with flaky fish. It was a little messy to eat but delicious. Place is tiny with only one table and mostly standing bar area, so it can get crowded.
