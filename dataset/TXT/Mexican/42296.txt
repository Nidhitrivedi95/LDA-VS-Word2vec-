75u8X_saAIETRHgpECi8YA Overall a small strip mall restaurant with a few tables.  Came for Taco Tuesday happy hour at 3:30pm (the HH starts at 3pm) - it was very uncrowded. $1.50 street tacos (short rib, octopus and pulled pork) were great. The octopus was my least favorite, and wound up ordering another short rib taco - but overall the tacos were very good. The $5 wine was good too. Came away for under $12, which is pretty darn cheap for the quality of food I got. I recommend this place especially for happy hour.
