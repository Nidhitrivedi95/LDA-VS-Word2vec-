7m1Oa1VYV98UUuo_6i0EZg Amazing place. My wife and I came here are watching it be featured on DDD. It did not disappoint. 

We each had a burger. I had the country fried Bruges. Amazing! My wife had the green chili sauces burger. Amazing!!

The tots were top notch. Service was excellent. This place is in a strip mall but don't let that discourage you from coming. We have been back 3 times in the last 3 weeks and always consistently amazing!!
