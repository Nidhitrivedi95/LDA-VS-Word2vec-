I was slightly worried when the nachos were nearly $18 but I was already in the restaurant and starving. My daughter ordered a burrito and said she'd like to taste a few bites of nachos when they came. Her food came out first and I was slightly irritated the food didn't come out together-10 minutes later this huge thing arrived--holy cow! 

I had no idea it would be this massive. I wish she would have said something when I ordered, no wonder they were pricey. But I guess if this is the only size of nachos-I would have ordered it anyway. 

It was pretty good...not my favorite platter of nachos--but they were good. They have a salsa bar with various salsas which is a nice touch. I plove that all the food is organic and stuff-really speaks to my crunchy granola side. My daughter liked her burrito. 
We were stuffed-didn't look like we ate much, but we did. If you have a massive group of kids that want nachos--head over this way. Friendly staff. Tasty food
