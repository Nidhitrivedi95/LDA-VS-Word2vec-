Kid's meal was a small tortilla with melted cheese inside and half a plate of spring mix salad that I don't think many kids would eat.  My son is only 2.5 and normally he eats half a kids meal, this time I had to feed him when he got home.  

Overall are bill was about $20 higher than usual and the quality of the food wasn't as good.  Not sure what happened but we definitely won't go back.
