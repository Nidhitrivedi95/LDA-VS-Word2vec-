Dj8MfG5-UGbjp9GxaNnGxQ First off we were sat right away. Very polite and friendly hostess. The server was so sweet. She waited on us and made sure we were taken care of. Great service!! Now the food is a slightly different story lol. While it all tasted good it definitely was not what we thought we had ordered. The beef brisket tacos are actually pulled pork like tacos that even come with BBQ sauce. Mind you without the sauce they're very good. Cold but good. We ordered the "green pig" quest dip. It's just melted orange cheese with a crap ton of tomatoes, chilies, and what was supposed to be chorizo was more like hamburger meat. It was not very good and definitely not worth the almost $8 for it. The chips and salsa is complimentary and very good. Not super chunky but nice kick. The watermelon margarita was divine (my husband ordered it) and said it was good and strong lol. The fajitas were lacking and had pulled pork like meat, 4 little strips of could be steak, a couple grilled shrimp and 4 little strips of grilled chicken. Not worth even half what we paid for it and won't order it again. All in all the service was superb and we will be back to try new things. Fingers crossed!!!
