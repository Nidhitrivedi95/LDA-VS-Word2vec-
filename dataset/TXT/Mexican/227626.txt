S3qs5ZAZgqDvM88jj17hbQ My very first thought is to ask for Noe to serve you. He is easily the best waiter we have had in a very long time. When we were finished our meal I called over the manager to tell him how great the service was.   The manager was so gracious and extremely happy to hear his server is terrific.  He actually treated us to a round of drinks - what a lovely surprise!
The decor in here is a lot of fun, The music is good and the food is well priced. Our portions were absolutely huge.  You are immediately given warm nacho chips with salsa when you get served.   We started our meal with jalapeno poppers and a couple of cold beers.   I had beef enchiladas with the mole sauce & a salad, he had 2 really good Blue Demon soft tacos (huge shrimp in a tequila sauce) with Mexican rice that he really thought was good.
It was actually our first time here, we will absolutely come again. It's just a great atmosphere to have a cold beer and a taco :-)
