Ns20WGWn6s6niKAGIQB4UQ I've only been here for drinks and a bite to eat. I love the location and I love the ambiance of the place, it's really great vibes. As far as the food goes though, it's just ok. The bar is amazing and they have an amazing selection of craft beer which I love. Our server was so laidback and super cool, he made the experience memorable. 

I'd definitely come back for evening events and cocktails but probably not to eat.
