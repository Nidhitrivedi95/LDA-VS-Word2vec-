7CzA5GqrELLJyRoaJQhlGA We love Morenos! The owner Angel is a really friendly guy, the staff does a good job and the food is good Mexican food at Super reasonable prices!

We have eaten at a few locations of theirs and this is sure to become one of your new favorite spots!

This location is not really set up for groups, use their Broadway and Horne location in Mesa or the Gilbert location for bigger groups.
