qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A DW Bistro! I always have a great time when I come. I have always wanted to do their sunday brunch, so that is in the making.
The wait time is always reasonable and they are very apologetic but who can blame them... DW is the best! Their drinks and bar tenders are delightful and I am not lying when I say everything on their menu is fantastic. 

My favorite is their Jerk Chicken, and their Turkey burger!!! Always quality, great prices, and phenomenal food. Their chopped salad is also so amazing, its like deconstructed with the most perfect elements and portions. Their drink selection however is incredible. I love their mimosas, and weird mixed drink varieties.

However... on Sundays everyone is so rude and it's like a fire hazard. I had called around 11:30 AM to take my sister to brunch and they said no problem. Then I was faced with a confusing ass line then told to go to the front door where I was greeted by a super rude guy in a captain america outfit who told me they weren't taking anymore guests for the next 1.5-2 hours..... WHY COULDN'T THEY TELL ME THAT ON THE PHONE? SO RUDE.
