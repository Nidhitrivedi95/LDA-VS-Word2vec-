Pw06ajii6di7QHYpj6IgkQ I have gone enough that I feel I can give this location a decent review. My main problem is there isn't much consistency. For example... tonight my burrito was awful. 

Overall, the serving area is pretty tidy. I usually go at busy times so it could be worse. But there's sometimes certain foods that have made their way into other bins and it's not a good call for people like me who can't eat onions to all of a sudden have an onion in their rice!

The portions are good, I'm always full. But again, sometimes you get barely any of a certain topping and other times it's overwhelming. Tonight for example... I feel anyone who adds jalapeños is expecting a teaspoon's worth on a small or medium. I bet I had a freaking tablespoon on a small. I couldn't even finish and thoroughly didn't enjoy it. 

What really boggles my mind... my server today placed the ingredients and started wrapping. He saw that the salsa was on half and the burrito sauce was on the other half.. yet he wrapped it up. I asked for the second (not for me) to be wrapped a different way... he tried to move the ingredients around but I don't think he really cared much for his job and didn't wrap it the way I suggested.

I don't know what to say about this place... would I go back... yea because when it's good it's really really good. But when it's bad, it's really disappointing.
