K-uQkfSUTwu5LIwPB4b_vg First time in with my fiancé. Saw how people raved about it so we decided to try it and see what the hype was all about. For me, the most important thing about a restaurant is the first impression. We walk up to the hostess and she asked if we had a reservation, of course we planned this last minute so we said no. She immediately made a face that was not pretty. A face that someone makes when they don't want to do extra work. We now are standing waiting for a response when she calls 2 other hostesses to help her look at availability on her computer. Um ok? They finally figure out where to put us (two people) and let us know that it will be a ten minute wait. We agree and wait. Ended up waiting 45 minutes to get seated. At last, we are put in a corner outside with no Air Conditioner....(take note it's hot as heck) We decide to just brush it off and wait to see if the food is worth it. We order our food and got it pretty fast. Took us about 10 minutes to eat our small taco plate. The waiter Noah was great none the less. Tacos were ok. Didn't care for them but, what was delicious was the fresh guacamole and the churros dessert. Overall, waiter and some of the food was why I give this place 3 stars. I will not refer this place to anyone of my friends or family.
