7-Ba9uSmYYpXgnQRoIPxMQ My friend from Nicaragua would always rave how good & flavorful the food is at Havana Grill. We decided to go for dinner here tonight. We sat at the bar were the bartender by the name of Carlos not only gave us great customer service, but also good after dinner dessert recommendations. I ordered a Mojito, but it was just a little too sweet for my liking. I had to ask for an extra lime wedge, to help adjust the level of sweetness. As for dinner, I just went by what my Nicaraguan friend ordered,  Beef Padilla with Black Beans & Rice. Delicious & cooked to order!! Nice bold flavors with grilled onions & garlic!! We ordered plantains for dessert. The plantains were a delight & my after dinner coffee was exquisite!! It came with a lady finger cookie on the side!! I am eager to come back for happy hour!! The croquetas looked very tasty & on my "next to try" list.
