Wht6JaY_yLIb3usuPvSulA We came in on a Sunday morning, well to start the parking here sucks!! The place was clean, the service was ok, but the food was disappointing. Everything kind of just thrown together, there was no effort in it I guess you can say. The ceviche de camarón was salty as hell! The cerveza preparada was a bust and the waitresses looked and sounded like they didn't want to be there taking your order.  Probably wouldn't be back.
