UFVy-8WC7pDzvBUzOvdwzA It has been years since I have been to this location and tonight was somewhat disappointing since my last review.
Service was VERY slow!
I ordered the chicken fajitas. What Mexican restaurant doesn't serve fajitas in a sizzling platter??? The chicken, onions and peppers came on a plate with beans and rice. Unfortunately everything was like warm. The sizzling platter would have kept everything warm. Needless to say I enjoyed the salsa and margarita, but definitely was underwhelmed with the food.
Too many other better Mexican restaurants out there, but is a good spot for mediocre food.
