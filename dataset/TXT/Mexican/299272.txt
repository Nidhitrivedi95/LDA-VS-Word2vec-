ZkUWOdBA4T7pdUhT0dkRzQ This is the second Barrio Queen I have been to in AZ. This one was just as good. The atmosphere in dowtown Gilbert is very nice. We were able to sit out on the patio and enjoy a nice AZ evening. The food came out very fast, was delicious and large portions! The staff was nice, friednly and helpful with menu questions. I reccomend any of their burritos! Excited to go back for taco tuesday!
