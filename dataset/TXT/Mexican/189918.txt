OD09pm-MzynigAvD5KoGPA Found this place online and decided to check it out.  The place is on the smaller size but the food was very fresh. I ordered the burrito and they have have many different choices for protein. The salsa was on the spicy side which I like but if you don't like spicy be careful.
