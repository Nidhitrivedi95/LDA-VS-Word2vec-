bU6IZNKS7NcFVfZppkTHAg ok, the simple fact that I have been the mayor of Cozumel on four-square should tell the whole story. I love this place, awesome food, great salsa, perfect carry-out for a lazy sunday or a late night at work. I knew I called in orders to often when Pedro, (the usual manager) stopped asking for the name on my carry out orders and just said "ok mike, ill see you in 10 min." 

That being said, the place could use a little bit of updating, that would be the only reason I cant give it a perfect review. heres the explanation, I im reviewing it for what it "is" I would go 5 stars, i understand its a low cost great food Mexican joint and thats all good. but as a business ingeneral, it could use some updating and therefor I have to say 4 stars.

IF YOU HAVE'NT TRIED IT YET YOU SHOULD!!!!
