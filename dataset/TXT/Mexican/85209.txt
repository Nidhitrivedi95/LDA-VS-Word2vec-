dAcaMSkrpYUZocqrLvOzRQ You blink, and you'll miss it. Tiny place in the middle of a block of different stores. Don't let that deter you from trying it out!
Enchilada - fairly plain but I thought the sauce was mixed well with the spices; nice mini kick.
California burrito - humongous and full of flavor! Definitely a stuffed burrito.
Surf n Turf taco - YUMMY!! Balanced perfectly with toppings to meat.
Fish taco - I wasn't 100% sure about the hype surrounding this taco; while good, it didn't "wow" me enough to talk about it. I think the Surf n Turf blew the fish out of the water! (ha)
Carne Asade fries - dang good! I have never had anything of the sort (usually it'd be chips, not fries underneath all the goodies). Definitely recommend. 
You do get a basket of chips and a small thing of salsa while you wait for your food. (Surprisingly good salsa).
