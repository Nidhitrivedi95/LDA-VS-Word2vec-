u1m3qTIrhZhwNjMT6n-M8g My hubby and I have been on the hunt for good Mexican food and margaritas since we moved to AZ from CA. Seriously, we have tried 6 other restaurants that have all been hugely disappointing. Finally we have found our place. To be honest, we were a little reluctant to try this place due to the outside appearance. I'm so happy that we gave it a chance. The food is so yummy and I can finally say I've found a delicious margarita in AZ!
