GC5wcui5uejRZTi8OCNPkQ I have been eating here for over a year, and the food is great, for the most part. I love the chicken fajitas, and the enchiladas. But, I really like the service!  I always ask for a certain server, if she is working that night... Celina is the BEST!!  Great service always!  So, good food and GREAT service...that's why I come back time and time again.
