R68SX1-FFLvv6BqsK9-Alw Just ate at So Cal fish tacos with my girlfriend. We both thought the tacos were excellent along with the sides of rice and beans. She had one complaint, which I didn't think about until she brought it up. From a purely recyclable point of view, it would be nice if not all of the food containers are throw away plastic. That being said, the place it great with a cool vibe.
