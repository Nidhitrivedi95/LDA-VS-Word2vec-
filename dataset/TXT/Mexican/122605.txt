HGLMe4y0y_VsBkDLdpfBLA Papi Chulos is one of my favourite places,  Everything is just wonderful - food, service, ambiance.
The Guacamole, Street Tacos and Arrachera Steak are to die for.  The ceviche was the best I've ever had.  The food was served in a timely manner, and was delicious.  I have been to many Mexican restaurant in Phoenix/Scottsdale area, but none quit as good as Papi Chulo's 
Daniel is a great waiter (friendly,attentive and knowledgeable) and so are the other waiters too, everyone is so great and we love coming back time after time.
