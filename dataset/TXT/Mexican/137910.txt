IUv-dRWHyds6ncxqVcxpGQ Went to tru taco on the initial opening week and I was excited for a new place to eat lunch. I was met by the owner  in line who was explaining the menu, seemed friendly along with the staff...the menu looked promising as well with a Mexican - Asian fusion and unique ingredients...but once I got my bowl, it was bland, the rice was not fresh and this is important because its the base of the meal. I was pretty disappointed
