yKShDxZcD-9UtqvtZfdWqw This store is usually good however tonight my husband & I got carry out and the rice was hardly done. I called to let them know & the girl was completely clueless on how to handle a customer complaint. She just said sorry and have a good day. They offered to remake them but we're at home, getting ready to leave town. Not in the plans to go back at this hour...
