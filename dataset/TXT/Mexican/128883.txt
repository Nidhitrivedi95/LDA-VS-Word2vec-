I22wQGTkLFGn6jTOhwoecQ I came to this place after looking at the sign for the best Carne asada fries in town everyday for 3 months. Finally decided to try and let's just say that they are not the best Carne asada fries In town. They used nacho cheese for the the topping cheese! Any self respecting Mexican restaurant would not use nacho cheese on top of Carne asada fries. Plus the service was not that great either. I entered in when nobody was there. Right after me 5 people arrived. I ordered first but three of the people got their food way before mine. Will not be returning here
