L2iT7pipc455Tgpbo35_mw Checked this place out a few nights ago. Since it's spring break at ASU, I imagine every bar on Mill was nowhere near capacity. This place had a smallish, chill crowd with a relaxed vibe. I imagine when all the students get back, that could change. I thought the layout was nice, with a prominent bar smack in the center. Ordering drinks was easy and the bartenders were laid back. I'd definately give this place another visit.
