PQWE8a6Opjiuzt7DaX2R6Q This place is a good bet for decent happy hour food and drinks at good prices.  I came a little after 9:30 on a week night and it was not busy, but there were a few tables in the bar area. The server was attentive, polite and food came out hot and quick. Can't say it's the most authentic Mexican food, nor the very best, but it certainly has a place in the world and I will be back. The patio is nice too.
