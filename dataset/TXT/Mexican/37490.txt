5t9kTG9DakuamJgY65HA7w really  dirty had to walk in and move a garden hose that was at front entrance.  no ac on ...it is currently  103 outside.  salsa had no flavor,  quesdilla  was ok, Spanish rice had old plastic taste and Margarita  was marginal.   service was little and only if you flagged her down.
