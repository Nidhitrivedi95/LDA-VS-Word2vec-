OD09pm-MzynigAvD5KoGPA The. Best. Tacos. Hands down. This small hole in the wall taco shop packs a lot of flavor into each dish. I usually get the burrito bowl or tacos, but they have a variety of food including wet burritos and breakfast burritos. 

The prices are great and the portions are big! Extra bonus: They have a killer salsa bar with 5-6 salsas, unlimited limes and a couple different pepper mixes. Worth the stop!
