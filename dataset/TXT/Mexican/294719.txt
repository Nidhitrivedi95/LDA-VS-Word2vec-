z9KxcVoe6tQGyB_Zy0Umcg Attention all my Arizona people! Are you sitting down? Well sit down! I'm going to brag to you about a new place i just found up the street. It's called Mv Snacks. It's all about Mexican style sushi and snacks. I saw this place last weekend and I had a hunch that it was going to be good. Man was I right! And what an understatement! The food was great and the concept is original. The place was clean and the employees were friendly.
I had a chance to meet the owner. She has good business acumen and she's sharp. But lest you get the idea that she's new to the business think again. She's been catering for close to half a decade. And the proof is in the product. Check out my photos but most importantly give them a try!
And remember, you heard it here first!
