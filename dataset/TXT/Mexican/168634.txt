Lvg2y48cv7xFUJBqoUXmvw I just ordered the 3 taco lunch special, which comes with refried beans and rice for $6.99. I was not impressed. I was greasy and weird. They use hot sauce instead of salsa. and the taco shells were mushy. The refried beans were pureed. Not the worst I've had, but you could definitely do a LOT better in Madison. Next time, I'll be back at La Hacienda on Park or Laredo's in Madison (east) or Fitchburg (west).
