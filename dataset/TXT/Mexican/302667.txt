zwNC-Ow4eIMan2__bS9-rg I've always heard of this place on the radio so I was looking forward to coming. When you walk in its not very inviting. When trying to order no one acknowledges you. When you finally have someone helping you, you have to repeat your order about three times. The place on where they cook and cut the meat is disgustingly dirty. I ask for my tacos with cilantro and onion. I get my tacos with just onion because they didn't want to cut up fresh cilantro. Overall very disappointed with the service and food. Never coming back!
