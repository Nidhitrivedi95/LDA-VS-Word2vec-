nKwpOxc4p6_fv7f0gOhyhQ Absolutely generic and disappointing food, all dressed up with nowhere to go.  Bland, overpriced, and sometimes  just bad or odd combinations (trout in a fish taco was rank). The 'Ceviche' they serve was completely unrelated to ceviche, just a few raw slices of fish that weren't even marinated in anything, and some corn to make it 'Mexican'.. Overpriced joke.

Seems like the restaurant was just cashing in on the upscale Mexican trend without any of the chefs or owners having ever visited Mexico.  A taco at even the most basic taco truck in NYC or elsewhere is filled with way more pop and flavour than anything found here. 

Wait staff was clueless when we arrived, seating us first at the bar, then at the back, then back at the bar, then made us move three seats over even though during out whole meal the place was virtually empty. Very odd. 

Bartender was very nice, and the only reason I don't give this place one star.
