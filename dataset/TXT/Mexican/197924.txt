p-w6g8cuQq5PU_4U1XNCzQ We were traveling through and found this little gem.  The food was great and the service was helpful and kind.  The meal begins with chips and two kinds of salsas.  The dishes were tasty.  My son ordered a plate with three hard shell tacos.  The tacos were soggy from the beans.  I told her I needed new shells and she went back to the kitchen and brought back three freshly fried shells.  Delicious!

We ordered two medium margaritas.  They were huge.  The drinks were strong too.  We probably should have shared a small. 

Will look forward to returning here the next time we're in town!
