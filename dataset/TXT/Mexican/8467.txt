_rXRnGcU3RFtsehmdL0ucw We had a delicious dinner.  Their Mango Salad is incredibly great and the corn bread that comes with it is just delightful. We had excellent service, and we had two full meals and drinks for less than $25.  We also had their fish tacos which were perfectly cooked.  The restaurant was clean and we did not have to wait during dinner rush.  Our meal was served hot and in a timely manner.  We will definitely visit Rosa's again and again.
