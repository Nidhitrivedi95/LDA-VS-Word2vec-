EC7NrIHKk6i3US_XJlDWDA Went to this place today for lunch and had the lunch special (D), Pollo Magnifico.  The plate comes with rice and beans as sides, and the entree is a deep fried chicken burrito with a jalapeño cream cheese, and cheese topping.  I really enjoyed the Pollo Magnifico, but the rice was slightly over cooked and a little mushy, and the beans were over cooked and dry. You get free chips and salsa with your meal. The chips were fresh and the salsa was good. The place has a typical taco stand, cheesy atmosphere, but the service was friendly. Overall I would say this place deserves 3.5 stars, but that's not an option, so I will be kind and give it 4 stars.
