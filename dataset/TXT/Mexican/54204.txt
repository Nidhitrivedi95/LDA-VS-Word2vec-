9RKjjuTQYkYpGmCtfVsTZQ Absolutely delicious - choose from burrito, fajita, quesadilla etc., choose your filling, then choose how hot you want it to be. Ready in minutes, very generous sizes, and quite unique in Edinburgh. There's even a loyalty card scheme you can collect stamps on to go towards another meal. They also sell Mexican sauces and spices behind the counter. The staff are very friendly and always trying to make their business even better - wish I still lived close by so I could frequent here more often, however delivery is always an option!
