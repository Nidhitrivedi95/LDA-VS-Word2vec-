ITOa1olD2HTgEVOnH8zVog Just finished the whitest Mexican food in AZ. If you think white bread is too spicy and flavorful then this place is for you. Chips were stale with no salt, guac had no onion, tomatoes or flavor of any kind. Enchiladas were chicken cube burritos swimming in sauce. Sucks because it looks like a cute little place with nice patio but would not come back
