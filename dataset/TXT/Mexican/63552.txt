b-0q4xbL6EWYUqnwqcYM4Q My favorite Mexican restaurant of all times;  from Cali to Texas and back home to NC, this place is still my favorite.   The cheese dip is one-of-a-kind & the special nachos (I prefer chicken) are a meal all by themselves.

Service is normally good, but peak times, like any place, can be a little slow.  I prefer this location but the University is good too (and bigger).
