frwKRRIIR0QMv25IKVDIMA This was our first time. Being a Pullano's fan made me hopeful. Bonita's did not disappoint. The place was clean and nice. I would probably turn something else on the TV-( Soap operas are not my thing.) My husband had the carne Asada burrito with rice and beans. I had the taco salad with ground beef. The cheese was really good. Not synthetic cheese like most places. All Meat and no filler made both of these dishes delicious.  Chips were good. Had the habenero salsa-really good. Hot salsa was like a taco sauce.  We will definitely return!!
