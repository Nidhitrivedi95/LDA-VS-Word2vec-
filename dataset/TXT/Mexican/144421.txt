JEQaPs7jNT1M2os9lJDlUA I am sorry to have to write a review like this for a local restaurant.  I am vegan.  I had a lunch reservation for Coronado Cafe, but decided to call ahead of time to work out any kinks in the preparation (e.g., no butter, no refined sugar, no smuggled in eggs or milk or cheese).  When I called, I thought I was lucky to have reached the owner.  I was quickly disabused.  She quipped that I should have taken the time to look up their menu online.  (By the way, of course I had, but they don't label!)  When I told her that the menu doesn't tell me everything I need to know for my diet (e.g., the butter or sugar issue), she got really exasperated and whined, "I'm trying to help you."  I said that was great and I'd like the help.  She then said that they have several vegetarian items, which again I explained might not be vegan (a vegan diet is more restrictive, so just because it's vegetarian does not necessarily mean it's vegan).  I asked her, for example, to ask the chef if the veggie burger was vegan, and she said,  "I'm the owner and I know everything about the menu."  So I asked her if the veggie burger was vegan and she said, "I don't know.  Is a veggie burger vegan?"  I said, "Some are; some aren't."  She said, "I don't think this is a place for you.  Don't come."  I didn't.  And I won't ever.  

To sum up:  The owner is rude, unhelpful, unknowledgeable about food -- and to top it all off, she refuses to talk to the chef (who could easily answer food prep questions).  Two thumbs down; two thumbs way down.
