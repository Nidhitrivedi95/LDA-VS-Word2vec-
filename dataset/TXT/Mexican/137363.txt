iSmQkgaSE36nzctelDq-cg I'm bummed I hadn't tried this place before. The pupusas were delicious, they're a good size not overly greasy and the fillings were very tasty. My wife went crazy over the platano empanadas, they're a must try if you enjoy platano macho. The service was quick and courteous and the restaurant itself is very clean.
