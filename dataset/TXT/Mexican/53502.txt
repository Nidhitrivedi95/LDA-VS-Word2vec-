9pWzjhdrPgsZEmF7-QOaIQ Ate here a few times as it is just across the street from my condo building and rather convenient, but I just can't get behind the tacos here.  It's too bad, because if they were decent I would be in here all the time! 

The menu is averagely priced for a taco but the tacos themselves are nothing special. The meat is usually dry and flavourless, the toppings lacklustre and the corn tortillas often a little soggy. 

I would say save your appetite and head over to Kensington Market to have a taco at Seven Lives Tacquiera where the fillings are abundant and the food is much more creative at the same price.
