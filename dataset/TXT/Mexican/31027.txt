4enw_5SjmPuVpxg8MhbPBw I really enjoyed the daily special. It is a great deal. There are many options and the food does not take much time to be ready.
I went last night for dinner and had the platter. Great to have rice and beans with your meal.
My friend had the chicken quesadilla and it was good to see that was nicely grilled and enough cheese in it.

Will be back for sure
