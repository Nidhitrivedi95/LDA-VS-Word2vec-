pzy9xWQqsDxVU6j9MktRJg This is probably the WORST customer service I have EVER received. Called and made a reservation for 15 on Thursday for tonight. They wrote it down for the complete wrong date. They then refused to seat us until our whole party was here even though THEY messed up our reservation. They told us they had a table for us and then gave it away even though they told us it was available for us. The woman at the host stand yelled at the host who told us our table was available in Spanish saying they couldn't seat us without everyone here and we were only missing one person. We have been here over an hour and still have not been sat and have had all of our party for 45 minutes. Bar service is awful as well. The guy totally forgot two of our drinks and didn't listen when we told us to split it. Never coming back and still haven't even eaten.
Edit: just ordered and my quesadilla came an hour later and wasn't good at all and my boyfriend's order was completely incorrect. No point in sending them back because they'll just spit in it. Never coming back.
