Had the Veggie Tacos, which were amazing, and a side of fries with the Spicy Russian and Malt Aioli sauces, the Spicy Russian was their take on a thousand island based sauce, and was very good. Washed it down with a Uinta Hop Nosh, which they had on tap, and happy hour half-off pricing. Tacos and fries were great, staff was super attentive, and the food was great. 

Only complaint from me was that it's a little tough to find parking right now, but I imagine that the construction next door has a lot to do with that.
