SXWLhxdcFCLPnF7AlFbg4g I have eaten here a few times, and always enjoy my meal, but I have to echo the comments of the other reviewers; the service needs improvement. Just recently we went on a Sunday evening at around 5:30. 

We were fortunate in that our order went in just before a large takeout order was placed, as we watched other tables that came in after us wait for about 45 minutes to receive their food (and some even longer). 

We actually managed to place our order, eat, and finish before a table (which came in just shortly after us) had even received their meal. The trouble is I can't seem to figure out where the fault lies. The servers seem to have trouble even retrieving drinks for tables, while the kitchen staff seems to have trouble with large orders. 

I realize this is a fairly new restaurant, and maybe they are still trying to find their groove, but I hope for their sake that they find some synergy soon.

Also, if you're reading any of these reviews before going, I should let you know this is a fairly small restaurant, and bringing small children is probably not the best idea. We sat behind a table with small children who seemed to want to explore and roam around the restaurant. When servers are buzzing around as busy as they were last night, this is a recipe for disaster.
