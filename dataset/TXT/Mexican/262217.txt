vxFrGfeQCtc5AzPKkMHHgA This place is 100% not worth a visit. The tacos were subpar and overly salty. The worst part, however, was the atrocious service. It took 20 minutes for our table of 5 to receive drinks, we had vegetarians at our table who got meat in their tacos, and we were overcharged at the end of the meal. The only reason is gets two stars is because their margaritas were pretty good. It's best to go with the menu options instead of create your own, but they were strong and not overly sweet.
