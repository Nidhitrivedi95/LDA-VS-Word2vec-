Jy40ercZIQaNcz2qV3qgow I love a margarita! Usually when I treat myself to one I get a hard time when I ask for it frozen. If fact most places will try to talk me out of it! I came in asked for it and got it no problem! In fact, the bartender "Rachel" gave me the glass with the little bit extra! It's those little things that matter to me! I wasn't hungry, but my husband and I didn't get a hard time when we decided to split a burrito, in fact they split it for us! It's not the best thing I've ever tasted, but it's o.k. I think if they improved on the food a bit and kept this service I would hate it here because they were to busy! Lol!
