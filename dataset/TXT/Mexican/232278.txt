Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg Wow! I frequent the Lindo Michoacan in Henderson that I live right by, but I stopped at this location for lunch while I was in the area. Let me start by saying that being from the Bay Area in California, I am a hard judge of authentic Mexican food, and I rarely ever find restaurants out of California that live up to my expectations. This location on Desert Inn of Lindo exceeded my expectations by far! First off, the service was amazing. Got sat right away, ambience was great and reminded me of my favorite Mexican restaurant in California that went out of business. Their chips and salsa are to die for--I mean seriously, like the best salsa I have ever had. They bring bean dip too. The lunch specials are amazing as well. This visit, I ordered the Chile Verde lunch special for only like $9, and my iced tea was included in this price (score!), and it was seriously the BEST Chile Verde I have ever had. Normally, I stray away from ordering this dish at restaurants I have not been to, but this was just ridiculous. When I typically order it, there's fat on the meat. In this case? Nope, not one bit. So so tender and delicious. Their corn tortillas are incredible too. My server Miguel was awesome! I hope to get him next time I come in. He offered great suggestions and was attentive and very friendly. He even gave me a tip on what to order next time I am in! Thanks Lindo Michoacan, I'm so glad I finally found the best Mexican in Las Vegas.
