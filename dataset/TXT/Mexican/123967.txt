HnQVDNGFWOS5zle0dhpOkw My husband and I used to come here a lot since we found out about this place in 2013, though we never really made effort to write a review until year later. My husband really liked this place because they didn't used to use lard. We originally gave this place a 4 star but now were back to give it a 2 star. This place has gone downhill. I believe they now have a new management/owner. An employee upfront told us they now use lard. Fajita mix was removed from the choices of fillers and prices went up as well. Now they have added the option to be able to tip the employees which we don't mind really. But there is a new employee there an elder lady who talks with so much enthusiasm (trying too hard really) right when you pull up to the drive thru window to sign your receipt with a dollar and some change to tip her, she just gives you the look and change the tone of her voice.
Lady if you don't want the $1.XX tip over a $7.xx bill, we don't have to give it you know.
