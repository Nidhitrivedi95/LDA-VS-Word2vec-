57dbqYYLpyvTH5RRKkIWrg As not the place itself that bothers me being an excellent location but the employees (horrible!)
First their is this one guy with his gut hanging out his taco bell shirt (always) / everyone else except the girls looks literally like they are on drugs. 
Taco Bell should be an in and out affair, not regretting it since replacing your order.
