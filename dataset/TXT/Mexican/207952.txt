qcP9AhS2tAM_oAjZ_o7U4g After reading many negative reviews, I was extremely skeptical to try this restaurant. However, I had a great experience!

I went for lunch, and for 12$ I had a chili burrito, soup, salad and coffee. Not a bad deal. The burrito and soup were both delicious. It wasn't too busy since it was lunch time, and we had good service.

Also love the decor and music.
