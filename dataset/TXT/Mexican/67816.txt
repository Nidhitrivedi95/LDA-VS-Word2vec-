BHMqFvtguSDrZLQPtjZSuA This place is just Okay. It's close to my house so I've eaten here quite a few times. The best items I've had are the breakfast burritos, they actually are pretty good and available all day.

My biggest issue with this place is the meat. When you order something with meat on it, they do put a lot on there but, its just not that good. The chicken is always tough, stringy and chewy. The carnitas is an odd consistency, more like chipped beef, not like the shredded/pulled pork consistency it should be and its very greasy. The carne asada is tough but the best meat option (besides the bacon) in my opinion.

The pico de gallo is mostly cilantro, way too much for my tastes but if you like cilantro you'll love their pico.
