Voeq7aGDmCGMjE_SQiHwRA We stopped in for lunch yesterday on the way to shopping at the strip. Some of the surrounding spots don't open for lunch on Saturday , but if you are in or near town, you will be glad that Bakersfield does. I have been there several times previously, during week hours, and wanted to bring my family. 
We were greeted and seated by our friendly and competent waiter 'Chris', who provided stellar service throughout the meal. 
Our table ordered chips and guacamole to start. Guac was super fresh and very tasty. Next came the meal. Bakersfield tacos are small, but priced accordingly which is great because you can try a variety. I had a fish and also a pollo taco, both were outstanding - very fresh and delicious. My wife and I also tried some soup for the first time. It was called Pozole, and I highly recommend it. It had braised pork, chicken, In a tomatillo broth with hominy dumplings. Complex and tasty flavors. 
Atomsphere at Bakersfield is also nice. Everyone seemed to be enjoying the food. Lots of liquor offerings and music was pleasant. 
Definitely recommend.
