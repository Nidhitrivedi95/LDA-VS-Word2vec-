FutUAQPBfCeTmqytfDW1pA Food quality is top shelf, but the staff undoubtedly RUINS the experience. They are consistently under-staffed, so you'll wait 15+ minutes on average. Once you order, you'll be lucky to have them speak to you, rather it's an eye contact followed by pissed glance meaning your cue to indicate beef or chicken. Today the effervescent cashier tried to cram 3 hard shell tacos in a small bag, then told me "absolutely not" to my request to use a handled bag. Clearly the cream of the crop for hired help. Nevertheless, it's chipotle food so it's Delish! Just don't expect anyone with a fraction of a personality to be there to make you some lunch...
