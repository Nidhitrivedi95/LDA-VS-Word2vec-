TH6mQqMfKATGjuW9SfoVSg Highly Disappointing. The meat served here is made on a griddle. Authentic Carne Asada is made on a GRILL!! Thats what Asada means in spanish, made on a GRILL! This saddens me to the point I will never return.  

What I am saying my fellow Yelpers, when you order Carne Asada thats what you expect. In all honesty, the carne asada served here is cheap imitation.
