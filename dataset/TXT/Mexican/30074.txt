46hnat0aLao-qYWZkN9aBg I had never been to the location off of Central and it had been years since I've eaten at the Mesa location.  The red salsa is mighty tasty/spicy and it's almost worth the trip for it alone.  My friend and I ate three servings.  For lunch I enjoyed the carne adovada and the beans/rice which I normally don't even eat at other Mexican restaurants.  The atmosphere is very comfortable and goes with the long history of the building. Highly recommended
