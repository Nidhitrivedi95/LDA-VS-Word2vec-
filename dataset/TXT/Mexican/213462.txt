QWbP1vKQOFjN-6pr0-78zQ Ok so I give them between 2-3 stars. I went ahead and gave them 3 here.
I like things and I dislike things about this place... What I LIKE and why I came here twice was the food is actually REALLY good... Better than the other Don Tortaco I live by. This location makes better Vegetarian burritos. They make REALLY good carne asada tacos, the corn tortilla they use is bigger and like homemade. Chili relleno burrito is SoOoo GooD!  Both times I went food was great...As far as I can tell the people who work there are very nice too.

Dislikes: They take forever!!  I have waited like ten minutes in the drive through and I was the only car. I wouldn't care if they took their time and the order was right but the second time we came we waited HELLA long , drove all the way home to find no cheese quesadilla... Drove back. Really annoying. 

Otherwise, the food is great. I don't mind waiting for it. Just get the order correct and I will feed from this place like a kitten suckling guacamole from its' mother's green tic-tacs.
