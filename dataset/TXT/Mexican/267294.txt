wjf1uZNr6E4LQ0nUNHX5AA Nothing but disappointed w this place, this is the Third time coming to this place and "the grill isn't working"?? I'm good off this place, either invest in new equipment to provide the services your advertising ( selling food) or stop stereotyping customers based on appearance or your perception of their appearance. If your scared of customers that don't look like you, get a dog! Third time and I'm done, I will not patronize this business any more no matter how "bomb the food is" your customer service sucks.
