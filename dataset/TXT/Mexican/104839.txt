Fho2P7OP80-yChCRxkK7Hw This is a commendation for the guy working the drive thru window.  I called when I got home to compliment, and found out his name is Albert.  At the moment I drove up, I was greeted and advised it would be a moment. When he came back to the speaker, he genuinely apologized for the wait and thanked me for my patience.  He took my order, verified it, and when I got to the window to pay, he had a smile as genuine as his voice.  I don't know if this is the training Del Taco provides, or if this guy Albert is just a spectacular person, but this experience won me over for life. As I told his GM Johnny, you don't encounter service like this at a fine dining restaurant, let alone at a fast food drive through. This young man is destined for greatness and I just couldn't let this experience go unmentioned.  I was sincerely touched and impressed by his attitude and service.  In addition, my bacon, chicken, avocado salad was AWESOME. I know this is fast food, but it was quality ingredients, nicely put together, and tasty. The cilantro dressing is just so good.
