Nb3hAuv8OkpFgSImYdt3Rg Chipotle is know for it's huge burritos.  The one I just got here was the smallest Chipotle burrito I have ever seen, and when I mentioned it's sub-compact size to the cashier, she blew me off.

The Twinsburg Chipotle is very clean, the staff is friendly and it's conveniently located.  But, if you're hungry, I suggest you head to the one in Hudson or Northfield.
