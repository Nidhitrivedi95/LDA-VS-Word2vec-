P6c0lV9DeJ6ofntpTWyqhA This place is actually quite good, for a literal corner spot restaurant. The wonderful family that runs it is beyond nice and goes above and beyond for service. 

The food is very delicious. 6 stars if they had the option. Enchiladas are my favorite. I also am in love with the carne asada.... so good.
