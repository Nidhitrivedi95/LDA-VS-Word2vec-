5onric5Vkk9bkN0z7hmeFA I went to Chico's when I saw they had free kids meals. When i got there I saw a sign that said kids meals 99 cents with adult dinner. It was lunch time so my husband and I ordered off the lunch menu and we ordered for both kids. Didn't really care for the food. The kids like theirs. I didn't like the cheese sauce they smothered over my taco. Time  for the bill they charged us full price for both kids meals. One would think the waiter would have stated the kids would be full price if you ordered from the lunch menu. If we would have known that my husband and I would have simply shared a mean and the kids would have shared one too. Bad communication on the restaurant's part. I will not be returning. They left a sour note in my mouth.
