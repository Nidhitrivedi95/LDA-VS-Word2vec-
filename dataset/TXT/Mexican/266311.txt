It's sad that this place is almost hidden away in a corner because it's the first and maybe only example of solid mexican food anywhere in the area. Fresh chips and salsas greet you as you await your order.

Grabbed a beef burrito and a trio of chicken tacos. Very agreeable but lacking spice options. I hear their beer-battered haddock tacos are a crowd-pleaser.

I'll certainly go back, and if they could land a liqour license and a patio, I'd probably go every week.
