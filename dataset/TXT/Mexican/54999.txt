9vub2LM7Djy8P-LPumcLXA Took my family here after reading all the good reviews and I gotta say the food was amazing!!! I want to go back for more already and they will definitely be seeing me a few times a week from now on. The meat was delicious, salsa was perfect, the corn tortillas were yummy and the bean soup was A1! Horchata was good too! New favorite
