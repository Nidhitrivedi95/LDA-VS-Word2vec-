-o082vExIs0VVNSuZmiTQA We came here a few years ago and it was decent and decided to go for dinner last night since it had been forever.  Won't be coming back - waiter did not come to the table for about 8 min, which was odd because the place was not packed yet.  We were hoping to get an order in before happy hour ended but no dice. Took drink orders, got drinks in a reasonable time, waiter came back in a decent amount of time to take orders.  Food arrived and the waiter walked away - they didn't come back to ask if we needed anything or whatnot, still, they weren't that busy.  Our drinks were empty and we really would have liked some water or another drink but no dice.  We ordered the chicken poblano enchiladas... there were maybe 5  chunks of chicken in mine and the chicken was super chewy/lumpy, like over cooked shrimp consistency, essentially we got cheese enchiladas covered in sauce.  Some random person brought water when we were finishing our food, the waiter grabbed our plates and brought the check.  All and all it wasn't a horrible experience but definitely won't be coming back or recommending.
