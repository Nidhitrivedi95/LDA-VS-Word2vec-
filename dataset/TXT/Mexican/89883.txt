DuQtouEXOfo5K4ukON3qwQ We've been going to La Restia now for the last 2 years. The food is always good with a diverse menu and a staff that are top notch. Owners John and Andrea  love chatting with the customers and always making sure their dining experience was really good. They have a nice variety of tequila and draft beers to go along with your lunch or dinner. If you like Mexico food with a little heat you'll love La Restia.
