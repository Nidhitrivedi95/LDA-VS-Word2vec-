wOk2b8zUHWylJOd6FtNsRw I am a glutton for punishment.  Had a very bad experience at Sylvias about 18 months ago.  Went back about 9 months ago and the service was so bad we didn't stay.  Went back yesterday because I was in the area and still think about all of the good meals I have eaten there over the last 30 years.  The food was OK (flour chips are really the driving force here) and service was good.  The problem was they have gotten greedy.  In general the fool is a less than average value but OK.  Unfortunately yesterday we ordered a couple of Micheladas with our breakfast.  If you don't know what that is, its basically a beer with hot sauce and a lime in it service in a salted rim glass.  They served it in a typical 16 oz glass and unlike most other places filled the glass with ice.  It was tasty but . . . they charged us $8 apiece for them.  Really?  Probably 6 ounces of beer, a couple of dashes of hot sauce, a lime and some salt.  I am not poor but come on.  Most restaurants do not show cocktail prices on their menu but you expect they are going to be reasonable.  This is ridiculous and the last straw for this place.  We will NEVER return.  We laughed that someone has opened a Mexican restaurant right across the street.  We will try that next time or make the trip to Aunt Chiladas at the point where they also have flour chips but don't try to rip their customers off.  Get a clue folks.  I have gone from being your best advertiser to telling people never to go there.
