I could not  decide what to order!  I pretty much wanted to sample the menu and everything I saw coming out of the kitchen.

So I settled in on the beach burger with roasted peppers, poblano I believe.  It looked normal enough but it was actually extraordinary .  I wasn't sure about the peppers but that flavor perfectly complemented the burger.  Fries were great.  I hope they are always that hot.  

Finally,  can't wait to get back to try some more of the offerings, probably whatever special they have.  As I understand it the special is not only a limited menu item but is also a pretty good value.  Last week special features double patty, sweet tots for $9.95.
