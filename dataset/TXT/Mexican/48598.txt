8B_ipmGG-zd8SUd7_0JqFQ Very bad burrito place!! I cant belive it how cheap they are on serving toppings, I almost had to fight for a few extra pieces of green onion! Extremely rude staff including some kid that is working with cash and he is serving food without washing his hands..never again!! There is so many options in the area and this place for me doesn't exist!
