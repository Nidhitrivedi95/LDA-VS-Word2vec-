The Platter for 2 combo is a great deal with a lot of food... love the soft tacos with the spicy fillings, and the hard tacos with the cool crisp salad veggies is a great way to cool the palate.  Oh!  The rice and beans are really good!  I could make a meal out of them alone.

The salsa is heavy on the cilantro, so if you are like me, and not a fan of cilantro, skip the salsa and get the yummy guacamole for the fresh house made tortilla chips.

The art on the walls is a nice touch, and available for purchase.
