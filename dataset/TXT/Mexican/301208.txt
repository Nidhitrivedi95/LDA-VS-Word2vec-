zS3-CKZVVvUYvasJnAg-aA Coming from Tucson, I looked for a Mexican place that would equal Nico's taco shop. I love being able to grab a burrito and go about my life. I have tried their California burrito and a carne asada burrito and they were both good. The food is fresh but it does take time to get. I don't mind waiting though. I really like their salsas and appreciate the free chips. This has become my go to for a burrito on a day where I just don't care to cook.
