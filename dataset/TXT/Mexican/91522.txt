DyOzNIeXUksPNLXYHnB-oQ We LOVE Sabor! The food is truly authentic and has my Salvadorian mother-in-law hooked. Some of the prices seem a little high but the portion size makes up for this for sure! The elote is great, takes me back to living in Dallas, TX with the food carts outside the grocery stores. 

The NODA location doesn't compare, stick with the Hawthorne location!
