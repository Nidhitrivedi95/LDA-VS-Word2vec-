WOz66UuVsfc2K9GxzfDnGg Four words: Bean and cheese burritos. [Some more words:] They are truly the best I've ever had, and that's saying something, because b&c burritos are one of my favorite comfort foods. The beans here are so creamy, and the tortilla is perfect.  Seriously, I crave this burrito all the time. 

I also love their cochata (iced coffee + horchata!) and chips and salsa. Call me basic -- I don't care.

Their tacos are great but tiny. Their pastor meat is carved right off of one of those huge rotisserie things like you'd see at the taco stands in Mexico. LEGIT.

This is the original location in a historical little bungalow, and still has the soul and character that are lacking at the franchises. The staff here is friendly and cool, and it's just all around an awesome place.
