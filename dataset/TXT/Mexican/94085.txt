e4NQLZynhSmvwl38hC4m-A This a hidden gem!!! I am so happy to have found this place for everything in the menu are amazing and very affordable!! You can tell that the ingredients are fresh and everything taste homemade. The customer service is good too, food comes out in a timely, efficient manner. I guess the only downside to this place is the lack of parking space. However, my friends and I can definitely overlook that for the AMAZING food!
