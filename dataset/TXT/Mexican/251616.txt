After that... BLAND. 
Nothing extraordinary. 
Bland is the best word that I can think of to describe this place. 
Not to mention, the chips are cold. 
My plate actually looked like something from a box of Marie Calendars. 
The service was just so-so. There were only 4 tables of guests.... Our tea glasses were rarely filled. 
Be weary of eating here... There's a Taco Bell just down the road... Probably better value.
