yGg7O0ATbMzoxrLvByzp2g Think of Restaurant Elixor as Cheesecake Factory-Canada. Similar decor and menu, though not as large a variety of cheesecake. Had the "Palais the Poulet Croustillant" (Crispy Chicken Pallazo) which is served on basil pasta with prosciutto, arugula, shaved parmesan and toasted pine nuts. Very good and somewhere I'd return to.
