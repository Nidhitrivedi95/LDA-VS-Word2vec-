Brand new, so this is BUSY! Hungry crowd  starts  about 11:20-11:30 a.m. By noon, the line's out the door. It's  a small, cozy-bright spot, with high-energy , friendly  people.

I love quesadillas and also chicken, so the chicken club quesadilla was a no brainer. It's  chicken, bacon, lettuce,  and tomatoes, with a zippy chipotle ranch dressing.  Fresh, delicious, and filling. The brownie looked tempting, but I'm a small eater and I don't usually order dessert when I'm out,  so I passed. This time. They also have cookies, ice tea, and Coke drinks.

I  wish they had outdoor seating, and this were a bigger space, but this is just a great place to eat!
