Small burrito joint, tight for space but provides an A++ product. I've tried almost all their burritos choices  and they all taste amazing and priced very well. They put the perfect amount of ingredients for it not to be messy.

Putting aside the food, it seems like they have many regulars and maintain a close relationship with the public. They were greeted nicely and even knowing their names, it was nice to see. I've also noticed a few people bringing friends who has not tried the food and has high regards for this restaurant.

Speaking of high regards, I will definitely bring myself back to this gem. And to add on, spread the name Burrito Boyz in port credit to all who don't know.

Keep up the great job!
