OlA7h9oOttqTALudvEUzTg A friend of mine recommended Gloria's! And I'm so glad she did. Even though it's brand new (opened just a few days ago), the experience was wonderful. The food was authentic, flavorful and just so.stinkin.delicious! The restaurant is small, but the decor is colorful and very welcoming. Nice drink selection (I recommend the Tequila Sunrise and Mojito!) I had the chicken quesadilla and my boyfriend had the chicken chimichanga. We both loved our meals and will definitely return. The staff was incredibly friendly and made the experience that much better. Kid-friendly. Very reasonably priced. Good portion sizes. Two tv's. Mexican music playing. A liiiiittle disorganized, but that will happen with any new establishment. Definitely worth checking out.
