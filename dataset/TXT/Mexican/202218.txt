PndkxtLCDv69LBE5Ay8Mwg Boyfriend and I both love the cucumber-pineapple drink and chip and salsa!! We have been here two time and on both occasions The chip and salsa appetizer were really really good! we always end up "cleaning" our salsa bowl both time. On the other hand, everything else was just okay. The tacos were meh, both carne Asada, pulled beef and pastor were dried and overpriced. The nacho we got the second time was pretty filling, good, but pretty heavy. We kind of wish they would give a bit more salsa or diced tomato to even out the heaviness. Anyway, i gave three stars for the salsa and cucumber drink. I would come back to just order a to go cucumber pineapple drink and try the mango but will probably skip the food
