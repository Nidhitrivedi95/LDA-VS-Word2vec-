T2tEMLpTeSMxLKpxwFdS3g So I have been here before and I do like this place but the wait is so long. It isn't there fault as this is one of the best restaurants in NODA. What is cool is that it is in the heart of NODA so you can grab a drink some where else while waiting or walk around and get a look of the colorful artwork. 

I am trying out vegan now so I was shocked at the options I did have for that lifestyle . . People who love guacamole! You found your new place to love guacamole!!  Now for non vegan people you need to try the fish tacos! Delicious! 

The atmosphere is cool but a little small on the inside as this adds to the wait . It has a good word of mouth and some people go insane over this place and I understand why too. I have eaten at a lot places and I still recommend here all the time. Just be prepared to wait.
