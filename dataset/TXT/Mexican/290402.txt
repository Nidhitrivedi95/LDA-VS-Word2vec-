Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ My family and I came in here for breakfast because it was included with the room when you stay in the Tower Suites. I wasn't expecting it to be as nice as it was. We had a view that was overlooking the patio and the swimming pool. You have quite a few choices to choose from that is included with the room. 

I went with the eggs benedict and others chose the french toast, the fruit and pastry platter, eggs and ham and waffles. Everyone loved their selection and left very full and happy. The service was top notch. This is quite a nice perk for staying in the Tower Suites. Definitely added to a great experience.
