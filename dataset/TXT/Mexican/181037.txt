nc7YTLSXEWPG4Q0WlI5iPQ We have eaten here many times for the past 7 years, but hadn't been there in about 3 or 4 months.  Seated right away, and server was prompt.  Chips were cold and one sauce served now in a little plastic cup.  Margaritas were better than ever before, so that was a plus. Cheese crisp came out swimming in oil.  We didn't realize until we had pulled some pieces out.  We took a few bites and sent it back to be cooked.  They returned the same one, that had been cooked a little while longer but was still soaked in grease. Lunch came pretty quickly.  Two of us had tacos that were so salty we thought the salt shaker had been spilled into them. Two of us ordered red chili burros that weren't served hot, and were bland. I don't know what happened here, but we were really disappointed and don't plan on returning any time soon. Too bad because it is so close and in my neighborhood.
