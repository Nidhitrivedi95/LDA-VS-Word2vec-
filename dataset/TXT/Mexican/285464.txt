y3RlbCN0UrDdLnjSF9NkXA First time going and will not go back. I was curious to try as it is by my house and always packed. As soon as I walked in I knew it was not authentic Mexican food, the decor is a mix of Mexican, Spanish and Argentina culture the people eating here are all Caucasian, nothing wrong but food is too Americanized and does not have heat. Albóndiga soup has too much cumin and not good beef broth flavor. I am giving it a one star because the combo plate I had was a chile verde enchilada and a chile relleno which both were very good did not eat the rice or beans again not real Mexican. The salad was full of water therefore the dressing list the creaminess and flavor.
