-qb_3LLSnBcHA6zc8NRSxQ Went there today for lunch, we have been many times in the past, it seems the menu has changed again with higher prices! I ordered the Carna Asada and it was so unbelievably tough with huge vein inside! The flavor was very good but had a hard time chewing it! I don't think we will be going back any time soon or at all!
