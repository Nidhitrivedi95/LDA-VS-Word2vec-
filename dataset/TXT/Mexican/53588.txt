9pWzjhdrPgsZEmF7-QOaIQ I'm not a local... I'm from Detroit. My wife and I had these during our stay in Toronto. The price is very affordable, we ordered three different tacos to try with a side of beans and chips. The tacos were full and full of flavor! If you're in the downtown Toronto area and craving authentic (enough) tacos, this is the place to try!
