XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill is a go-to when in Vegas. I've dined here a few times as well as when there was a Mesa Grill in the Bahamas and I've loved it every time. What's to love? The flavour. I've never had a dull plate. The pork tenderloin, the rabbit, the salmon and the coffee-rubbed steak - all amazing. Service is good, not great but I can honestly say it doesn't diminish the overall experience of dining here.
