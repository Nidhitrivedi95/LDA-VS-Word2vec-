ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA Ocotillo is unique on the inside and outside. It looks like a renovated storage unit and it offers a variety of seating arrangements- tables and couches outside, long high tables inside as well as booths on one end and white tablecloth seating on the opposite end. The vibe of Ocotillo seems hip casual but also somewhat upscale.
I ate here for dinner one night and my food was very tasty. We ordered a cauliflower for the table that was cooked perfectly and has a delicious mint and peanut flavor. The meat eaters at the table were pretty impressed and wouldn't stop raving about it. After placing my entree order for a falafel burger I immediately felt like I made a mistake and should have ordered something more interesting because there menu has delicious sounding small plates, pasta and salads to choose from but WOW. For not being a Mediterranean restaurant, they do falafel RIGHT. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and not dry. The beets that accompanied it made it outstanding. Everyone else at my table was pleased with their food- pastas and ribs. 
My only complaint is that you don't have the option to order a lighter side with a sandwich or burger- it just comes with fries. 
The service was okay, not fantastic but they were relatively new at the time so I'm sure it's improved. I had a fun experience so I'm definitely going back!
