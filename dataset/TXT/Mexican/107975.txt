frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A The food was excellent but the service needs a lot of work.

The girl working up front does not know what she is doing. It was hard to watch her struggle as the two groups in front of us left after waiting for 20 minutes. The kicker is that it was not even packed. There was about 10 tables open and she made four groups wait for over 20+ minutes. She needs to be trained or let go.

The waiter was stressed out and could not remember something you said to here a few seconds ago. I ordered a Coke and horchata a total of three times. We only got the horchata as we were leaving...... The horchata was delicious though....

We ordered around 8 street tacos of different varieties and they were all A+. The selection of salsa was also very good. You can tell that they are understaffed and struggle with giving good service.

We thought we would try some tequila and the waiter brought us house tequila which tasted like cleaning materials. We then ordered the $15 Don Julio tequila and she brought back out the same house tequila..

Even though the service was terrible I would come back for the food.
