3te8dGIvzz5V5_kMIr6-Dg I'm not vegan, but as a vegetarian I have a real appreciation for food done well, sans meat. There are a bunch of 'mexican' joints in the market, but I don't mind walking a little further to go to Hot Beans. It's sort of my weekly treat.

The place is a little hard to find at the boring end of Baldwin, and you don't quite know what door to pick on the first go. Are they open? Yes they are! Go in, now!

The food is so damn good, and all the meat textures are excellent, even if you are not trying to pretend it actually is meat. It's just good. Donuts are also just as good as any donut I've had before. It's not cheap, but when the food is this good, and this specialized it's worth it. Also, the forks and packaging are biodegradable, and that is worth paying a bit more for.
