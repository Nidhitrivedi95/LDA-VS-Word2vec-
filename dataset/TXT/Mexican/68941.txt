BoTb3FqOsJaFe_koVfyGbw I decided to give this a second try, my kid wanted to go to Moe's. Well, I wish would have went to Moe's. I had a steak burrito bowl, wife had a steak salad. Steak was tough and very bland. We feel all of the food was flavorless. One daughter had tacos and said it was ok, and the other had them make a "taco bowl" with tofu.

Service ws very friendly, but food was just not there. Next time will go back to Moe's.
