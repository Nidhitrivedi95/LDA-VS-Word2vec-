Ryqmm5vXHmSscZjzQQkyxQ I've been going to their Yonge and Bloor location since they opened and it's one of my favourite places to go. Every time I'm there, it's packed - and I don't even go there on the weekends!  So it's disappointing to see so many negative reviews about my go-to spot. 

I've tried pretty much everything on the menu, and while I have my favourites, I always leave there satisfied with their service and a full belly. 

I love their back patio!  It's enclosed and away from the Yonge street chaos, which means I can be outside and enjoy my meal without eating exhaust fumes too.
