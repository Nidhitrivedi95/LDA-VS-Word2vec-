AhPmh0NaRDbEYyhd9egzLA Had the most amazing time at joyride! I loved my braised beef taco the most! Also Clint was amazing, he was so friendly and amazing. The smallest mistake happened with our margarita order it literally wasn't a big deal at all! They comped our margaritas because of it which was so nice but also unnecessary! Just shows how important it is to them that you have an amazing experience there! I encourage everyone to try it! Love you Clint!
