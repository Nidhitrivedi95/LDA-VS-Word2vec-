_XN-GwzZwAyIqLKJsl2htg I'm going to start by saying our waitress was a little too excited for my friends and I and the food we ordered. A little annoying. Also, the chicken taco has a perfumey taste. 

With that being said, this place is amazing! The sushi is fresh, the gauc is to kill for, and the beef and pork tacos were well with the trip for. My friends had a couple of drinks that were craftly made that lead to seconds. This is must try!
