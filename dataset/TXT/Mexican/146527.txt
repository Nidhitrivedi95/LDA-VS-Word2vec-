JkzqS4JDOpoHrj534rzvAA My husband and I were in Phoenix for the weekend and wanted home made food, not franchised food. The meat lovers breakfast was delicious and plentiful, according to my husband. I had the huaraches, which is basically a flat, fried gordita covered in beans, asada, onions and cilantro--it was awesome! The pineapple water was fresh and scrumptious. The staff Juan and Sarah were so friendly and they definitely take pride in this place. Try it and be pleased.
