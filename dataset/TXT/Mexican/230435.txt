sH3UsolKjik01u0HlQ9_0Q Is there better Mexican food in Charlotte??? I think not!! I live for the enchiladas poblanas and rarely order anything else. Their mole sauce is the best on the planet. 

Friends and family have had (and I've sampled) the tacos, empanadas, burritos and fajitas. All delish! To make things even better, Three Amigos also runs amazing specials and has a wonderful craft beer selection.
