The Watermelon Agua Fresca is delightfully refreshing and if it was not for the disrespectful hostess with the surly attitude and fake red hair who kept me waiting for a table for 15 minutes even though there were at least 4 Four Tops open, I might be inclined to give this restaurant a more favorable review.
