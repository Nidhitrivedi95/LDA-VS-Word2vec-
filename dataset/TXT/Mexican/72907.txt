Cd3InBI7yCeXjf6xKv4jbA This place was really delicious! We got two cheese and beef cheese crisps for our two kids. One could have easily been shared between them though. They were pretty big. My husband got the beef, cheese and bean burrito and he really liked it. He said that the beans were really flavorful! I got the chicken, potato and cheese burrito which was awesome! But when they say that their chicken is spicy, believe it! It was pretty spicy and I can usually handle spicy stuff. It was delicious though. And whatever brand of tortillas they use are so good! I must say, we also really enjoyed hearing how much fun the guys that work here were having together. They were singing along to their music and just seemed really happy to be there doing what they do. It puts out a really nice vibe. You don't see that at too many places these days. Great place, definitely recommend!
