GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog The two stars are for the decor only.  To begin with, the chinese food was awful.  We ordered the hot and sour soup (Don't Be Jealous) and the Dan Dan Mian.  The soup was horrible! The soup tasted metallic and was literally 2 drops in a bucket! Not worth the price! The Dan Dan Mian was oily and bland! I've had better for half the price! We also ordered two soft tacos.  The tacos were extra wet and fell apart too easily.  Plus, they were really small. We could have gotten better tacos from a taco truck!

In the end, china poblano's version of "authentic" chinese food + "authentic" mexican food = disastrous mess.  Never going back!
