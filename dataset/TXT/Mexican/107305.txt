fqMAnoS2sTokz6lqBSmoCw I'm not sure what concept the owner is trying to play here but it's not working. The first thing I noticed when coming in on Sunday afternoon is that there's almost no one there. Why? According to the bartender its because there are no Tv's and the Panthers were playing. He mentioned there are few people in on Saturday afternoons either because of college football and no TVs. Conversely, Mac's next door, with lots of Tv's, was packed. Im not saying they should have loads of tvs because its not a sports bar. But a 60 inch in each corner with the sound turned down would keep the sports fans from walking away. I would also note that this place has no draft beer, no local brews at all. Finally, its really bright. Too bright. Theres very little ambiance here. Its just straight up boring. To the owner id say this: this is the South End of Charlotte. Its not Uptown. Sports and beer is what goes on here. Maybe add a live band a few nights a week? Make it more fun and lively. If you dont do something soon you should plan on a bankruptcy filing.
