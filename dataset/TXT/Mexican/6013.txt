I always come for the produce but enjoy browsing the store in entirety and grabbing whatever I need.  

This location is a bit smaller than the other location on Meadows lane but still has all the amenities of the bigger sister or brother. 

What's different about Cardenas from other markets : 

Smoothie making station - you can order a smoothie with fresh fruit. 

Tortillas - they make them fresh here. They have hugged machines in the back where the make fresh tortillas, huaraches, chips, masa etc. 

Meats - order by the pound. A lot of marinated meats ready to grill. 

Produce - very inexpensive produce section. 

Kitchen - after you've worked up an appetite from shopping you can go order tacos, burritos, etc. They sell fresh agua Frescas to wash everything down. They actually out whatever fresh fruit of whatever flavor it is. 

This place is perfect for grabbing all your Mexican essentials. They have plenty of prepared salsas ready so if you're having a party or bbq it's the perfect place to come.
