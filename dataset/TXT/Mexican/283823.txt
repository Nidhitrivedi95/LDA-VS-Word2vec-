xZhNZb01n9b4e2X7bZdoVQ I got a big laugh out of visiting this place after reading the yelp reviews. I was totally expecting a place with mediocre food but people that were buzzed enough to think it was "legendary". Let me tell you what, there was definitely some serious drinking going on ... both in the seating area and I suspect behind the bar and/or in the kitchen as well. My waiter looked like the staff might also be hot boxing in a back room somewhere. So as not to feel left out, I ordered myself I margarita on the rocks. Not surprisingly, it was very strong. For dinner I got a combination plate of some kind. It was indeed mediocre. Not bad, not great. The prices were also cheap which was a plus.
