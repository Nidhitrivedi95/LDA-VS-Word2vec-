K-uQkfSUTwu5LIwPB4b_vg The Mission has great tacos and margaritas. I don't recommend getting the seafood (scallops) though. We smelled them as they were bringing them to our table. I can't believe we were still served them because of the scent alone. Nonetheless, my husband who doesn't want to send anything back ate them. They were raw on the inside which made them chewy. I don't know about you but I'm not exactly into chewy and smelly food.

Other than that, the service is pretty good and the food is decent.
