xQkYCap-n_ZB5c-1BvUnuw Marleth forgot to enter our 3 chicken sandwiches in the the drive thru line. When we arrived at the window she read back an order that was not ours. She realized she forgot to enter what we ordered, looked at us and said loud and clear "FUCK!" She look over to one of her co-workers and said "Shit, see why I need to go home early?" She also showed her frustration with the customer ordering thru the headset as she failed to multitask and rolled her eyes as we waited. Get rid of this girl is is truly bad for business.
