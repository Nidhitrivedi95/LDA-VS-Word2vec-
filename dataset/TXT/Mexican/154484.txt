K-uQkfSUTwu5LIwPB4b_vg A last minute anniversary dinner on a Friday night found us packed in with people staying after work and other with early dinner plans.

Guacamole was...good.  I'll leave it at that.  The Crispy Cola Pork with lettuce wraps were unbelievably good.  Messy, but good.

Wife had Mahi Mahi tacos and she loved them.  They were indeed flavourful with the escabeche.  My Malbec braised short-rib was exquisite.  The scalloped-like potatoes didn't make the dish too heavy and the meat needed no knife to cut through.

The best of the night was chocolate souffle-like dish with the ice cream.  Incredible flavours for such a simple dish. 

French-pressed coffee afterwards was just as good with a spicy blend.
