g384tK63QxXXm3UNhtGMuA The Green Butcher taco with beans..... not bad. I would have like more green chili flavor but it was tender so points for that and I did like the Green tortillas that was a nice touch visually. Flavor is almost there but good for a late nite snack especially after a baseball game
