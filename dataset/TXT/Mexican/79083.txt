CsS9WsonGYyE3vINi5bxSg Came here with a friend and it was good! 

Ordered the guacamole (which was fresh and came with an ample amount of chips...and was actually a decent portion of guac); the octopus tacos (these were good, octopus was well seasoned and cooked and had guac and other veggies on it, and the baja fish taco (this was delicious grilled fish, perfectly cooked with a delicious kimchi slaw. We came on a wednesday and easily got a table, this place is weirdly lit, and has a nice ambiance. 

Seems like a very hipster place to come. PRO TIP: you can get you tacos with a lettuce shell instead of a tortilla shell.
