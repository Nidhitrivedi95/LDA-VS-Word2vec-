HhopVWTjghrRU2sWGBv-Rg It was definitely an odd Sunday. We wanted tacos and ended up going to 2 other places that were closed. So, we found ourselves going through what we thought was a drive through, only it was actually for preordered pick ups. 

The lady in the window was very kind. She explained it was pickups and offered a few menus so we could decide on what we wanted. Once she took our order, she asked that we loop around so that other customers could pick up their food while ours were being made. 

We did just that and took our meals home to eat. We live about 6 minutes away from this location and I began eating immediately. I ordered the carne asada burrito enchilada style and my guy ordered a burrito that came enchilada style with green sauce.

Upon first opening my plate, first taste, I was no sure how I felt. The sauce tasted a bit molé and was lacking in flavor and flare. It was mediocre. I bite into the burrito which has tons of tortilla folded up. It was like a soggy bready tortilla, that's the only way I can explain it. I couldn't decide if it had been fried or not but it just wasn't all that. The carne inside was cubed and bleck. Dry, old, over cooked? I'm not sure. Not to mention it was cold. Like colder than a 6 minute drive should allow. I knew they couldn't have just handed me whatever since we ordered it on the spot. 

I didn't try the other burrito but my Love tasted mine and indicated that his was virtually the same but with Greek sauce. His also had avocado and sour cream but somehow, they still tasted the same. I wish I had seen the option for rice and beans because I ended up not eating my burrito because of how disappointed I was. 

It was bland and just whatever. The man mentioned as he ate it he remembered their food always tasting as though it was lacking something, everything.... I am glad I tried it now but based on this go round, I am likely to not want to try it again.
