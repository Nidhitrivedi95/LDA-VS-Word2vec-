n_4PTgvjsKc74u8AwXOfAQ Can you really complain when you can get a menu item for $1.25?  This cafeteria style Mexican joint is dirty, quick, and cheap.  It's everything that one would expect in Kensington Market, and it's everything a cheap Chinaman could ever want.

I don't know what any of the taco/taquito fillings are called, most of them I can't even identify the source of the meat.  Love it.  I just look and point.  Nothing I've ever pointed at has disappointed.  You definitely want hot sauce on whatever you point at.

Three taquitos for $3.75 will do you pretty good, I reckon.  A 3.5 star rating for me.  Potential for 4 stars.

TOONIE & A LOONIE RECOMMENDATION: a tasty taquito for $1.25..or two for $2.50 with $0.50 to spare!
