HTlsBAd9j1wlWDHxnYczBw I went here last night with 2 girlfriends for a celebratory occasion. We were seated in a booth and promptly served warm tortilla chips (homemade) with 2 little carafes of salsa (one was pico de gallo and the other was a spicier).

I ordered the 2 Tamale dinner and was a tad disappointed as there was so much melted cheese and grease, I couldn't even "find" the 2 alleged tamales?! I did sample my friend's dinner (2 beef tacos) and the beef was perfectly seasoned and not too dry - great job!! 

The service was friendly and attentive - I may go back here but definitely would order something else. I came home smelling of Mexican restaurant, and the smell was still lingering in my car the following morning driving to work?
