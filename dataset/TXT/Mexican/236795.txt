sW3oXGgDbbOC3YkiFKZNMQ Love Chipotle but our last two experiences at this location have been poor. First time we waited in line quite a while while they filled an online order. To me this should be done be a separate person and should not be holding up a line with several people in it.  Last night we went and waited in a line only to find out that they had no brown rice and wouldn't have any for 15-20 min! Seriously? This should NEVER happen! Be prepared! We left!
