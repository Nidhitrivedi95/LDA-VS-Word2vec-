Oto60yDwk1z72WmfWEYrjg Food was decent, not terrible but nothing to rave about. The frozen margaritas were less than thrilling... way too much salt and definitely not enough alcohol. The service was awful. Incredibly slow waitstaff, I actually received my margarita after I received my entree..... The best part is the chips that are served with salsa, guacamole, and a bean dip.
