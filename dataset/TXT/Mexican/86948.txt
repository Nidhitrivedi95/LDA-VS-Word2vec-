diwRPVKeYiUJ9tqlr1orAg I'm so disappointed in this location . Came here after a long day wanting some food. Taco Bell is surprisingly known for their great vegan options so I come here anytime I'm in a rush or I'm lazy . I will start off by saying my cashier Balice was amazing , and is to good for this place . Any how I ordered all of my food for my boyfriend and I without cheese or meat , add potatoes and guacamole . It is correct on my receipt (thank you Balice) but when I got home and took a bite of my food I got a big ass glob of cheese. I checked all of my food and it all had cheese . Yay. It also did not have potatoes . I called the manager and explained to her what happened . She said there was miscommunication in the kitchen and they thought it meant no cheddar cheese , just nacho cheese . Well first of all no cheese means no cheese and they gave me cheddar cheese lol?! Wtf . She said I could give her my name for store credit and come in later . No I'm not driving all the way back there . I asked to please give my money back as I am vegan and allergic to dairy so I can't eat the food . She said : I was hoping to help you but I guess not . Sad excuse for customer service . I'm not surprised as I had to call 5 times and get hung up on before anyone answer . Beware and check your food before driving off like I did . I will attach pictures as the manager wasn't interested in them :)
