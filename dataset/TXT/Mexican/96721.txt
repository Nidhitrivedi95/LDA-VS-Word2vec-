eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw BEST NACHOS I'VE EVER HAD.
If you love seafood, let me recommend the Crab and Lobster (seafood) nachos! They were sooooo delicious and came on a cookie sheet sized tray. It was definitely enough for both of us to share. Also, the chips and salsa as an appetizer was perfect!! They bring out 3 delicious salsa flavors (mild, medium and hot). We can NEVER come back to Las Vegas and NOT eat here. Easily my favorite restaurant here. Also, Aerrick was the most energetic server working last night. His service was soooooo amazing!!! You're lucky if you get him as a server. I would've tipped him $1,000 if I could've. Thank you for the amazing service Aerrick. I'm sure you get complimented on your service quite often.
