J7B-hSSYDYSIQx5xiqOJTw greeted nicely at the door by a younger gal that was SUPER nice and sweet.
Got seated rather quickly, ordered beverages right away. 
Sever (Vanessa), she needs to have training 101 all over again. I understand in a busy place on a Saturday things can get overwhelming, but in a customer service industry, don't show that to people. She was just not working with even a half a deck. Lights out!  There were a few bills at the table as we had a party of 6, all 3 needed to be fixed. 
I will personally come back here not only because how nicely we were greeted upon coming in (for the first time), but the food was good. Just wish there was more of it. I recommend to anyone to try the sandwiches, great! The salsa chips are better than Chipotle even (I felt they were the best before I came here). Would have been a 5 star but the server dropped it down to a lower 4.
