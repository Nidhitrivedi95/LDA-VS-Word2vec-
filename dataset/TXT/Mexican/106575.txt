fL2vdjn-ApNcsVntxtg4Dg We got an awesome deal through Hotels.com for a room . The staff is courteous and friendly at every bar, the buffet and the hotel registration desk. The room was clean and stayed comfortable throughout the night! The A/C was not noisy it did have an interesting fan noise every so often but it was not loud. The buffet has many choices and for 9 bucks you cannot get good mongolian grill anywhere else! The 99 cent margaritas were a good after-spicy-dinner drink! Everyone should try this place!! The only bad thing is the smoke however its not as thick as some of the other casinos!
