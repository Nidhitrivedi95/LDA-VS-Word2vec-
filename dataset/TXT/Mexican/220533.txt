Rj-7ymdw8aNZBRqGRAjR3Q Met with friends for dinner here on 11/27 (ultimately a party of 9) and we had a fantastic meal here. They were very accommodating when our party size fluctuated and with those with dietary requests (gluten-free for celiac and low carb). Definitely order the chips and salsa which is bottomless and comes with 3 different salsas and the el sol margaritas. I wasn't feeling terribly hungry, but ordered the elote and the chicken taquitos anyway. The elote was delish - just a tad burnt and smokey - used tortilla chips to scoop up the little nuggets of gold and cotija cheese. The taquitos were awesome - I'm still thinking about the orange salsa/sauce the dish came with. It was sweet and acidic - I even told the manager how good it was that I debated knocking back the shot before we left for the night. I would love it if I could get that recipe!!
