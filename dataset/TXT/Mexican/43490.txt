7GGJlp1aWfcXGQz6q7SkXQ After Yelping for an upcoming Vegas trip I came across this bar and it seemed like everything I am about and everything I love back home. I was right. This place did not let me down.. it did take some finding as it is inside the Venetian Hotel. This place is divey but not intimidating. The bartenders were all awesome and there was a nice mixed crowd both times I came. Drinks  and shots are a bit pricey but it's Vegas after all and the atmosphere made the price worth it. The food seemed like standard bar food but that can be just what you need after a few drinks. The drinks were delicious and strong what more could you ask for? Best of all? A $50 option to drink all day, come and go as you please!
