OD09pm-MzynigAvD5KoGPA Pretty good food. It wasn't life changing and it wasn't insane but it's definitely a place to come back to. I ordered a wet green chile beef burrito while my boyfriends ordered the street tacos with carne asada, chipotle chicken, tinga chicken. The carne asada and chipotle chicken was alright but the tinga was kinda plain and not that great. But the green chile was absolutely delicious. I would recommend that everyone gets this one because you won't be disappointed.
