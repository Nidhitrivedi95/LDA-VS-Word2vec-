oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ So disappointing! We had been wanting to try this place for a while, we always pass it on the Linq promenade and I love Mexican food. It gets two stars just because of the great view from the patio. Other than that, the menu on the website is different, and looked better there too - I wanted to try the butternut squash burrito but it wasn't available. My salmon was served undercooked, nothing special about the rest of the food, and who doesn't put wine in their sangria? That was juice, Sprite, and a splash of triple sec, not a sangria. And to top it off, I tried to buy a Groupon a few hours before the meal that got stuck as pending so I couldn't use it. At least I got a refund there, because we won't be coming back to this place.
