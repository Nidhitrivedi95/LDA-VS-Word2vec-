First of all, you have to get past all the cardboard cutouts of Mary Sue Milliken about how wonderful the restaurant is because she was on Top Chef.  Frankly, the place is overrated for the food quality at their prices.

Beware of any house specialty drinks, because they gouge you for higher prices in smaller glasses and frankly one gets bored with how many ways to drink a margarita.

I had their specialty Yucatan Pork, which I sent back because it was too dry to eat, and it took a LOT of negotiations with the server to remove it from the bill, although they did later.  They came back and told me the Kitchen said it was perfect - - - every time I watch Top Chef and if the customer isn't happy, then why in the hell argue with me?

We sat on the enclosed balcony which was a little cold, although they had heaters.  However all the servers used the doors closest to the table which were seated and each time they entered and exited, cold wind blew in.  I asked the Servers if they could use the doors on the other side of the wall where no one was seated so that the cold air would not blow on us, but they would not.

The Server did her best to comfort us, and it took THREE attempts to get a hot cup of decaf coffee and all I heard about was excuses.  When I did get a hot cup of coffee the cream was spoiled and curdled in the coffee.

So would I return?  No.  Top Chef?  Yeah right.  The restaurant doesn't practice what it preaches.  With the quality of restaurants in Vegas, and those I haven't had the opportunity to eat at, I would rather try something new then come back again.  I find it extremely arrogant to make a play off Top Chef when it doesn't live up to its name.
