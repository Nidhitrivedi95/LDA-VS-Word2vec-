FGaaHr_krwaPGlD0mHPe4Q Went here with a group of 20. We had gotten there early and still it took 30 min to get seated. Dinner was fine except we had one server and he was overwhelmed. When we were done the server brought out everything on one bill. We asked to have it split as we were all separate couples. The server said he could separate them but encouraged us to just note what was ours on the bill. So we each listed what needed to be on each card and turned it over. After 10 min. The server came out and said he could not split it this way. This is after some in our party hearing him tell another employee that "this is stupid, it makes no sense." While he looked at our bill. We were then asked to split it even by 12 cards. We agreed, but he then came back and said the register would only let him split it 6 ways. In the end, we put it on one card and will not be returning.
