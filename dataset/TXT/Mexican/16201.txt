We all loved the warm chips and salsa that were promptly delivered to our table, with refills offered when the chips got low. Everyone's meal was delicious. The chicken fajitas were probably the best I've had - veggies cooked just right, lots of chicken, and soft, warm tortillas. Service was friendly efficient. Noise level was comfortable for a family friendly place. We will definitely be back!!
