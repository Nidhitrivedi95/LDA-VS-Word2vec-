BWmex2gxmeWWFwb6hjKm5Q Qdoba is one step up from a drive-through, but it's definitely worth the couple extra dollars. Not too spendy, good food that doesn't make you sick, unique flavor. What more can you ask for in a "make your own" burrito bar. Plus, the drink machine they have is pretty awesome! So many different soda flavors, I'd go back just to get an unique soda. 

Obviously, not the greatest food in the world. But good enough to curve a good burrito craving.
