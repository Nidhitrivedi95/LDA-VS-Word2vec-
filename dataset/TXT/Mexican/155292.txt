I order the cheese dip that, although runny was decent tasting and the Margarita was honestly great. I ordered a vegetarian dish which apparently means I only eat cheese wrapped up in dough and smothered in bland, most likely canned sauce. My friend got the chicken Taco salad and couldn't finish more than a few bites of her boiled chicken over lettuce, although the tortilla bowl it was in was nicely crisp. When the check came  we noticed inconsistencies and we're told with no apologies that our appetizer wasn't among the nachos, not appetizers,  that were half off. On top of that we had a coupon that was from a 2014 coupon book but it expired a year before in 2013. THEY PRINTED THE COUPON ALMOST A YEAR EXPIREDD, so it could never be used. Oh may I add that the ceiling in the booth behind us started raining water from the ceiling. I saw waiters walk by repeatedly before I said something. No puddle was mopped,  they just put buckets around. We decided to ask for a manager when they again over charged us at payment. The check was $32 and when me and my friends got our card statement to sign it came back $20 each.... Do the math. It took 35 min for a manager who refused to comp us anything reasonable. We eventually walked out without signing anything and refusing to pay. The restaurant then charged our cards the initial $20, which was more than we even ordered. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. I still tipped the waiter for taking his time and table.
