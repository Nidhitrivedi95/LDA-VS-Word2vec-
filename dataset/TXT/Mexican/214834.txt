QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA Service was good. Didn't have to wait long for server after we sat down and she was very nice and helpful. 

Drinks were pretty good. We got the Daddy's Margarita which was a good size and not completely filled with ice like most places. You could actually taste the alcohol and it was only $12. 

Food was absolutely delicious.  Chips and salsa were good, but salsa was a little too runny. Fiesta nachos were SO GOOD.  I also got pork street tacos (mini appetizer size) and there was so much meat packed in I had to take some out just to fold the taco and I could only eat 2 out of the 3. 

If there are 2 of you, chips and salsa and an order of fiesta nachos would have been plenty to share. 

On my way out I saw a terrarium and thought, oh interesting, but saw a bunch of crickets (eww) in there and wondered what was up with that. Later I read about the scorpion drinks and I'm glad I didn't know about it while I was eating in the restaurant. I don't need a tub full of insects lurking around in the restaurant that I'm eating at thank you very much!
