du9EiKx28BVs-2hUAQ3UVg Dirty, disorganized, and undercooked food. Wow was this a horrible experience.

While it's entirely possible that there were  staffing issues, the seating and bussing of tables was by  waitress rotation so people just stood at the door for ten minutes in confusion as tables were being attended too.  Most annoying was the manager who was expediting but wasn't busy. Instead of helping her staff, she just watched and bs'd with employees. 

Had the manager helped bus tables and clean in between settings, it might have worked. Instead, the waiters and waitresses openly argued in front of customers about unclean sections.

Lastly we ordered two omelets that, while coming quickly, were under done and oozing with uncooked egg and unbalanced contents. Potatoes and bread were good but prefer not to have to step on them under the table from the previous occupants. 

Have had some good meals here in the past...clearly just a leadership issue
