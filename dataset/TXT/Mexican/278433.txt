XMrLwzmEAsfNpbKRC7vUzQ I live right next to this place and find it to be a convenient place to grab a drink and watch sports.  This place yoyos in my opinion though hence only 3 stars. Ive had great service and ive also had very poor and slow service.  They have a decent beer selection but the food department is lacking in my opinion. I ordered wings (twice) both times they were cold and overly dressed with sauce.  The queso con carne is about the best thing on the menu in my opinion.  But as usual ill be back.
