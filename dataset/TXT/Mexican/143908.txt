JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg Enjoyed the chips and salsa. Tried three tacos (al pastor, carnitas, asada) and enjoyed carnitas and the asada.  Didn't care as much for the chicken enchilada but my companion enjoyed it. 

Also ordered tableside guac - should have asked for more heat. They were happy to provide additional jalapenos upon request. 

Speaking of jalapeno, the jalapeno margarita was fantastic. Also enjoyed the organic beers (ipa, Amber, blonde), with preference for Amber. 

Next trip I'll likely order the carnitas plate.  Def planning to check out breakfast options!
