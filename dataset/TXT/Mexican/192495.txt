OlA7h9oOttqTALudvEUzTg Very good selection of homestyle Mexican. I had camarones a la diabla which were served with hot fresh tortillas. Prices are very reasonable for good sized portions. Chips on table could be a little fresher but aren't terrible. Definitely enough interesting things on menu to come back.
