gEv1Og5uGDLw9HkbKSGUZw El Caballito is confused. It doesn't know whether to be a dive bar or a high end Tequila bar. And because of this it misses the mark in both cases. Drinks were good, food was good, service was ok, cleanliness was poor. Would I go back? If a friend really wanted to go there sure. Other than that, I think I will spend my time elsewhere.
