iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg Tiny, tiny place with one take and stand-up dining, this pace offers great tacos. With options of fish & meat tacos. We had the Blackened grilled Mahi Mahi, fried fish tacos, Gobenator.

The deep fried fish taco was so delicious. I added a little bit of mild sauce on the taco and it was a jammed packed hearty and fresh taco. They don't go cheap on toppings here at all. In fact, they use two small soft shell tortillas to support them.

The Blackened Mahi Mahi is delicious with raw onions, guacamole and tomatoes. The fish is fresh and juicy and my second favorite.

The Gobenator filled with shrimp and tons of veggies as toppings. It's more savory and very filling. My third favorite, but still good.

The reason this gets a 3* and not 5* is because 1) they have no washroom, which is a shame, since you're eating with your hands. Also, by law, you're supposed to allow customers to use your bathroom. Saying you "don't have one" is a lie.

Our server also was in la-la-land and wasn't really paying attention when we were asking about the tacos l tacos favorite. We had to repeat ourselves 3 times as she stared out the window. Really weird.
