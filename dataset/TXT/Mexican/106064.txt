fK1oj0dk9Bc6KsBk5mMDxg When eating tacos, I like to have a good hot sauce on the side. Cantina definitely delivered in this respect. On the table, there are two hot sauces, the red one, chipotle based, and the green one, SPICY! 

We ordered the octopus taco, fish taco and the LA truck taco. The combination of flavors worked very well. Each was enjoyable but the octopus was particularly good. I'm not sure how they cook it, but it was soft and flavorful. We also have the ceveche and plated chorizo burrito. The ceveche was not what I expected; I could have used some more salt and lime. The burrito was quite good, and unique. It had a fried egg on top, along with many sauces. 

The reason for 3-star rating is mainly because of the price. With so many other fusion taco places around now, changing $5+ for a taco seems to be a bit steep.
