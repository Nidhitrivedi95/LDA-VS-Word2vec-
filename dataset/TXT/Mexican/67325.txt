We went there pretty late after a concert and were still made to feel welcome even though it was close to closing time.  The chips and salsa were brought to the table right away and were really good.  The waiter was patient with our questions and difficulty making a choice with so many great sounding options.  We both ended up getting the pulled pork sandwich that came with apple slaw on a bun, crispy onion rings, and french fries.  We were able to substitute the fries for vegetables and they were carrots and zucchini.  The meat was a little less warm than I'd like but the taste was quite good.  We were warned that it was spicy but that's what you would expect in a New Mexican restaurant.  The service was good and attentive.  We did not feel rushed and really enjoyed our meal.  Would definitely go back.  Also noted that they give a discount if you have tickets for a concert that night in Mesa.
