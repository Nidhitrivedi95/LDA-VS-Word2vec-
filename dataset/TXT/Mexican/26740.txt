3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ I live around the area and I have to say, one of my go to places. 
House margaritas are wonderful, almost too easy to drink.  I sat at the bar by myself and it wasn't a pick up place ( much to my liking!!).  
Garth, the Manager, is fun to chat with.  If you want to know about tequila, he's the one to talk to. 

Tacos are really good but I would avoid the rice.  Seems to be always under cooked and dry.  Quite a shame because a side would be nice.  Instead Order a salad.  

Beautiful and unique building.  They recently added music on Fri and Sat nights.  
( ok for kids but would suggest not) 
Local favorite hangout for me.
