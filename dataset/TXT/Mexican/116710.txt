Gl01qPpjC9DKN_Py3IEnpA I love chipotle chicken salads, hoooooowever, whenever I go in for lunch there is always a call in order and all other people being served have to wait 5-10 minutes while the call ahead is helped. Today againnnn, I had to sit and wait for the call in to cut in line and pay.  While I was waiting they managed to switch around my meal with someone else's. There is nothing more frustrating than getting home just to realize they gave you the wrong food.  Isn't this the very reason you have two people working at one register to keep track of this? Not going for lunch anymore.
