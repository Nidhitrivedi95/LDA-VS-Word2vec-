TxQBdyDktZSk1KVTWh71dw This was a dope little place. The food was good and the service was even better. The set up inside open and so is the kitchen. It's family friendly and there's a good amount of things to choose from. They got points because there was meatless food. The black bean burger was seasoned very well and I definitely enjoyed it. 

The queso blanco dip was pretty damn good. We went H.A.M on the dip and the chips they give you were crunchy and not oily. 

This place gets extra points because the staff (Leon), the bartender, and the hostess were all madd friendly ... and because they bring your food out as it's made and you don't gotta wait for the other suckas in your party to eat. Ha!
