826djy6K_9Fp0ptqJ2_Yag Compared to multiple other Chipotle locations, I'd day this ranks probably in the middle of the pack.

They do a pretty decent job pushing out the orders, but that should be a given at any fast food place, especially on one of the most crowded places in the Toronto core.

I don't usually mess around with my order. Just a chicken burrito with all the veg options I can possibly load up on. The taste is consistently good there. I did have one instance where I got a clump of white rice that didn't have their dressing on it - just pure white rice. Not complaining though. I AM asian after all...

The price has gone up lately, but I think it still justifies how much I still get.

The food here is good, but don't expect the real deal here for quality Mexican.
