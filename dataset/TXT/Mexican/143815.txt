JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg Great service, terrible food.  Bland and boring. My wife and I set out to sample tacos from the most popular Places on Yelp. The fact that this place made the list makes sense once you know it's next door to a gentlemen's club. Clearly, the best tacos are next door at sapphire. Flavorless beans, flavorless meat and not a drop of hot sauce available. Save your money and go to Taco and Beer.
