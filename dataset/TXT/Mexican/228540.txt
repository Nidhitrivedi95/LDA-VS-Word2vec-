SAae44V24aD7y_HpgxjhPA I've been going to this Mexican restaurant since 2015, about twice a month. There portions are huge and service used to be better than it was. They went sky rocket on prices compared to other Mexican restaurants in the area. Plus if your going to pay that much, my main complaint is stop messing up my order, than blame me! No matter if I order take out or right there at the table with the waiter standing in front of me, the order will be somehow wrong. They have new hostess, besides 1 (she's amazing- Katy), new bartenders, a lot of new waiters.
