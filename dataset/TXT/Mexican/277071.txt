Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ 1.5 hours post our reservation no food yet! We had a reservation for 14 people. STILL no table at 9:30. FINALLY after hounding them repeatedly they decided to put us in the private dining room. Our bill was nearly 1000.00 and no manager or anyone came to apologize, offer an appetizer etc. Our hotel concierge recommended this place. While it is a cool atmosphere, decent food the over all experience was the pits!
