Wzx5tF9-PaWfWSirdq8Ulg Walked in at 830 (they close at 10), there were 2 tables seated with a total of 6 people plus 7 people working plus the manager. We walked up to the line (already half broken down and two employees cleaning) and the two employees who were standing there took off their gloves and walked away without saying anything. We waited 4 minutes before a girl came over, laughing about whatever convo she just had, asking what we would like. My wife ordered the sweet pork, they're out. She ordered the new special Green chile pork, they're out. She settles for barbacoa. I order my burrito, ask for the grilled chicken, they also out. At this point, I ask for the manager. He comes out and I ask what's the deal with everything being out and how long to get what we'd like. He tells me it will be 45 mins to an hour for chicken and no more pork until tomorrow and literally laughs. An hour for grilled chicken breast? We walked out and will never return.
