rD32POdIhGN9eR8aUxl-3A Yeah, thanks girl who was in such a rush to serve me.  First I had to wait for an online order which is fine but don't look at me like I am bothering you!   I asked for black beans and she put like 1/8 cup worth in the bowl!  I said could I have more beans as I am not getting any meat or rice, yet this must have been such a horrible thing to ask as her al ready irritated demeanor morphed into this "I hate you and my job" level of anger.  I swear she didn't even TRY to drain the beans or salsa at all!! She was soooooo rude and short with me.  I just wanted to leave at that point so I let her grudgingly finish.  The  result was when I got home my leather seats (thank goodness they were not cloth) were wet with chipotle liquid.  I hadn't noticed that and when I took the bag, it BARLEY CLEARED MY CAR before the bottom of the bag gave out for the damp bowl!  Okay chipotle get a clue!!!  Maybe make the bowls more durable where everything doesn't leak out or make your bags better.   A different location on Sahara.... same thing but this time it made it to my living room floor!  Not sure if I am going back if I can't dine in.  NOT RECOMMENDED AS A TO GO RESTAURANT!!!!!
