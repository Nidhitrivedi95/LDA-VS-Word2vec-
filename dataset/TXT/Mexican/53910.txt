9Q1ZtzTPFWG4fJiFSko5Xg One iced tea, one bowl of guacamole, one sampler appetizer............$37 with tip! 
I can't see myself going back to this place. WAY too expensive for mediocre Mexican food. The guacamole made table side was good but certainly not the best I have ever tasted. I did love the complimentary chips and salsa but unfortunately it was the highlight of the meal. Everything on the sampler was just OK. 
We really wanted to love this place. It would be great to have an upscale Mexican place close to home but this place was certainly not worth the price( I don't mind spending a lot of money for something if it is good). 
The decor was nice and our wait staff was fantastic with great service from our waitress but what a Let Down in all other aspects.
