64dfRmMmUsOdLnkBOtzp4w came to celebrate a dear friend's birthday..... gallo blanco has been on my to-try list FOREVER, so i was super excited to finally get the chance to dine here - and i was not disappointed. 

we had the guac and chips - it was.... different. a little more sweet than my personal preference, but still good. 

i had the naco torta - omg, can you say sexy???? delicious char-grilled ribeye, perfectly over easy eggs and avocado.... i was in breakfast sandwich heaven. it IS a bit messy, but that's what makes it so glorious. i'm a huge fan of runny eggs!!!

i also ordered the small ensalada cortada - this may be one of my top 2 salads i've had in phoenix. it was really really amazing!!!! if this is healthy eating, i'm all in! delish!

the birthday girl ordered the chilaquiles - and while i'm not a HUGE cq fan, these were pretty darn good, and i may be tempted to order them in the future. 

for dessert, we had the lime tart and the tres leches cake. both were stunning and superb. 

i am looking forward to returning to try out the tacos during HH sometime.... and some adult beverages once i'm no longer pregnant!
