hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg This place is all hype and no substance! The food plain sucks! I had the braised beef gnocchi, which was so potent and salty. We also shared the large lobster poutine (cause the small one comes with just a few chunks of lobster), so we decided to pay $29 for this appetizer. Basically soggy mcdonalds fries with salty lobster. Main dish was some kind of Veal special that was pushed so aggresively by the waitress that we just HAD to get it. It was 5 tiny thin slices of raw veal, with a fee stalks of greenery and some paste to hold it together. Whatever happened to COOKING the meat and serving a SIDE DISH! You know, potatoes?! Roasted vegetables?! Spinach?! Anyway, we are leaving hungry and pissed. Save your money and appetite and go somewhere else!
