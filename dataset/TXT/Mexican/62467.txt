aWYWNfHuQJyRwDHaHq8X1w I was surprised to see a line when I was checking in and  guessed the food would be good. In fact, I had a taco platter and it was really good. 
* the only thing I will add is that the chips they offer to right while waiting for your order isn't free of charge. The server asked me if I want chips with salsa or guacamole. I said guacamole and it appeared on my bill. Would have been nice to let me know in advance. 
Otherwise I definitely recommend this place.
