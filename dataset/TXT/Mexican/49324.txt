8nNB_yG1gzVpbqNH2EBucg Great atmosphere, food, and margaritas!  Z'Tejas has one of the best happy hours!  The bartending team is awesome, especially Matt, and one of the reasons we keep coming back to this location. Tip: Ask for the 20th Anniversary Margarita.  Although it's no longer on the menu, they can still make it at this location and it's AMAZING!
