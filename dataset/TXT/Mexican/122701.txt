HGLMe4y0y_VsBkDLdpfBLA This would be a five star review had it not been for the hostess. It was evident that she hates her job. We weren't welcomed when we came in the door and she seemed annoyed that she had to show us to our seats. She put the menus on the table and walked away. How about an "enjoy your meal" or "you server will be right with you"? She was also inappropriately dressed with her belly hanging out from her crop top. 

But onto the positive. The man that brought our chips and salsa was friendly as was our server (Candace). She was thorough and attentive. My husband and I ordered fajitas and they were delicious! We would certainly go again!
