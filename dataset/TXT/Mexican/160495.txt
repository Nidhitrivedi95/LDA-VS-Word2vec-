kxzS-zh5nUNvBzYz2Q47pg Two of us ordered something wrapped in a flour tortilla. Had four small strips of grilled beef inside. Some tasty sauce, too. But the pillow sized flour tortilla was the meal. It must have started life the size of a $20 pizza. Only thicker. And still wet. And then it was wrapped around four small pieces of beef. Had to saw through it to find the grilled beef. Very disappointed. Spendy tortilla. Have no idea if other menu items are good or bad but the couple we were with were unhappy too.
