GC5wcui5uejRZTi8OCNPkQ This afternoon I went online to find a Mexican Restaurant near my home. I settled on Mi Casa as I have been in the Silverton many times but never dined at the restaurant. I experienced a misunderstanding with the wait staff regarding how I wanted my meal prepared and asked to see a Manager.  I was fortunate to meet Gina and Chris F.
Their level of professionalism surely exceeded my expectations.  I would highly recommend this restaurant for its quality of food and level of service. Gina and Chris listened and through their efforts left me feeling appreciated as a customer. I surely will be back.
