T2tEMLpTeSMxLKpxwFdS3g Have to try the BBQ Mahi tacos! So good, love this place! Only problem is that it's extremely loud inside. The music playing is way too loud which causes everyone to talk loud and you can't hear anything inside that place. We always request a seat outside because of the noise inside.
