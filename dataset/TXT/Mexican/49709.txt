8PBq-MHyLDrhkaTf72Foww I ordered two chicken street tacos with a side of rice.  The tacos were made with one corn tortilla. When I picked up the taco the chicken fell out of the bottom of the tortilla.  The rice was dry and hard.  I asked for fresh rice and basically got the same batch of rice.  This is the first Mexican restaurant where I had to pay for chips and salsa.  Will never eat here again!
