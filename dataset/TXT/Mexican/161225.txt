L-_-9JNAb6UDyq7waykX2A I wouldnt recommend this place at all. The food is not bad, but the service is horrible. The waitress are slow and dont seem to care. Even in slow days they still take for ever to do anything, even refills. We have placed several to go orders because we feel that way we dont have to deal with them, but even on to go orders they still make mistakes. The management should encourage more hospitality on the waitresse's behalf because this place seems to not really care about their customers. Most of the time is packed but there are a lot of aspects to improve.
