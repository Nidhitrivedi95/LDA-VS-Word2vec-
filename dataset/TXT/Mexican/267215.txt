wJ84TZZTuT0EdLzPHt8RDw Had an amazing lunch! Food was hot, fresh!
I love Mexican food, and grew up in the valley,
Everything was perfect!
I notice the reviews were negative, however, wanted to give it a try-we live in the neighborhood! So glad we did!
Ellen was our sever, she provided the best service!
We will be back to see her
Thank you Ellen!
