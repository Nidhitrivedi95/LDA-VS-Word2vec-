woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ People had been raving to me about Täko and I have to say that I was rather disappointed when I finally made it there for dinner. It is quite a small restaurant and reservations for dinner go weeks in advance. You can eat at the bar without a reservation and it turns over relatively quickly, but you might be waiting for a bit. You can make a reservation on their website through Yelp SeatMe. I went with my boyfriend and we had to shout at each other and still couldn't really hear one another. It is incredibly loud in there. It is also so dark you can hardly see the menu or what you're eating. The decor is very confused, with some metal lockers, Christian paraphernalia, and black/red decor that might be found in a dungeon. It was rather dreadful of an atmosphere (the bar looks slightly better since it is a tiny bit better lit and you are sitting right next to anyone you go with, which should make hearing them a little easier). We started off with the house-made guacamole and were not at all impressed with it. I had the mushrooms tacos which were quite tasty, but not enough so to go there again. I had a pretty good mezcal-based drink. The prices were quite high for what we were getting.
