I've tasted Filiberto's and it can't even hold a candle to Vaquero's Carne Asada fries.  I didn't know well-cooked fries topped with a humungous amount of meat, guacamole, sour cream, and cheese could be heaven on earth. One $7 take-out box could feed 4 people easily. I always make sure to bring a box home if I ever have guests and they usually end up loving it equally - or more so than me.

I've recently discovered this hole-in-the-wall and honestly, I've been coming back at least twice a month since then. It'll satisfy all your authentic Mexican food cravings especially since they're open 24 hrs!
