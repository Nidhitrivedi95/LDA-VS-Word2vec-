QI-CI9wWRxtw60_aQK1BpA Super delicious! My vegan friend ordered one of the eggplant dishes (I can't remember which) and it was slightly sweet (a natural sweet from the veggies) and delicious. We went here on a whim, so I didn't realize it was Sri Lankan until the waiter suggested I change my order from the Chicken Masala (always an easy go-to for Indian food) to the Chicken and Potato Curry. He was right and I was very glad I did! It had tons of flavor and a lot of depth and was definitely a Sri Lankan curry as opposed to Indian. Portions were large, but we both finished our plates... leftovers for people at home/lunch tomorrow be damned! Sadly this left no room for dessert, so no comment there.

As for spiciness level... We both ordered mild to be safe and there was no heat at all in either dish. The waiter recommended I try Mild+ next time since I was looking for more heat. So that sounds like heat level is super customizable depending on your palate, which is always great. 

My friend and I stayed a long time after we finished eating and they were very nice about leaving us alone but refilling our waters.

Great place - I'll definitely be back!
