mFGUvyJSdSRjIaN94QW_IQ Fun little restaurant I'm a strip mall.
We have eaten here for breakfast and lunch many times... great food.... super cute decoratimg.
And good service. Everything is very clean and this is just a really nice little spot to eat! Prices are reasonable and margaritas are great!
