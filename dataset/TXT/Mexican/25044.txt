2Yq-Y-tDroP7mdDfcWJLCQ I can't believe I haven't written a review of this place... or have I?

At any rate. I loooooove this place. I luckily work a mile down the road, and get to frequent this place on a weekly basis if needed. It was seriously a Godsend when i was battling a bad flu and made daily trips for some menudo or consomme to lift my spirits. Seriously, some of the best Mexican soups I've EVER had, including homemade menudo. I cannot get enough of the soups! The owner (I really should know his name, because he knows mine....) knows me by my phone orders, hah!

The prices are incredibly reasonable, but it is easy to rack up a bill here because you will always want one of each kind of taco, etc etc. My husband loves the fish tacos and memelitas, I love the soups and ..... yeah, I pretty much like everything here.  And I think I've tried almost everything too! Some things (like the uber cheesy quesadilla) may not be the healthiest, but gosh darn it, I love this place. And I want everyone else to love it too. Just not when I'm trying to pick up my take-out order.
