wWmFZerHP37Nqwc7ix0bVg I'm on the fence about this place. Price was decent for what you get. Food isn't bad. My only complaint would be the fact that the filling was so sparse. I ordered chicken tacos and there was 90% chunks of onion instead of the actual chicken. It gave off a cheap impression to me.
