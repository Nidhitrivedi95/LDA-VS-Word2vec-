FVgHb9w4pnkRBV5bZYJaZA Taco Mich is my favorite local mexican food around GCU. This location is the main location while the one on camelback is one of the sister locations, the aunt owns that one. Taco Tuesday's are on Wednesday here just FYI. The food is great I can't say it enough. Drunk, late night munchies, or a quick dinner -this place can do the job. The price is right which makes it better. It's all fresh food too. I'lll never go to a 'bertos again.
