OTcBXjDkViDPds4Lxy8KIQ This is now my favorite breakfast burrito spot in the Henderson area. 

I have tried both Fausto's and Roberto's, but they did not really impress me too much. After seeing reviews of Carlito's Burritos, I desperately wanted to come by and try them out. 

Today, I ordered the breakfast burrito with ham/sausage/bacon. The burrito was a decent size but smaller than I expected. The burrito was definitely hearty and they are generous with their ingredients. Most breakfast burrito spots will try to fill their burritos with fillers (potato, rice, etc), but this burrito was 85% egg & meat and 15% potato. I liked that the hash browns in the burrito were extra crispy. It adds additional texture to the burrito.
