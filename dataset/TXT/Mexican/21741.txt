2GzQ1Cc7eDWhKrqNAR1kAA One of the best Chipotles I've ever been to! First off the service is very welcoming and they greet you as soon as you walk through the door. They are very quick to get you through the line while being courteous and friendly. I used to live nearby and was a frequent customer until I moved away and still drive by a chipotle to continue going to this one. Last but not least the food quality is great and always fresh.  As I said before I have been here many times and have never left with a problem.
