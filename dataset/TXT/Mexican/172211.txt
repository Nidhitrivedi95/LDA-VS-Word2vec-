mB_cI1tCrNxxvr2e2myNrQ Ooookay. This place is a hot mess between the hours of 2AM and 3AM because everyone is thinking the same thing -- damn, I'm drunk. damn, I'm hungry. damn, Taco Bell sounds bomb.

And let's be real. You only really crave Taco Bell when you're not in a total state of consciousness.

This Taco Bell Cantina is open 24/7 and yes, they do have alcoholic slushies. I was pleasantly surprised that the prices at this place seem to be on par with other Taco Bells. No price gouging for late night munchies here! The boyfriend and I shared a cravings box (shhh, don't tell my diet) that cost about $5, and we were both totally stuffed.

We didn't try their alcoholic slushies, but the reaction that I'm hearing is that there's not much alcohol taste. 

There's some space to sit and chill on the second floor and also some outdoor patio area to hang around. Music is thumping here, so if you're not looking for another place where you have to yell to have a conversation, look elsewhere.
