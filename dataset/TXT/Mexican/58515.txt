aEGV0W2i8HRoDFsRrMz-BA I definitely should have read the reviews before ordering.
The only reason this isn't getting five stars is due to how long it took to get food. It took two hours. Now I've worked in restaurants I get having a busy restaurant & it taking a bit more time for deliveries, but I feel if it's taking two hours for delivery then maybe it shouldn't be an option? Maybe just stick to dine in & carry out.
Other than the ridiculous time to wait, the food was delicious. For how long it took to get it we were actually surprised it was hot. The enchilada style burrito was so good, really filling! We also got the three taco combo with carne asada which was really good as well!
Overall this place has great food quality. We will definitely enjoy this place again, next time dining in instead of delivery.
