eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw Went to eat here today and the hostesses looked at each other and said it was an hour wait yet it looked empty inside. They claimed that there was 2 parties coming that would take up all the tables. I felt very suspicious as if they were lying so I called nacho daddy and asked if there was a wait. The man said there was no wait. Then I explained the story and he said let me find out. The manager "Kelly" gets on the phone and says yes there's an hour wait because you have a minor with you. That was never said by the hostesses. The manager never said there was a big party coming in either. Not really sure why the manager would lie but never coming here again.
