XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg We made reservations for four at 10:00PM. If you do not make the reservation you will be charged a fee. Two of the party showed up 15 minutes early and were told that we could not be seated until the rest of the party arrived. At 9:50PM our party was complete but the hostess would not seat us. We went up to find out why and the hostess was seating walk ins. We asked to be seated at an open table and eventuality at 10:05 we were seated without menus. At 10:15 I asked the hostess for menus and was told that they sat us to shut us up and that security was going to remove us from the restaurant. Security showed up and laughed when asked to have us removed. We eventually got our menus at 10:30PM and was served after people that were sat after us. Service was horrible and I believe because two of our party were gay we were discriminated against. It would make it much easier to avoid these kind of restaurants if they would make that claim before we made a reservation.
