pDewiJY6KCcZgLxxgxg13Q I used to frequent this restaurant until what happened to me on April 3rd.  I invited some guests to dine with us, the meal was as always excellent, and service was decent.  All was fine until I got a call 90 minutes after leaving the restaurant from my credit card company at 10pm asking me if I was at Frys Grocery and had just before been at Home Depot, seeing as I was at home I replied no.  I had left my credit card in the check presenter and somehow it made it's way to into someones hands that obviously was not me.  To say I was annoyed would be an understatement, that is until I called the owner the next day and explained the gravity of the situation, she had the nerve to tell me that it was basically my fault and that her staff would never do anything like that and that she would do nothing about it, not even an apology!! In the days of Social Media, not taking customers seriously is risky business, i have shared this story with 50 plus people and I am sure they have shared it with some more.  I have left my credit card at several restaurants over the years and have always been confident in the honesty of a business and next day retrieved it and not had someone go shopping in my absence.  Visit this restaurant at your own peril and if you have to pay cash!!
