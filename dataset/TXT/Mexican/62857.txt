aXRrMXXoAN7lawHICgmsxw This place is fantastic and represents everything what a DTPHX spot should be! The trifecta, really --- 1) great cocktails 2) great service 3) great atmosphere. Oh, the music was on point, too. 

Super friendly and accommodating staff/bartender (as in not so much as an involuntary shudder nor flinch when we asked for our drinks made slightly differently). The craft cocktails are delicious and half off during happy hour. Also, BIG ICE CUBES. I ordered the cold soba salad which was flavorful fresh and healthy - an excellent post aerial yoga snack - the cocktails? Not so much, but HEY, live a little! 

We sat outside on the patio on an unseasonably beautiful day overlooking this handsome, rusty shipping container kitchen. The unisex (multisex? gender neutral?) bathroom was sexy, too. Modern and clean.
