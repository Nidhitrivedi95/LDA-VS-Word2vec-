xFN8mRubo3G0oIzJwc8XBA I generally avoid any restaurant ending in berto's like the plague because I am afraid of food poisoning that results in explosive diarrhea. 

Yesterday I realized I forgot my lunch and I only had 15 minutes to get lunch. I hopped in my car and started driving to see what I could find that was close & fast. 

I saw Filiberto's and threw caution to the wind!

I got a burrito with chicken, rice, beans, & cheese. It was amazingly delicious! Something this good has to be really, really bad for me I'm sure, but OMFG it was so great!

I am thinking about it right now. Holy cow, I am craving Filiberto's. I guess I'm going to have to live on the edge and chance eating at Filiberto's again...
