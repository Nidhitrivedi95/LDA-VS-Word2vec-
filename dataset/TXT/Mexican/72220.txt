c9PkUjunOI49r9oO4ZJcmQ As a (former) fan of Taco Bell, I'm sad to to have to write this review. Tonight, my friend and I decided to treat ourselves to a nice meal at your restaurant. Unfortunately, it ended up being a horrible experience. As someone who cannot eat dairy and chooses not to eat meat, I was extremely careful in describing what I wanted: a burrito with no cheese and no beef. The cashier repeated it back to me at least 3 times, so I was confident she understood what I wanted. After getting our meal, I bit into my burrito to discover it consisted SOLEY of beef and cheese. I'm extremely saddened and sick by this encounter and only hope that you can improve for future patrons. Also, I know it's not this location's personal fault, but the diablo sauce sucks.
