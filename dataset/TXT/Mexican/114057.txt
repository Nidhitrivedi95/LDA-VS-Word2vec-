The restaurant was extremely busy and our food came out at very odd times resulting in half the group being finished before the other half had even gotten their tacos. 

Morgan did an awesome job of accommodating our group (10 people). She managed to split the bills which was no easy feat and was friendly and helpful the whole time.
