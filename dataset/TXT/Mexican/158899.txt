ksuxxeP_V73Y4iKPeLq77A It's not the worst food ever. Kind of just did this restaurant stuff spontaneously. I had the grilled fish tacos and they were pretty good, wasn't a fan of rice and beans. The guacamole was really good. 

The alcohol, 48 oz margarita, was absolutely great. I had strawberry and mango. It's like $20 for the biggest one. 

Our server was really nice, she had a lot on her plate so just a little slow. Overall, an okay experience.
