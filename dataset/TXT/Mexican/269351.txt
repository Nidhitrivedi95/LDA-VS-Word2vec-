Without reservation, was able to get seated within 5 minutes on the Wednesday before New Year's Eve.  To wait for a few here is a treat, as they have a very unique setup where 3 walls of the kitchen are behind glass (facing inside the dining room/bar, the foyer, and the street) - always love places that expose the kitchen to the guests.

The newspaper menu is quite creative, seems to be a growing a trend which I'm a fan.  I also liked how simple it is, maybe 8 or so appetizers and about the same for the tacos with some daily specials for consideration.  Drinks were awesome, the oxaca old fashioned is small but packed punch and flavor, same for the Diablo margarita (bigger, 8-10 oz drink).  We started with a recommended guacamole which had tuna and some Asian flavoring which was delicious and portion matches the price.  Tacos were all good, however the house special octopus and the bistec were superior.

Only stumble was the last round of drinks came out slowly and did not seem to be a function of volume of people at the bar.  Minor blemish in and otherwise very good experience.

Pittsburgh price '$$' seem inconsistent to me, if it helps I got an app, 4 tacos and 5 drinks for ~$130.
