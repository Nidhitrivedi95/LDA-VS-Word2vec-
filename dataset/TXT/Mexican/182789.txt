NjDC1Evc2Wa6ykj8xVpoUw so I went in and I spent $700 and I got down to my last 20 bucks around 1:30 AM and the bartender told me I had 10 minutes till they close even though they close at 2 AM. I've never felt more uncomfortable and unwanted after to tipping $50 and only having to serve me three glasses of wine. Also the fish tacos didn't have the sauce that they normally have on them. All around it was a terrible experience and I will never be going back. The bartenders name is Tony she was the worst. Basically a terrible experience
