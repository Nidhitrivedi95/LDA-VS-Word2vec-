WlBvw6R1Qe2yIaZp-2ilZA My husband and I stopped in here for an early dinner.  We don't remember what he had, which should tell you something and I had the fish tacos.  This was some of the worse food we've gotten in the year we've lived in Vegas.  We mentioned it to server and rec'd an "oh sorry", but no effort to rectify the problem.  Not even if we were starving would we go back.
