I preferred the barbacoa, but both were flavorful. Also, I asked for extra cilantro and onion, and they readily agreed. No problems.  My guy had a Carne asada breakfast burrito which he said was good but a little on the dry side.  We loved the BYOB feature and picked up a couple drinks at the liquor store next door. Overall, if I'm on that side of town, I'd visit again.
