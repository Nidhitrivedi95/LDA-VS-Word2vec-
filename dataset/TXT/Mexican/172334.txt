mB_cI1tCrNxxvr2e2myNrQ Say What?! Putting a place like Taco Bell Cantina on the strip AND making it 24 hours was one of the best ideas EVER... like seriously it's a Taco Bell on steroids! So I've known it's been open for a while but how often as a local do we really travel on down to the strip if it's not absolutely necessary? Anyways my niece flew out from Minneapolis for her bachelorette party and I somehow got talked into walking the strip and "turning up" with her and some of the bridesmaids. SO fun! Well after all that walking and drinking you know what happens after a while right? You get hungry! As we were headed down the escalators from Planet Hollywood we saw this HUGE billboard with Taco Bell featuring this new Doritos Chicken Nugget thing, sounds gross right, but it wasn't and I don't know if it was the alcohol or not but it looked pretty damn good to me. When you first arrive they have some security that is checking ID's for all those underage kids trying to be grown and drink. NOPE! This place was awesome once you are in they play some really good music and the vibes are just amazing. We had people dancing in the line with each other and just having a good time. Hell if I didn't know any better I would've thought that this was CLUB TACO BELL! I was all for it! The fact that they have a ton of different frozen mixed drinks to wash down your late night meal is even better! Did I mention that they also have some pretty awesome souvenirs and Taco Bell Apparel?! Dope! Once you place your order they actually take your name and have it put up on a screen so you know that your order is being worked on. Like many other places there is that once person that has the coolest job of calling out your name when it is ready... There is always that one person who like to give a funny name just so that when they scream it out it's redundant but FUNNY! Overall we had a blast here and I can honestly say I shall return!
