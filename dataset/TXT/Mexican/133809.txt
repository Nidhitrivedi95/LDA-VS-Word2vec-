IgQ8lSds3AgLFQsYsshUHQ My fiancé and I stopped by for a quick dinner here after having tacos at another location (Aurora). We were a bit disappointed with the quality of food here after having a good experience at the other location. We ordered 3 tacos (chicken tinga, chorizo, and a beef one) and a taco salad. The chicken tinga taco was delicious and perfectly topped. It was the first taco we had, so it set the bar high for the other two. The chorizo taco was dry and definitely missing something. It had a drizzle of guacamole and a whole lot of chopped red onion on it. When we had the beef taco, we were disappointed because it was also dry and lacking. We asked for the chipotle aioli they put on the chicken tinga taco and the guy at the counter happily gave it to us without a charge. The taco salad was alright. A lot of cheese and not much else. The salad comes with guacamole for you to dip your taco shell in, but I really wasn't feeling the taco shell or guacamole. Their guacamole is way too smooth. I'm used to it being chunkier. The texture kind of reminded me of baby food.

Service was friendly. We were their last customers and dined in, so when we were finishing up and ready to clean up after ourselves, the guy at the counter told us he would do it for us, which was nice.
