The food was good but the manager verbally abusing my family because I complained about a dog sitting in a seat eating from a  Barrio Queen plate. The manager didn't care and was apologizing to the dog's family. The hotness encouraged the dog to go on the chair and eat, was petting the dog then went and was touching cutlery.  The manager Jeff then proceeded to follow me and my family out to the parking lot cursing. Over terrible experience.
