1GoI8TV5ngDEqoTmDK6Iow Ajo Al's is a fantastic restaurant that is more if a family than anything else. The food is so good but the ownership and wait staff are genuine and kind people. I have eaten there multiple times this week and not once did I have a bad meal or experience. They have been around for 20 years for good reason.
