I went to Thrival Fest last weekend and tried a taco after long last!! I have followed them on Instagram for some time but never got around to it. Boy was that a mistake! I don't think I can say enough wonderful things about the taco I had, but I will try. They had a very small and to the point menu, with one vegetarian option, so that is what I ordered. The tacos were $4 each and absolutely perfectly sized for the price. They don't short you on the filling! Enough filling that I ate it with a fork. You have an option of corn or flour tortillas, which is also excellent. Although I have heard good things about their corn tortillas, I opted for the flour just because I like flour tortillas better. I'm a poser, I know! 

The filling for the veg taco was perfectly spicy and all around a really excellent taco. They seem to have a different sort of taco for their restaurant menu as opposed to the food truck menu when it comes to vegetarians/vegans, so I will have to swing by the southside and try it! Definitely recommend!
