0G1y7uV7w1D2uziS4Lt_Dw My friend and I ate here on vacation, and we were largely unimpressed. Our server was abrupt and unfriendly. I got a beef burrito but was surprised when it came out with no sauce on top (it was just a simple tortilla with beef and beans in it). It would have been very plain had I not poured some of the chip salsa on top. My friend got a shrimp dish which he thought was decent.
