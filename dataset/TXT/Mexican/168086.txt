lv5Bnqlt93NnvNJ2oNcQ8Q I was excited to finally try this place but it was not at all what I expected.  I ordered the stuffed avocado with chicken. The chicken was bland but the breading was good. I also ordered a side of flour tortillas because I love homemade flour tortillas.  Those were not fully cooked. My husband ordered the ranchero style burrito with red sauce on top. The sauce looked delicious so it took a piece of my half cooked tortilla and dipped it into the sauce. Boy I thought I was in for a real treat that was my reaction.  The sauce tasted like ragu meat sauce oh I was dumbfounded. Really spaghetti sauce??? I thought maybe it was just the sauce on my husband's burrito so I tried the sauce from my daughter's enchilada  same ragu sauce.   We asked about the sauce and we were told that it was Texas style hmmmm.  I am Mexican and from California so I know good Mexican food. This is not for me.  I am not from Texas so granted I don't know Texas Mexican food.  Our waitress was great though and the service was good.  The manager did come and ask how we liked our food and my husband told him the sauce tasted like spaghetti sauce<U+200D> I then added it was just different from what we are used to.   Anyway even though I was excited to find out they had a Sunday brunch buffet not somewhere I will be returning to.
