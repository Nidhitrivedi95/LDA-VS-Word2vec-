SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA This was my first visit, We wanted Mexican food so started looking around for someplace we have not tried before. Most of what we found where counter style places but this one stood out, so we decided to give it a try.

   Its off on the west side so people from the strip over have to travel a bit but let me tell you ts worth it. They share a parking lot with some other businesses that are not open at night so plenty of parking. Oh did I mentioned its next to an In and Out? 

   The restaurant has to seating areas the bar and the main dinning. The bar looks a little dark compared to the main dinning but looked inviting also. We sat in the main area, let me tell you its a bit of show with flames shooting up from almost every direction.. They ignite the fajitas table side with a nice shot of tequila.  I myself have not tried them but they look fantastic  and smell wonderful.

    The menu has lots of options and will cover just about any ones taste.  They start you off with chips beans and 2 salsas, one green ( which I preferred ) and one red (this on was a bit bitter to me ). But both tasty. 

    The staff is very efficient we did not have to ask for a thing. they kept us filled on chips and drinks and food was done in a timely manner and served very hot. The staff continued to check on us to make sure everything was on par. The food was fantastic, good flavor and you can tell not bag and box seasoning. Portion where large we had enough for a second meal at home the next day.

   Juan's has become part of my top five in Las Vegas closer to the top of that list. I can say with confidence I will be back many times in the near future.  

     If you get a chance to be in the area of Juan's I highly recommend you pay them a visit.. you wont be disapointed
