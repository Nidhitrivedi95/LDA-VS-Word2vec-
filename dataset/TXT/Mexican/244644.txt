TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag Great local Spanish style food market. I recommend their meats, for they are very flavorful. Not like the bland meats Americans are used to at our over produced and over priced flavorless corporate crap.  Their produce here is not very fresh, so don't expect to get a whole lot in that department. I do enjoy their tomatillas because they are always in stock and good. Also, you have to get the tamales or fesh premade salsas and guacamole!!! High demand there! Very friendly staff. I really enjoy shopping at LA Plaza and happy with the easy accessible location.
