GRs6OxKZREAwA_Nmp2GmVw With so many different fast food Mexican shops in Arizona, many people end up choosing the chain ones like Filibertos and Robertos and all those ertos joints. Well Amado's doesn't end with that suffix but their food does everything and beyond suffice. I've been here over 10+ times in the last year (or two) and the quality is never less than superb. My favorite is Fish Taco meal, which has the perfect combination of crunchy and savory toppings in a flour tortilla. Rolled tacos are fresher than most restaurants in the area. I've brought many friends with me here and I've made every person come back on their own because of the quality and price. Gotta try the Amado's Breakfast burrito too!
