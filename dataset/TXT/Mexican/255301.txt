vCcnawY4Q41A1rlnxKBzkA THE best Mexican food I've had since moving to Arizona from so-cal!!! Being from the Los Angeles area there's nothing but delicious Mexican food and moving  to Chandler was one of the most depressing things because there's noting but chain restaurants. I was pleasantly surprised when I found this place. I knew it was going to be good when you see a long line! I wish a had a picture of my food but that was the last thing on my mind when I got the baby home ( Carne Asada búrado)$6.99. I recommend to anybody who wants a great meal for not a lot of money.
