3SLDrXzPmKF0iCY8WriLsA Not completely terrible but not good.  In case you are unfamiliar, it is basically a greasier, unhealthier version of Chipotle with a stoner/punk rock feel.  This location opened up across the street from a Chipotle (not smart) and feels way too polished and without character.  If you want Chronic Taco, stick with the Mill Ave location.  I'm not planning on returning here...
