RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg I had the al pastor tacos and holy shit. People aren't joking about the line but it was worth it 100x over. The tacos were delicious and way cheaper than a lot of other food near the strip. Definitely recommend getting more than you think you want. I instantly regretted not buying more when I finished mine. Will be returning to this little gem when I come back to Vegas.
