However, the service leaves much to be desired...We sat at the bar and had chips, salsa, guac and margaritas. It took FOREVER for EVERYTHING! It took a while for us to even get menus, then for the bar tender to take our order, and then the bartender forgot our drinks order, so we had to ask someone else, and then the bartender didn't put in our whole order (even though we only ordered 2 things), so they we had to wait for them to bring out the salsa... The salsa was mediocre and the guac was underwhelmingly plain. The chips were actually pretty good. The margaritas were also mediocre. 
And then we had to go through this cycle again of trying to find someone to give us the check. We were going to pay with credit card, but it took so long that we ended up just paying with cash and leaving. 
Ambiance-wise, this seemed like a pretty mediocre Tex-Mex/Americanized Mexican joint. Also, they had some interesting choices for their TVs surrounding the bars. One had infomercials, just infomercials: vitamin supplements, prostate issues. Another TV had cartoons. If you're going to make your customers wait indefinitely, at least put something interesting on TV to keep them entertained.
