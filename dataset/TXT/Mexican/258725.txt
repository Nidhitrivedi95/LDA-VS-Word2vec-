vMyeUHW3QxbXD4_KxmwduA Food was so-so. I had the fish tacos and it was pretty bland/safe. It didnt see very authentic- there was no flavor! I had to use a bunch of their hot sauce/salsa to spice it up. That was also an issue- their salsa with the chips and salsa was bland. They served their house salsa w my food and it was also just spicy but not flavorful.  I would not come back.  I would gladly hit up a taco truck 3x for the money I spent here. 

On a positive note- their specialty drinks like horchata and lemonade are humongus. And their desserts are massive as well.
