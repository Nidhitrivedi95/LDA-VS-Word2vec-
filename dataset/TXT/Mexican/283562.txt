XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg party of 10 on saturday night, 6pm

service was great - he made sure to ask if we were going to a show, and we were.  so he kept us on time and ushered us out so we could get there on time.  

the best thing all night was the shrimp and corn tamale - that had great flavor and was a unique dish.  

we ordered several things off the menu but i had the lamb porterhouse chop - large serving, cooked medium rare.  tasty but didn't blow my mind.  friends ordered the tuna steak, rabbit and salmon dishes - all were ok.  for the price you pay, you're really just getting big portions and little on flavor, technique or originality.  

overall, it's a very expensive steakhouse.  mediocre, nothing terrible, nothing great.  given that there are so many good places in vegas to eat, i would not recommend spending your money on this one.
