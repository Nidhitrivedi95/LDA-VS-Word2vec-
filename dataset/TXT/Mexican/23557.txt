2Ow-hFjuUJNrOJelKjfj6w Came here because my pregnant wife was craving tacos. After waiting 15 minutes in a drive thru line that was not moving, we decided to go inside. We walked in there a guest waiting, so we waited. No cashier in site. There were 2 cashiers at the drive thru and kept apologizing for the wait. So after a few minutes we said excuse me, does anybody work here!? And she goes oh yes hold on. She calls some girl from the back and continues to tell her she has guest in line. Just as she was coming up, the guy who was making tacos, had gloves on and came around the corner and touched the dirty ass bar with the same gloves he's using to make tacos. That's when we said absolutely not, and left. The cashier continues to say, "you don't want anything?" Absolutely not I said and took my business elsewhere. Not only did you have me waiting for over 20 minutes for some damn tacos but you wanna be dirty too?! No thank you. EAT WITH CAUTION!!!!!
