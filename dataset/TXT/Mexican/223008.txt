ru35Z92NtGynsmw0iZDarQ Love ordering from here for dinner. The street tacos are delicious, i prefer the chicken tacos but the al pastor and carne asada tacos are yummy as well. My family and I order about 26 tacos, either chicken, al pastor, or carne asada and we put them in the middle of the table and randomly choose which we eat. It doesn't matter which we choose because they're all good. Also, I order myself their chicken soup. all it comes with is part of a chicken, carrots, broth and if you want a side a rice. Super tasty, love the soup on a cold night.
