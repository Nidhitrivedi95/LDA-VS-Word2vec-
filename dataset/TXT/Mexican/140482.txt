Not a lot of places offer those around here. This doesn't have the attitude or the high prices that a lot of the "contemporary " Mexican food placed have in the area and that is a good thing as far as I'm concerned. I don't think Mexican food should cost $30 - $50! Though I haven't sat out there, they also have a nice patio on the side.
