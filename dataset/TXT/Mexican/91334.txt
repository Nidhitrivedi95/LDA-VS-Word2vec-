DyOzNIeXUksPNLXYHnB-oQ Sooooooo...as I've mentioned, I love Three Amigos. So when I heard they opened Sabor, I made it a priority to go. The people working there were super nice. They have a wide selection of drinks. I ordered a shrimp burrito and my fella ordered a tilapia one (we are still doing the pescatarian diet or else he would've gotten steak). We also shared some queso. It was yummy! I loved everything about our food. It was fresh, hot, packed with flavor and a ton of food. It was the only meal we ate that day because it was so much food. I can't wait to try more things the next time we go back. 
Thumbs up.
