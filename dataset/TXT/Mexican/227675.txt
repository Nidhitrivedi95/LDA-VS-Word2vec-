S3qs5ZAZgqDvM88jj17hbQ If you are a visitor to Montreal.  Avoid this place like the plague.

My first impression was 'WOW", there is a large crowd at this mexican restaurant both inside and out.  So this must be the spot for mexican food in Montreal.  "FOOOOOOOOLLLLED YOU", Darth Hemet voice from Spaceballs.

We were seated promptly upstairs and then came the chips and salsa test.  The salsa was not good.  It was bland and didnt have flavor.  The chips were on the border of being almost stale.  We should have walked away at this point.  Nope.  We ordered a margarita and a cadillac margarita.  AWFUL!  The drink came out with a lot of foam and neither my girlfriend nor I could taste and tequila.  All we tasted was the sweet and sour mix.  Plus there was a lot of foam at the top of the drink.  Weird.  I have never had a margarita with this amount of foam on top.  

We ordered one appetizer which was the combo.  Came with flautas (decent), chicken wings (good), potato skins (blah), and cheese quesidillas (decent).  The wings were the only good part of this meal.

The even worst part was when the bill came out.  42 bucks (including tip)!  Yeah a major rip off for two drinks and an appetizer.

I should have went with my gut and avoided a mexican restaurant in Montreal since I live in the mecca of great mexican food. SOCAL!  And the best part, I went to Don Jose this past tuesday and spent 30 bucks including tip and a cadillac margarita, three regular margaritas and a macho nachos. Ha!

Cheers.
