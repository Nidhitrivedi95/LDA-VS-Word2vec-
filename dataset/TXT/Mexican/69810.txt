btA8NopfIYf7MAJ-KwhI3A I intended on going to LaUnica,  but wasn't thrilled with the food the last time. I saw this cute little Columbian place in the same parking lot and thought I would give it a try. Glad I did!  The food was fresh,  authentic, and the staff were all very pleasant.  I tried the Empanads,  and they were a nice spin on the kind I'm used to. Made with corn cake instead of the customary pastry shells or tortillas. Very good!  I'll definitely be back to try more items.  Great place to go if you want "home cooked" Columbian food.  Just what I was looking for.
