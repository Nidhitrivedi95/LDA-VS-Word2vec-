iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg I remember I had eaten here a long time ago, and it was Baja fish I ordered.  My impression was it tastes absolutely delicious.  The ingredients tastes quite fresh and well balanced.  The taco was loaded with piping hot toppings and it was sumptuous for a fish taco.  The hot sauce is great and can burn you up if not prepared.  I didn't come here very often because of the usual long line up, and there was not much standing area inside and felt very crowded inside with the line up.  Had this another day during lunch time when line up wasn't too crazy.  Still took a good 15 min wait.  Ordered grill octopus and catch of the day.  This time around the impression is still good, but not like the first time.  The taco is still loaded with topping, but something doesn't feel right.  First of all the octopus didn't taste that fresh and it was overloading the tortilla made it really messy to eat.  The catch of day was good but not memorable like first time.  Maybe I should have stick with Baja fish and gobenator.  Overall it's a good place to grab a quick bite provided the line up is not crazy.
