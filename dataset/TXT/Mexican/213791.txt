qWi9dNGo9D9I4F9RANc-6g I wanted to go to Momocho for lunch but since they don't open until 5, I decided to try El Carnicero. The menu was very similar (if not identical) to Momocho. The interior was very similar as well. 

We ordered a margarita sampler - the spicy mango was still the best, while the cucumber and pineapple were very refreshing. 

The goat cheese guac was still on point and the chicken tacos were well seasoned and grilled to perfection. My husband had the carnitas which he enjoyed. He wound up having two fatty hunks in his meal and the chef was nice enough to bring out him some extra pieces. 

We sat at the bar and service was really good.
