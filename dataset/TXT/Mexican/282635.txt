XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Good: 5 Stars, the most amazing meal I've had in ages - thought Bobby Flay's restaurant would just trade on his celebrity status, but really the food was phenomenal. Also reasonably priced for the quality of the food:

Bad: Service - we had a waitress who just wanted to chat it seemed like. I don't know why, but it seems as if she spent half the time just standing over us and talking about Los Angeles, what we did, etc... 

Ugly: Our group tipped $50 on a $300 meal (which is just north of 15% which we thought was generous considering the service and the non-stop chatting) as we were getting up to leave she says to us "did you mean to only tip $50?" 

Normally the last encounter with the waitress would have ruined the evening for us, but the food was just that good!!!
