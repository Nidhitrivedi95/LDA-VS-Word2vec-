iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg With almost 300 reviews and 4.5 stars this was a place I had to check out.  I was not disappointed... It really is worth 5 stars.  They were very busy and seeing that it was cash only, I went to the bank to get some cash.  At first the crowd inside was a bit intimidating because I wanted to be able to sit and enjoy my food.   The crowd moves quickly ... Both in getting the food and in freeing up space to sit and grab a bite.  There are stand up places to eat as well.  We ordered the cactus and mushroom and the mahi mahi as the carnitas were all sold out for the day.  Loved the prices as jt only came to $11 and included a fresh papaya juice for only $2.  The juice was phenomenal!  I can't believe they only charge $2 for it.  Both tacos were amazing and the salsa too!  Tried the green (medium) salsa and then went back for the hot one.  Both were amazing and the hot one was worthy of being called hot.  Amazing taco experience and would recommend and return.
