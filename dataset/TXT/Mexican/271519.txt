WPkUWu5Ja_lAx0XljgPF7A Unsuspecting hotel bar with incredible food. We came here because of the yelp reviews but were a little sceptical when we found out it was inside of an Embassy Suites. The atmosphere is not amazing but the food is fantastic! The wait staff is incredibly nice and attentive . . . we will definitely go back! Tip: the bruschetta is delicious!
