G4hjhtA_wQ-tSOGpgGlDjw This is an interesting place located next to super burrito.  I just felt like ceviche and figured they had it.

They did and it was small, but good.  The menu is limited and the prices (IMO) were high.  So high that I only had the one dish.  

I also had an ice tea for
Which they only had sugar ... I was the only one in the place which was kind of strange.  I dunno if this place can make it...
