fGnILhhgE393e-8X9JIB4Q I love authentic Mexican food and it's really hard to find in TO, especially in the 905. Maybe you'll find a good tacos al asador, but it'll be in a flour tortilla... or a great burrito, but it'll come with store bought salsa and guacamole...

La Taquiza is like a sit down taqueria because they specialize in authentic tacos. Their pico de gallo is freshly made as well as their other salsas at their walk up salsa bar.

The owner is super friendly and couldn't stop talking about how he imported the tiles from Mexico, how he designed the restaurant by himself, the slow cooking process for his tacos al pastor, how it's so hard to find poblano peppers in TO...

The place is kind of tacky, but hey, I've never been to a restaurant in Mexico that wasn't! The food is what you're here for and it's authentic Mexican. Not bad by TO standards where most people expect their tacos to come with ground beef, sour cream, shredded cheese, and hard tortilla shells!
