ywF14Amq9SLX5o8Qnx3hgA This place has potential, and obviously a lot of customers.  Unfortunately they are really unorganized, and wait times are ridiculous.  I ordered a big plate of red menudo.  When our food came out, I was not impressed at all.  
The flavor was lacking, as an experienced menudo cooker, some tips for the cooks in the back: 

 1.  hominy should be cooked in the broth so it can absorb some flavor 

2.  The broth needs a whole lot of flavor, throw some more garlic and onions in there!

I hope this place can rehabilitate itself and become a menudo hotspot in Las Vegas, we desperately need it!
