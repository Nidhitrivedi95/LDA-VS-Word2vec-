zwNC-Ow4eIMan2__bS9-rg All I can say is omfg!!! I've been looking for the perfect taco place. You know the place that has the perfectly marinated and so tender carne asada, and fresh delicious tasty chicken! This is my new favorite restaurant. I'm in love. I'm from California and it made me feel like I was back home, the food is so perfect. I ordered three corns, six tacos, a burrito, and a side of rice and beans. For my husband, my daughter, and myself. We almost never finish our food, but we ate it all!! When I took my first bite I could not stop saying omg omg omg. Soooo delicious, I'm so happy, I finally found the perfect taco spot. The salsas are all amazing, the prices are great! I will literally never waste my money at Roberto's or Pepe's tacos ever again.
