44TZ46fzjlgZ7_pOqeM4Sg I suspect this may be the best secret taco deal in town. Jutting out oddly from the front of Brulerie aux Quatre Vents in the middle of the interior section of Jean Talon market you'll find a simple family situation. Hot plate for heating up soft taco shells, a slow cooker full of spicy pulled pork, and a few small containers of black beans, pickled onion and veggie options. For $5 you get 3 tacos or one sandwich, and they are spicy, homemade and delicious. There's a bowl of green salsa on a small table by the counter that is a good way to burn your tastebuds off while still experiencing flavour pleasure - a mistake I make again and again, tears running down my face, gasping between grit teeth "it was worth it."
