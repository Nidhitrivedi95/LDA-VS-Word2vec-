LLWOrt8Vo5kyA9qeo-Y76g Authentic Mexican. Kinda like fast food-place your order at the counter but they then bring it to you when done. 4 different salsas on the condiment bar ranging from very mild to quite spicy. I had the two crispy tacos with beef. Not much flavor in the meat but was a good taco. Meal came with rice & beans which are always good! My sister had the two tamales which were the best I had ever tasted! A very nice variety of choices.
