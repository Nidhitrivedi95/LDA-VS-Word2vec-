oOGLDf2rzeCPS7UQ8hhPlQ The fish poke here is epic! I wish they made a larger size because I was definitely craving more when I scraped down the final pieces off the rim of my bowl for lunch today. The flavour combinations here are thoughtfully pieced together with quality ingredients (i.e. dragonfruit and fresh mango) and generous portions of fish (tuna and salmon). They also use a combination of white and purple rice, which really packs a punch. Needless to say, it was bite after bite of deliciousness!

I would've totally given this place 5/5 if it weren't for the price ($12+tx for the poke bowl), but it is definitely worth trying at least once!
