9t8PEynZGVCG1EjOQr1xBA Not many taco places on this side of town other than dominant chains (u know who's). I had a plate w 3 taco choice. I got steak & chicken. Good serving of meat in each taco, they were hot & fresh even at 8pm! Steak was tasty, chicken was seasoned well & not dry - which is not the usual at other places! I even liked the rice (which I usually don't). Friendly service, reasonable prices. Been driving by all the time & saw the good reviews, glad we finally tried it! Doesn't hurt I'm from Chicago so I def tasted home !
