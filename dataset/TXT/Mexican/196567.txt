oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ Went to Chayo last night at the recommendation of a friend and I must say I was very happy with my overall experience.  The food was great and the service was very good.  

The decor of the restaurant is very impressive and you can tell they spent a lot of time and money to every detail.  The restaurant has a great feel and is a fun place to dine.

When we arrived it was very busy but was seated immediately very close to the mechanical bull.  Although the bull was not running (i assume it starts later) you can tell it must be a center point of the restaurant/bar later on in the evening.

Everyone in my party loved the food and the presentation.  At my table people ordered the lobster tacos (recommendation of the server) and everyone loved them.  I ordered the ribeye steak that was cooked perfect and another person ordered the fajitas.  The size of the fajitas was large and he said it was full of flavor and very filling.

Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone that is around the strip that wants to try a unique experience for a mexican restaurant.  With a great location we went and walked through the linq project before heading home.
