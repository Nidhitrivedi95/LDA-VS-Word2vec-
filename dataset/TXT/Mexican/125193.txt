hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg This is a good Mexican restaurant, not great, but good. The chips and salsa are very good, salsa super fresh and tasty! Drinks are good too! I will definitely come back for drinks and appetizers in the bar area.
Dinner was okay. My husband had the ribeye which came with mashed potatoes and asparagus. (He liked it) I just can't bring myself to order steak and mashed potatoes at a Mexican restaurant..... That is what I would order a couple doors down at the steak house in Tivoli Village (which is excellent, by the way)
My dinner was the enchiladas. One chicken and one cheese. The cheese had red sauce and the chicken had a cream poblano sauce. I preferred the cream poblano sauce of the two. The tortilla on the enchiladas had to much of a bite to it, like it wasn't cooked long enough. I prefer a soft tortilla. Just wasn't exactly to my liking. So many Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas make fresh homemade tortillas, I have gotten spoiled.
Beans and rice served with the enchiladas were so so....... beans were good, but rice was undercooked and very disappointing.
