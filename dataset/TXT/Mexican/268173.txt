WlBvw6R1Qe2yIaZp-2ilZA After a wonderful day at red rock canyon my girlfriend and I decided to try out "toros Mexican tavern". As soon as we walked up to the bar I was not greeted and after 10 min the bartender asked me what I wanted! No how are you doing, what would you like to drink or a simple hello. Just a stern look, to me I felt unequal. After my drink I ordered my food with the same nostalgic server. 20 min later my food came, I ordered tacos with rice and beans. Tacos where good but the rice was raw and beans where runny. WTF!!! If you call your selves a Mexican restaurant I would appreciate it if you get the rice and beans right at least since you lack in customer service. Never again coming back here, only reason this place is still open is the location. I rate this place a negative 3 stars.
