B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA Yes yes and more yes! Words can't describe my love for this place. Soho offers a new concept,  sushi burritos. Wrapped in either soy paper or seaweed and filled with fish, veggies, sauces, and your choice of brown or sushi rice the combinations are endless! I always get the soy wrap, brown rice, ahi poke, crab, hanenaro honey sauce, seaweed salad, extra jalapeños, cucumbers, and ginger. Absolutely amazing! If youre a fan if spicy definitely try the honey hanenaro sauce! I highly recommend this place :)
