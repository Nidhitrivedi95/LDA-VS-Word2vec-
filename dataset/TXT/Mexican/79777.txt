CVrySTnC86omXXAm0GJMyA Very very good seafood! After my workout this morning all I wanted was some good fish. Came here with my buddy and got a fish taco, a shrimp taco, and a scallop taco. Was filled off of just two! Scallop and fish were DELICIOUS and I'm taking the shrimp home. And their fish taco sauce is absolutely divine. Salsa is good, needed a little salt. And their cheesecake! Wow, decadent. Will definitely be back here again. Great prices too
