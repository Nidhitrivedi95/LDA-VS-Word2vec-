NF8dnVxSeL2zKKJ2DDkJMQ 5 star for freshness and taste. I like that you are able to spice up your meat how you choose or just leave it as is. All of the veggies are extremely flavorful and the rice was cooked to perfection. Very polite and accommodating staff. Visited three times prior to leaving this review and would recommend over competitors.
