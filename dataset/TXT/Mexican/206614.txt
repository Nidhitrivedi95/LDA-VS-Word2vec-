q1R2R9i3TkH94x-CwP-l4w First off, I really like their food. I always get the shredded beef.  However, I am writing this really because I was to bring attention to how amazing their manager and staff is.  I ordered carryout in July.  When I went to leave, my car battery was dead (which tends to happen with all cars, new and old, in the hot AZ summer). Frustrated and sweaty, I called my roadside assistance and went back inside to wait in the AC. The manager noticed I was frustrated and hot and asked if I was ok. I explained what happened and he immediately got me water and said he had jumpers in his car.  He retrieved his cables and was able to jump my car no problem!  Thank you for your help! Not only good food but good people!
