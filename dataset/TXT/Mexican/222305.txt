RRtjC-KUE9vSbD09r6is2A I've boozed here a few times...but until a co-worker suggested we grab lunch there this afternoon, I never even thought about getting food there.

I'm a fan of their bar.  The margaritas are great.

The food was okay.  Nothing I'd write home about.  But I'd bet that my food would have tasted better if I was feeling buzzed from a marg (the Salty Seniorita is my favorite).

They have lunch specials that are $6.99 and the portions are a bit smaller than the bigger meals.  It takes a lot to fill me up, so the lunch special was a bit smaller than I would have liked...but I left satisfied.
