_ucDskZqK5w1QHkoA_nlRw For Pittsburgh- this is a great taco option. Delicious flavor combinations and weekly specials. However, I've noticed the taco portion size drastically varies based on who's making them. There's been times where they hook it up and give you a good amount of 'fixings', and times where it's mostly a mouth-full of tortilla. More consistency and I'd give it a 5.
