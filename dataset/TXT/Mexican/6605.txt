_H4GXECi4nHfJTz4dsQV_w Recently ate at Rita's for a quick lunch. I had not been here in quite awhile, and decide I wanted a burrito and stopped off here. This is a very clean family owned restaurant where you are getting home made food. You can see them rolling out the tortillas and making everything in front of you. I know the owners of this place (neighbors) and they are nice and very involved with making the food from scratch and working with the customers. Limited seating inside and out side, so take your food to go.
Small amount of items on the menu, but that serves a really good purpose of being able to deliver good quality food. They offer breakfast burrito's and lunch/dinner burrito's. I really like to chile  verde burrito (my favorite). Very reasonable prices for good quality food.
