vBGfITg_FEkFYMQwNagbBA As part of my team's Friday lunch outing, we came here. There were five of us. My manager drove over here from his home after taking a series of conference calls in the morning. I drove my colleagues over to this restaurant.

It's located in a plaza where there are a bunch of eateries. There is also a DriveTest office, which makes me cringe to be entering a parking lot full of worried wannabe licensed drivers.

We went in and were immediately greeted by a number of Chinese folks. It is a cheerful Cantonese-speaking group.

I ordered the chicken bowl, which consists of rice and beans, and any fresh toppings that you desire. Naturally, I needed corn, but also added other goodies. I went with the chipotle sauce. It has a slight kick to it. I also ordered a cream soda.

If you want guacamole, it is an extra $2. The place also sells beer. Seating is limited.

Since were were the largest group there, our meals were brought to us. It was a nice touch.

I enjoyed my chicken bowl. All ingredients were fresh and tasty.

Our group was mixed as far as opinions go. My manager and another colleague weren't impressed. They have been to a number of burrito places and probably have higher expectations than the rest of us. The rest of us found our meals to be tasty.

This place has a card stamp program. If you order ten times, your next order is free. I will need to look at my card more carefully, as I have yet to read the fine print. I will definitely come back here and figure it out.
