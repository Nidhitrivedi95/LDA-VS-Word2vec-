F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw One of the best experiences we've ever had, not just dining experience, but customer experience.  The food blew our minds.  The chips and salsa and guacamole, the carnitas, and scallops were beyond words.  Incredible margaritas.  But the people made it a night we'll never forget.  We sat at the Chef's table and were treated like royalty.  Every person working there made it special.  We'll drive 4 hours to eat here again.
