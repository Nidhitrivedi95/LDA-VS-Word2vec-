pomGBqfbxcqPv14c3XH-ZQ Oh, where do I start...To begin, it took 10 minutes to get drinks and chips. The waitress came to take our order, and was difficult to understand. When we tried to order a dozen tamales, the waitress told us they only had 2 kinds, even though the menu lists 5 varieties. When our order came out all plates were hot, but the food was cold. We sent food back twice and it still came out cold. It took a while to get refills on drinks. The bottom line, not worth the price, terrible service, cold food, and  ignorant employees.
