DMmeFKsUuMl0kDy7Zd7W3A The feel of this place is so very beachy and I love it! Outside some of the tables are actually in the sand and it's pretty fun for everyone! The service is ok and taco Tuesday has become one of the only reasons I come here any more. I don't think I can say much about their drinks because I always seem to be on a little bit of a mission and want to get in and out so I just get water and tacos. Their fish has always been super fresh and the taco combinations are interesting!
