fK1oj0dk9Bc6KsBk5mMDxg Updating my review in light of the menu changing again. Happy to see the pablanos and wet burritos (which are amazing btw) have been out back on the menu. Still missing my ceviche and not a huge fan of the tostadas so review still remains low. Kudos though to the restaurant for listening to their customers and bringing some if their great dishes back. :)
