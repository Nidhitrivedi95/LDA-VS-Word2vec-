95HYvw-Mo6cUR3QN0SjQtA I've eaten here a few times and had mixed feelings about it.

The staff was ridiculously slow to prepare our food the first time we went and they got my order wrong. I paid extra for "mexi fries" with the works on it and they only gave me reguar ones - this is one of my biggest pet peeves seeing as how your PRIMARY job is to prepare my order and do it right. It was okay food, about par with taco bell.

However, I went back recently on a weekend when I was working and not much else was open and got great service. I had their taco chicken salad and was really impressed and I've been back and ordered it again since. First, the salad was huuuuuge. And they put some mixture of onions and tomatoes or something else with yummy mexican spices onto the salad and that made it for me. The taco shell was nicely cooked and the chicken was tender and well spiced. I wouldn't recommend it for anything other than lunch on a workday (not worth going out of your way for) but if you're in the area and you don't want subway, its an okay option.
