sH3UsolKjik01u0HlQ9_0Q I have to say that this was the worst $45 I've ever spent on a restaurant.  

We spent $45 on an iced tea, two cans of Coke, which they advertised as bottles (no refills-I'm comfortable with the no refills, but honestly expected something interesting like Coke made with cane sugar from Mexico at $2 a bottle).  We also had cheese dip, which reminded me of the unfortunate time I made the mistake of buying the microwaveable cheese dip in the grocery store for a quick, easy app.  We had the mixed fajitas which had mushy vegetables, were overcooked and dry and a bit "over-caramelized."  My partner had the shrimp tostadas.  Both were bland and had nothing authentic about them, more importantly they were lacking ingredients advertised, such as sour cream. Just when you thought it was impossible to mess up tortilla chips, there's were burnt, reheated, and stale.

I've traveled throughout Latin America, lived in Spain and Mexico, and along with my Hispanic partner agree that my mother-in-law would never put any of this food on her table. It was just poor, disappointing, and i feel sick at my stomach from this food.

Whether it's been a five-star restaurant or a taco truck, I've had better food elsewhere and I'm greatly disappointed at the value for the price paid. At no point, even after seeing our barely eaten food, did the server ever ask if everything was okay.  

I wish that we had left once the plastic, buttery wax of a bowl of cheese dip arrived...
