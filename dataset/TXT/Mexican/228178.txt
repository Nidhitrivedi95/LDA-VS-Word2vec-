S6BixeT6xkktY3keKSyYrQ Fresh ingredients, nice price, fast service. Chipotles is a great place to grab fresh fast food. I am a total fan of their barbacoa, spicy shredded beef. I chose the Chipotle barbacoa bowl with brown rice, pico de gallo, white cheese, lettuce and black beans. It was a flavorful meal. Next time, I will attempt to demonstrate some restraint and save the other half for a later meal. 

My daughter had the burrito. I wasn't a fan of how thick the wheat tortilla was. The steak was okay. The guacamole was an extra $1.95, but it was a generous portion. 

We enjoyed a large Izze Mandarin drink with our meal. I look forward to coming back and trying the carnitas next.
