dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA I love Phat Phranks! Their food is always delicious and fresh... they even make their guacamole to order!!! Hands down the best chorizo burrito I have ever had in my life, their carne asada is always tender and never chewy, and like I said before their guacamole is always made fresh, as you order it. The restraunt is always clean and neat and the staff were soooo nice the first time I came in and remeber you so quickly, it's like you're instant family. Love this place!
