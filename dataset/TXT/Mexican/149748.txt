jsuUmIEefPjV__ads62Z5w This is a five star restaurant, with 5 star service, and a five star ambience.  My wife and I are here at least once (usually twice) a week.  So, you might wonder, "why only three stars"?  Well, I'm a regular customer- I know the names of the bartenders and the chefs/cooks.  As a result, they know when I walk through the door that I drink Basil Hayden bourbon, and the Chipotle ribs.  So, when I walk in and every other week they are out of Basil Hayden (indicating that I'm not the only one drinking it), that they should be alert to a need to keep the supply stocked.  I don't want to blame bartender for a failure by management to recognize purchasing patterns, but sometimes I have to shoot the messenger; but that hasn't worked.  So, now, I'm posting a three star review, in the hopes it'll motivate an owner or manager to maintain me as a regular costumer by being attentive.  Yes, I could go to the Rokerj or Richardson's and get it...but since they are all the same owner, I'm not going to do it.  So, this is my cry for help before I go to Hillstone, or Linger Linger Lounge, or even The Vig across the street, because I can assure you they won't run out.  Owners, feel free to make it right and my adjusted stars will reflect that you responded.
