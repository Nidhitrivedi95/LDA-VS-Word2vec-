prdA1r8XP03oD-PYvZJ5AA This is my go to spot to eat when I fly out of Phx, AZ. Its located by the gate so its real convenient. According to the other reviews I guess Im the only one who orders the cheeseburger sliders with fries and an Ice tea!
Been here three time and haven't had a bad meal yet. The folks are very nice, you stand in line and they call you when its done. there is limited seating but i've always found a seat. or folks can go out into the seating area and eat as well.
The sliders are cooked just right, not dry with just the right amount of greasiness! The fries are very crispy and not over salted, Plus they don't put pepper on them, don't like pepper on my fries.
Just the right amount of food to make it to Atlanta! the price is a bit high but its an airport restaurant. What do you expect? Anyway I'll be back!
