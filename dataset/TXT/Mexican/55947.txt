a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg If you're visiting from out of town, do yourself a huge favor and dump the strip for a change. Why pay 4x more for shit food and poor service? My wife and I ate here tonight, and the only regret I have is that we didn't find it sooner. For less than $40 we both had a couple of Modelo beers on tap, she had two tacos Al Pastor and a slice of chocolate cake to go; I had 2 carnitas tacos and 1 chicken taco, plus all the chips, queso, and salsa we could shove down our throats. Service was fan-fuckin-tastic, and every bite was amazing. I honestly don't know why this place isn't rated 5 stars. Top quality ingredients made fresh, and tasty.  Try getting anything close to that anywhere on the strip anymore. Good luck!
