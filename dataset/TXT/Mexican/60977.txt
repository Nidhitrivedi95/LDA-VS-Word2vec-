arpBUwgiaE8iqfNGMQ_hgg I just moved to Toronto from the states, where I've had my fill of local joints, Chipotles, Moe's, and Qdobas. I was actually on the way to another restaurant when we passed Big Fat Burrito. I was very excited to try out another burrito joint, so in we went!

The atmosphere is really neat, the guy taking my order was really nice and I got my food quickly. When i got to eating it, the chicken was really overcooked and that kind of ruined the rest of it for me. Plenty of lettuce, though, and I enjoyed the crunch of raw green peppers instead of stir fried peppers, which I'm used to.

Also, for $9 (I was hungry, so I got the large), I feel like I could find a better burrito in this town. I'll probably go again to try a different meat, maybe a different variety of toppings, but the first time definitely wasn't what I was hoping for.
