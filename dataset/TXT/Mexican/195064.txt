Oto60yDwk1z72WmfWEYrjg We had lunch here before leaving, the Guac, salsa and bean dip were great with the tortilla chips that were set out for the table and since there were 5 of us they brought out 2.  I ordered a lunch special fro $10 which was my choice of 2 items served with rice and beans. Didnt realize that this came with a bowl of soup, this soup basically tasted like spaghetti O's except instead of round noodles they were 1 inch short skinny noodles, so if you like spaghetti O's this ok.  I ordered a chicken and a cheese enchilada. The Chicken was quite good but the cheese was not, already congealed and hard. I had also ordered a side of sour cream and like other posters this never happened. our server did not come back and no one else would make I contact as they swirled around the restaurant, they do have a lot of staff which makes you think that the service should be better than it was. All in all i would eat here again and im sure i will next year as my friends love it.
