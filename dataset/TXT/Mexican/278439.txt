XMrLwzmEAsfNpbKRC7vUzQ While the menu looked good, my husband and I couldn't wait to taste any of it because the volume of the tvs was so obnoxiously loud we had to leave. I actually got a headache from sitting in there for 5 mintues. I felt bad making the waitress cancel our order. It doesn't matter what game is on, some people go to your establishment just to eat and enjoy themselves and they can't do that when they can't even hear over the loud tvs.
