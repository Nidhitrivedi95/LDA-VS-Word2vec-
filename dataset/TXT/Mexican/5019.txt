-X_w25LQmz6SDcJIFyAPJw I would give this place less than a star if possible. The cashier with facial piercings was unnecessarily rude making a remark at me not being able to choose a drink size "there's only two sizes". I felt unwelcome and would not recommend this Roberto's especially if you're not a local.
