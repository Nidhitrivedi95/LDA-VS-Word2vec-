h4Q-uSoOIhMoIsOhat6l3A Craving for some Mexican cuisine on this side of town.  We decided to use the Eat 24 app and was surprised that they deliver. Order the 4 Chicken Enchilada plate with lettuce sour cream and green and red salsa mix together. Wet Burrito Asada for the meat very big portion and Very satisfying.  The green salsa has a good kick to it.  They do charge $2.99 for delivery but it's worth it.
