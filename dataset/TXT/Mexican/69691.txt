They chicken was okay not great and then beef was just bad it taste like my Vietnamese beef stew I cook at home. And the bean were surpose to be refried beans. But instead it look like beans from out of a can which is easy for everybody to make. There was no salad. The rice was okay.i also ordered a chilli because it looks so good in their picture , which was horrible.  me and my boyfriend had the same combo and everything came up to $40+. I wouldn't mind if they food was good. But not for me I rather drive further and go to Lindo they are there best and then price is unbelievable fir all these food they give plus they have really fresh salad and Rhys ifans beans. That's what you call true Mexican food.  They open because they enjoy cooking not for profit like this place.
