OA5Li3ySzhrbG_WvD_QGYA Take this place for what it is... The best taco joint around. It's simple, I can't eat there every day but its fun and inexpensive. Just use the taco chit wisely (don't add a ton of things to your taco) The crew who works there is great once you get to know them. Always try the specials, I've never been dissatisfied. Barrio has a great happy hour as well, I must say Wednesday is my favorite where whiskey, bourbon and scotch are all half off until 7pm! Great little place.
