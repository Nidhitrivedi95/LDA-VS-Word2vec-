HOlDxrYqfoJrVq2Eo-_LKQ Went here with my boyfriend not long ago and I was very happy with the barn burner burger. The fried jalapeños were so tasty. My boyfriend got the salad and said it was good, it looks very fresh and it was a large portion. The fried zucchini was surprisingly huge, and although it wasn't my favorite it was prepared well and I only didn't like it because of personal preference. If you download the app you get 5 dollars off your meal which made our two meals only 13$. It was very clean and fast and fresh food.
