FoKx_RP4kUM-aiGo3wlUUw I don't know why people rave about this place? The chips are thick. The salsa is hot without much flavor. The enchilada has that chewy cheese in it that I always hope no child under 4 eats, because they will choke. Beans didn't have much flavor and were lukewarm. This is my 3rd time here and I won't be back. Plus it was warm and there were a few flies...if you want delicious Mexican food, go somewhere else. If you want just ok food eat here.
