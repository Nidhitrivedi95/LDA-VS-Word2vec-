LtilhdZm9gb2dNm6OFHg_w Cheap and yummy.  I'm there probably once a week either w/ co-workers for lunch or with my wife on the weekends.  Salsa is great, but try adding some Tapatio hot sauce to it to make it better.  Lunch #5 is the staple, but the carnitas dinner is great as well, albeit a little hit or miss.  Service is speedy and accomodating.
