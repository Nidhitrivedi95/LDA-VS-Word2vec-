oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ Extremely horrible experience.  Booked a large dinner party for 30 peope, they were given  two days advance notice.  The service we received you would think we just walked in.  Shoved into a very cramped space, no water on the table for over 40 minutes, drinks took even longer.  Food sub-standard.  If you have a large group - avoid at all costs - and even if you are small group - best to just go for happy hour (fuel up on cheap drink) then head somewhere else for dinner.  Food is more "hot" with no flavor.  So very sad to have to write this review - was hoping for a better experience.
