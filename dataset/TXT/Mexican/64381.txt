B1xcP1i6-sZR48zjgpwyfg This is exactly what you'd expect from a college-ish bar on State Street In Madison.  

College-ish meaning it's a good mixture of students and "townies". But still with the loud music.

But I think what impressed me the most about the Tiki Shack was the drink specials.  On a Saturday night I got a double lemonade vodka for $3.  It was pretty much a pint glass filled to the top with vodka and a splash of lemonade.  I'll take it!  16 oz Red Stripes for a good price too, and you'd think you were in Jamaica, mon!
