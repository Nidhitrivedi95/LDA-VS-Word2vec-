IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA Our experience at the Border Grill was fabulous!! From the moment we first walked in, we received great service. We were running late and they still held our reservation. And some of our party was lost and our server, Matt, used my cell phone to give them directions. It was a huge help! Matt was a great server, too! He was very attentive, personable, and made sure that we had everything that we needed at all times. The food and drinks were amazing...especially the blood orange margaritas!! We were there to celebrate our daughter's 21st birthday and the Border Grill made sure to make the night special. The next time we are in Vegas, we will definitely be going back!!
