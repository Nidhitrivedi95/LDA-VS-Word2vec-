Mk7ptSIjvcBPfCLf4PNGWA Food is delicious. Seating is limited, but we have always lucked out and found a seat before our food was finished. I lived in AZ for 9 years - the food here compares to some of my favorite Mexican food in the SW.

I'll hold off on eating here for a while - I noticed too much eating by the kitchen help during my recent visit. A lady actually took a piece of tough meat out of her mouth with her vinyl glove on, and then returned to work! A little too relaxed.

Very good food, I'll check in at a future date...
