qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A I had a great experience at DW Bistro.  The ambiance is cool and inviting.  The patio is a place you can spend a couple of hours and not even notice the time going by.  Once we arrived we were greeted with smiles from the staff and the management was very personable.  A nice wine selection and a simple but flavorful menu made for a great experience.  With a party of six, our server didn't miss a beat.  Her recommendations were on point.  So were the Jamaican Mojito's.  I had the large bowl of Gazpacho which was made perfectly.  I was a cool and tasteful starter.  After that I had the Jerk Chicken Salad.  The dressing was light and the Chicken had a bit of spicy kick.  The only thing i would like to see are more starter options.  We did order the top three starters which were great but if you are like my family, we enjoy ordering tons of apps to try as many flavors as possible instead of individual plates.  Apps and cocktails all around is our preference.  The prices are reasonable.
