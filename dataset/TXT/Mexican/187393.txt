O1ird5yRyuDFnOmYu90OoA I went recently with my sister and it was a rare, mild, non-rainy day so we sat outside.  While we got there around 3 on a Sunday, the place was still pretty packed.

We both got margaritas and they were excellent and a good value at $6.  The chips appeared to be homemade, along with the salsa, which you get complimentary.

I ordered a chicken enchilada and my sister got a chicken chimichanga kind of dish.

My lunch came and it was a v. small skillet with a chicken enchilada in it.  And that was it.  I think it was $11 and the enchilada was v. good, it almost was like a children's portion and no sides.  So that was a disappointment.

My sister's entire dish (she got beans and rice with her dish) was ice cold.  On the bright side, they got everything re-heated for her and she said it was tasty.

If you go, my recommendation would be to pay close attention to what is included with your entree.  While my sister's appetite was sated, I definitely missed some sides w/ mine.

As far as atmosphere, it was a good mix of 20's hipsters and aging baby boomers with my sister and I somewhere in between.  It was a laid back vibe and didn't seem pretentious to me at all.
