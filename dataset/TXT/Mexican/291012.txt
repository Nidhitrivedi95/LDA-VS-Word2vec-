YrqQWT5wzBUumklE4B_XfA Frankly, I am not blown away. The beans they put in my burrito were OH-SO delicious, but I broke out on my cheeks the next day which is a sure sign that it was way too much fat / oil. I don't know what they used to make those delicious beans, but I am not going back to eat there.

The guacamole was mixed with sour cream which gave it a weird taste, and it wasn't just plain, mashed avocados, which is what I was expecting.

The rest of the condiments were fine, but the tortilla wasn't as fresh as the one at Chipotle (sorry, but it's true). I've also had better fresh tortillas out of a package in Texas, the home of Tex-Mex, which puts this place to shame when I just make my own burrito.

I'd rather go to Chipotle to eat a burrito.
