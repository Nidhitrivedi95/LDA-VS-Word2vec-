Oqw-vwoYx-pVIIjOu6KMxA Finally tried this place after such a long time of driving by and should of just kept driving.  Why call yourself mexican food if you do not use any mexican spices.  We ordered two burritos (steak and shredded beef) and they were fine, but thats the problem. No spice, no flavor and tried both of thier hot sauce bottles but they did not help.  Too be honest, their prices are very good, but spend a bit more and eat Filibertos asada with green sauce.
