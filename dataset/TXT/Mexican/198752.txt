P8IsTiHq5Hesa6UPL604ww I've only had the tacos on taco Tuesday ($1 a piece) and I really like them, apparently so does the rest of the world as the line can get out of control. I've tried all of the options and I think the adoboda is by far the best. For only a dollar, they are an amazing deal. I normally get 3 to 4 of them and I'm stuffed so 3 is probably the magic number. Here is my only knock on the place. It isn't fast food, which I know it doesn't claim to be but for an order at the counter type place, they take awhile to get you your food. I've been the only one there and it's taken 25 minutes for a few tacos. If it's packed, you might wait longer. I know this is a DDD spot so naturally you get people wanting to try it but I'm not totally sure it lives up to that long of a wait. I much prefer Carolinas when in the mood for a quick taco or burrito.
