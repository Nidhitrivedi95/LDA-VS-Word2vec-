V80NaT5ZnfuA31yW3Y5Pdg I had these amazing tacos at a few locations around town, but they are currently holding down the fort at 11 N Allen St for a couple months. I tried to keep their tacos at an "occasional treat" frequency, but now that they are so close to work... it's all over. El Grito is inventive and fresh, while paying homage to the tacos they know and love from the Southwest. It's the best of both worlds, and they absolutely nail it.
