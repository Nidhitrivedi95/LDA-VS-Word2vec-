-bMZCfTK7fxFaURynKpBMA I was so excited to try the caldo siete mares at this place! Failed... it was tasteless room temperature water with a few spices and a lot of fish, a couple of shrimp and an oyster. Very disappointing! I was expecting a lot more since this place has good reviews. 

Never again! Learned my lesson.
