-qb_3LLSnBcHA6zc8NRSxQ I came here visiting my grandmother in sun city west, the food was excellent but the service was a pinch slow. It just seemed like a slow day, there weren't many people around. My grandmother ordered a bland dish, because she was scared of the spice and didn't like, however I ordered the enchilada with the tamale and it was excellent and she enjoyed it as well. We also had the fried ice cream and churros. This seems like a good family restaurant with good food, and great desserts!
