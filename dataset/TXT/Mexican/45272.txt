7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA Terrible table management. The girl in the striped shirt seated 2 couples who have been waiting in line for 20 mins while our group has waited for 45 mins, when she could have pushed tables together to fit for a large group. This place isn't great for large groups of 6 or more.

But the food smells amazing. Please teach your staff how to seat your customers.
