iIjVO7cLD1UEmIO7G05Ujw We were looking for a place to eat from our long drive from California. It seemed to be a taco shop in every corner but this place was the only one with customers.  I was very surprised how good the food  was and huge portions. The chips and salsa were great and freshly made. I think our waitress name was Dolores and she was awesome. She took such good care of us and when we come back we will come here first.
