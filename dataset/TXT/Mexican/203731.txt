PQWE8a6Opjiuzt7DaX2R6Q I really enjoyed going to Blue Agave! The Tres Amigos was delicious! Our favorite dish was the $3 nachos off the happy hour menu! It was not only a generous portion but great amount of beef and cheese with guacamole. We also enjoyed the margaritas. Excellent service! The location is of course great because after dinner you can walk over to the movie theater. Can't wait to return.
