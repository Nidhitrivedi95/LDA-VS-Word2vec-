zCmwErM82hdKl4L2UixDJw My husband and I loveeee barrio so we decided to check out the new location. It looks much like the one tremont- skeletons and skeletons on bikes. It was packed and loud!!! Could barely hear myself think it was so loud. Our margaritas were just as awesome as the other location but our tacos just werent as good as the tremont location. I don't know if it's jut along time to perfect everything but it was sort of disappointing and barrio has NEVER disappointed us before. Well give it another shot sometime or stick with the tremont location.
