cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A Such an amazing combination of foods. The Mexican and Asian styles together makes everything taste even more amazing. When you walk inside it's not that fancy but don't let that deter you. The service is quick and they will bring the food to your table. They also have alcohol available. I do wish it was easier to order. Filling out a piece of paper seems out of place compared to other restaurants.

The employees are always helpful. They will fill you in on the menu if you have any questions. If you come for the first time you may have a few.

There is lots of parking in the little strip mall area. You can always park right out front.

I would highly recommend this place to everyone. It's such a unique take on two different cultures Food that just works.
