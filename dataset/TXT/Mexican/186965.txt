O_UC_izJXcAmkm6HlEyGSA I was excited to try this place out. 
Just recently traveling to mexico, I was craving some mexican food in a mexican environment. 
I drove down there with my girlfriend, very cool part of the Annex. Quiet street, pretty cool idea to put a restaurant there. 
We sat down, it was very busy. So far so good. I liked the atmosphere. Even though our waitress didn't speak spanish. Our food came and wow was i disappointed!!! 14$ for our main course and it was 3 small mini tacos........How could they charge that and serve this as a meal......I ate it it, asked for the check and left. We were still not full and still hungry so we had to stop for pizza on the way home.
