EjzMHfwqAmj7BgdzQjquRQ Great service ! great happy hour ....staff went above and beyond . Sopes and salsa were great my life liked the ceviche ...slip the guacamole  ...margaritas were strong . Didn't delve into the main menu but will probably try one day . All in all great value for happy hour ..cool space good vibe
