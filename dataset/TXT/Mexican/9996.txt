_xiUV8OfR6yUJk-09QD6zA This place was even better than I expected! I went to grab lunch here in between classes, and wasn't expecting the long line they had inside. I'm surprised that it has such low ratings on yelp actually.

The staff are beasts! Like well fuelled machines, they were extremely efficient and organized!

I got the regular vege burrito with everything and an iced tea! Absolutely delicious! It totally cost me around 9 dollars i think, and the regular burrito itself was 6.45$ if i remember correctly.

The burrito was filled with beans, rice, lettuce, corn, tomatoes, onions, cheese, cooked mushrooms, grilled eggplant, sour cream, guacamole, spicy salsa type thing, and some sauces that I can't remember as well!

Filling, delicious, and kind of messy at the end (its a burrito after all)

Im totally going back there! If you're vegetarian and have a craving for tex-mex, then look no further!

Bonus is that its on the UofT campus, so its a great place for a quick lunch in between classes
