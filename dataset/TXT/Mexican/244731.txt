TlNOalHa6NUMkWi30iuhNA I visited Hot Heads for the first time today in Cornelius, NC.  There were 3 employees and 1 owner/operator. Everyone was very confused with our whole ordering process.  A few of us had come from our office rather than bringing an order for the whole office to try it out.  We were very disappointed that the amount of chips given was so small... literally like 12 chips in a little bag.   I had asked about getting a large Queso but then they said it didn't come with more chips, so I decided to get the small.  But they rang me for the large by mistake.  So then rather than fixing it - the owner gave me the large.  I said I would take the large but would need more chips, but he said "Chips are totally unrelated to the Queso".  So I said "but what do people do with the queso if they don't have chips with it" and he said people pour it on stuff.  He was VERY rude.  I frequent Salsaritas, Moes and Qdoba regularly but will not be visiting Hot Heads again.
