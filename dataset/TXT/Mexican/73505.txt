Cfry9-vvuseDsbF3Q2H8ew We actually love this restaurant and order all the time! I went this morning to get us breakfast for the first time at 7:15. The door states they open at 7. Doors were locked and lights were off. I even went back up to the door 5 mins later and still nothing. I called around 7:40 to see if they were open and someone answered. When I informed the man that I had come by and the doors were locked he argued with me and said "no, the doors are open". No apology or anything. Extremely disappointed since this is one of our go to Mexican restaurants.
