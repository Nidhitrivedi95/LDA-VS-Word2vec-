zjvnqTjBp56NhMp1GrlO5g It's been a couple weeks since I was there, but I am still disgusted by this place. My pregnant wife and I decided to give them a try on a Thursday evening. We arrive around 6 and where promptly seated next to the bar at a tiny table with several people standing next to us. We asked for a booth but where told by our server that they were reserved- whatever. The waiter came over a few minutes later and took our order. Drinks took about 10 minutes to arrive but the appetizer came out at the same time. About 30 minutes went by and I asked our server where our food was- he looked confused and walked away. I already knew what happened; he gave our food to the table in front of us, who, by the way, didn't say anything when they got some free food. Our server came back and lied, tried to say that the computer broke down and they lost our order- he then offered to make it to go for us. I was beyond insulted- apparently the owner was there, and when I approached him he turned away and continued talking to his friend or regular who just came in. I wasted an hour there and rather than try to make up for it, the server handed my our check, attempting to bill me for the food the "lost" and offered nothing in the way of an apology. I grew up here, and I always tip- not this time and I will not be going to this place again. I plan on letting everyone I know how they treat their customers- pretty sure this S hole will be closed soon. Don't waste your time.
