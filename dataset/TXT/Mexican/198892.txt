P8IsTiHq5Hesa6UPL604ww I came in here with a group of friends the other night after competing in a 24 hour scavenger hunt.  We were all a bit dirty, sweaty, and tired.  But oh so hungry!  We found this place and yelp and expected it to be your traditional mom and pop type mexican cuisine store.  We obviously didn't want to go to any nice sit down place looking the way we did after running around town for 24 hours.  We got into the restaurant and realized how nice it was!  WHOOPS!  But we were also so tired and hungry that we just didn't care at that point.  The motif inside the restaurant is very hip, colorful, and inviting.  They had some sort of hispanic edm type music playing which was definitely a first to my ears!
I ended up ordering the carne asada burrito (minus the beans inside the burrito) and a side a rice and beans.   Also with a horchata to drink,  First I must say the horchata is probably the best I've had in town!  If you're ever in the area, it is a MUST!
I'm normally not a fan of beans, but I've been trying to increase my whole grains recently so I decided to just attempt to eat a small portion.  I ATE THEM ALL!  They were so good and savoury I just couldn't stop.  By the time I got to my burrito and rice I was almost full.  I took one bite of the burrito and was greeted with such amazing flavors of meat!  Top it off with their salsas and you've got one of the best carne asada burriots I've ever had!  I unfortunately had to put it down because I just couldn't eat anymore.  I ended up saving it until the next day, where it tasted just as good!

I cannot wait to come back and try their other menu items :)
