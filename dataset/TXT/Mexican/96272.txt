EjBz4Lx_dg-_gwQQJMzKtA Was hoping for more authentic and this place delivered! They have a somewhat traditional, Americanized menu section but look past that for deliciousness. Tamales, huraches, sopes, street style tacos, all made with fresh masa, on handmade corn tortillas, freshly made guac. So much goodness all made to order
