SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA The food is always really really good. I have become very happy with their fajitas. My office orders for pick up quite often, and every time we order, something gets forgotten. This time it was the tortillas, which kind of ruins the fajita for me. But regardless the food is still great. I would just suggest dining in or triple checking your order if its for pick up.
