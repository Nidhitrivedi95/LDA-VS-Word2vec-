pomGBqfbxcqPv14c3XH-ZQ Dissapointing. We arrived before our friends and saw the C rating health card posted at the counter, but obscured from view behind some free-standing advert plaquards .   We tried to persuade our friends to go elsewhere but they wanted to stay so we did as well.  We ordered elote corn,  a cheese quesedilla and a horchata.  the horchata was too sweet so I traded it for a soda.    The salsas were good but the chips tasted odd. The food took a while to be delivered to the table. The cheese in the quesedilla was too salty.  The elote arrived about five minutes later and was cold.  The service itself was pleasant.  Rating not withstanding, we won't be returning.
