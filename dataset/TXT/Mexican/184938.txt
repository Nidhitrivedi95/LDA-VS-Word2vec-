nt2-Zk4FmGY2SYSDBI0gHw Del taco street tacos are better- my tacos tasted like Chinese food and were so small. Don't waste your time you will be disappointed. Even the meat was hard and tasted old. Not to mention this place is pretty expensive considering the portion size is very small. I have no problem paying more for good tacos, these are just trash.
