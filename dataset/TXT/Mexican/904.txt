-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg Love Joyride! Great atmosphere, great food, great service. This is a fun date-night kind of place or good to go with a small group as well. The fish tacos are delicious, their beet salad is exceptional as well. I wanted to love the tortilla soup but sadly was disappointed with that, but this place is a Taco House, and they do tacos well so that's alright with me! My husband loves their burritos, and their agua frescas are delicious. Get the strawberry one and add Malibu Rum...you won't be disappointed! :) Update: they took all their Ahi Tuna dishes off the menu (appetizers, tacos), which was my favorite thing to order there sometime last year. Haven't been back as frequently and hoping they bring those dishes back! They were awesome!
