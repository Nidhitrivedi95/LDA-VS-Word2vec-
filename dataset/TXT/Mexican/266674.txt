WGkqfp1-3130v8xhCb3APg I went here for the first time on an early Saturday afternoon. This is my ideal place to eat these days. The service staff is minimal. you place an order at the bar and they call your name when your food it up. I don't rate restaurants typically on ambiance or service. My main review is about food. Food is why we go out to eat and it is the reason we come back. First we stated with chips and salsa. The chips were crispy and warmed slightly. The salsa was all fresh cut vegetables and exceptionally fresh cilantro. There were a lot of chips and an equal amount of salsa. This is important because most places pile on the chips and add a scarce amount of dip. 

I ordered a steak burrito with added guacamole. All of the ingredients were fresh and the burrito was grilled so there an added crunch. For some extra flavor there were  home made mild and hot sauces available on the tables. The mild sauce was fantastic and added just the right amount of spice and flavor to my burrito. There are two sizes you can order. I ordered the regular. The next size was larger. I saw someone eating a large and it was huge. The regular was plenty for me.

In the end, the food was fresh and delicious. I enjoyed everything from start to finish and I will be back again. Next time I will be getting the tacos.
