ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA I came here for dinner with a group of five girls while we were on vacation in Vegas per the recommendation of a local, and we were extremely impressed! We showed up on a Friday night with no reservation to find a packed house, but we managed to get seated within a few minutes. The atmosphere's really neat-- cool Latin decor, intimate lighting, and hip music. The staff was super friendly, too. Shout out to Frank! You definitely helped make the night!

We ordered an array of things, but we probably could have been gotten away with just eating the complimentary chips and salsa. My friends all ordered different margaritas, and they were raving about the variety of options and the unique flavors that were offered. The food hit the spot, too, and was a reasonable price. It was nice getting away from the ritzy (new) Vegas strip. If I ever found myself back in Las Vegas, I would definitely go again.
