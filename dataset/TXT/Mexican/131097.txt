iBlQvqiy5Rg2h-y9TS1yOA It is very very rare for me to dislike Mexican food. This place was a disappointment to say the least. In our party of 4, only one person was satisfied with their food. We ordered the queso fundido which sounded delicious but was basically a solid chunk of cheese with no flavor, floating in water. (I didn't know you could take all the flavor out of cheese but this had no flavor at all.) When we asked the waiter if maybe it wasn't heated up all the way or maybe we just weren't understanding how to eat it, he was snobby and stated that it was because they use real cheese. For the first time in years I actually had to send something back and ask for it to be removed from the bill. (Which they did) 
Not one person at the table came close to finishing their meal. We all were just disappointed. My husband who is the nicest guy and gives everyone the benefit of the doubt was first to ask if anyone else felt like the waiter was being condescending. 

Bad service and underwhelming blah food. Think twice about wasting your money here.
