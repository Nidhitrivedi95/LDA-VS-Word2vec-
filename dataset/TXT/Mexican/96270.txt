EjBz4Lx_dg-_gwQQJMzKtA Wow is all I can say. This place is as authentic as it gets. Everything had was phenomenal. It amazes me that people go to huge overpriced under quality spots in south end when the east side has spots like this serving up authentic and extremely affordable plates. If you're at all interested in authenticity visit this place ASAP! You won't be let down.
