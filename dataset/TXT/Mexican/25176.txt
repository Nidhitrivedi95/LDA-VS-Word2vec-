2z7xERz1Nonyw8Kjr4SffA Went here today got 3 carne asada tacos w rice & beans. Not really a fan of the rice or beans but they were edible and I was hungry. The tacos were perfect though! They have a salsa bar & make your tacos plain so you can make them how you want! So all in all I had a great experience! Visiting from Indiana, we don't have taco places like these. I usually have to go to an authentic Mexican restaurant and sit down to eat for GOOD tacos, so the fact that I was able to grab & go just made it that much better!!
