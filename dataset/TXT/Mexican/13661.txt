0odAupWjDV8gwhaLqyh1-A I cant even begin- the app we used said they were open until 10pm. We got there to find they close at 9pm. We got there right at 9 to find the door locked and restaurant full of people. We called to double check and it was in fact the correct place- (we could see them answer the phone and talk with us) the app said they closed at 10pm. I showed them and asked them to honor the fact that the app said 10 and they still had food in the line. They refused and turned us away- we specifically uber'd to that location because of the advertised closing time and I can not believe the TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE we received. Im pretty disappointed and its no surprise they have such a low rating.
