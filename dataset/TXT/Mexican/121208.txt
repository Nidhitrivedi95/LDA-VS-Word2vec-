h4Q-uSoOIhMoIsOhat6l3A I've been to both restaurants for years stop going to downtown one after several times they burn my fried shrimp didn't complete cus I felt more embarrassed me telling the owner Raul which we've known over 9 years so was happy to see him open the summerlin area went there took our daughter she ask  for coffee her cup had lipstick stains on it wasn't wash right then went early one Friday think was the week Raul daughter got married they didn't have caldo not even 11am they were out this I notice happens only when the owner is not there service sucks they are all in the back talking laughing and us customers have to ask the hostess if they are in a meeting cus no one has even come to our table they weren't busy cus it was only us and a couple of other customers just want to give a heads up to the owner that his employees don't work the same when he's away like I say when the cats away the little mice will play and that's not good for the business food is good but its sad that Raul or Maria have to be there in order for employees to stay on top of things
