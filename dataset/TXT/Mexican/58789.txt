aGl6ey1bOn2cqguYMIZyFw Sadly i have to update my review on these tacos 
They used to be for me, the best tacos around in Las Vegas.  But now the person who makes them is someone new and the tacos are no longer good .
I ordered some tripe tacos and they were undercooked and super soggy.  The tongue tacos were hard.  Which means the tongue was undercooked.  It's very sad that they went from being the best to being the worst.  I left them with 2 stars because their other food is ok.


I have only had tacos from here.  This is a restaurant but at night they also sell tacos outside.  I don't know if they do this during the week or only the weekends.  I have always gone on weekends.  This is one of my favorite taco spots in Las Vegas along with Las Taquizas on Lamb and Bonanza. My husband also loves these and he is soo picky with his food.  The meats have soo much flavor and are tender.  They have a condiment section and you can add any of the selections on your tacos.  They have a green salsa that is very good but super spicy.  The first time I had it my nose was soo runny lol.  I hope you guys give this place a try!
