nVHrMUiXqt3bMAia27gRhA Food quality was terrible, the rice looked and tasted old, the carne asada was rubbery and had no flavor at all. The chicken wet burrito that I had was also flavorless it looked like they prepared it days ago and just reheated it in the microwave. The service was great but the food was not good quality and flavorless. First and last visit here.
