vHt0CSynqesXox-9nBj7uA Although I've heard good things about On the Border Mexican Grill but my trip was truly disappointing. The server we had was nice enough, however service was somewhat slow. The ultimate disappointment was the food! I am an avid Mexican food lover so I naturally appalled how that have the food actually was. Honestly the best thing I had were the chips and salsa. My empanadas where lackluster at best!!! They lacked taste and flavor that you expect from Mexican food. Additionally, they were somewhat overcooked. Ultimately my this was so bad I didn't really want to try any of my friends food because I was afraid it might be worse.


Overall I will not return here and I would never ever suggest for anyone to come here. I believe there's so many great Mexican food places available that there's no need to to give On the Border any additional chances. If anybody asks me I would recommend them to almost any other Mexican food place in town!!!
