qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A Happy Hour is not so happy!   We live close by and wanted to go to happy hour.   Called before going and asked if they had happy hour.   We were told yes.    I would not call it happy hour.   They had no food specials, no wine or beer specials.   They had 3 bottles or pre-mixed cocktails grouped at the end of the bar they were "promoting".   It was like they were trying to get rid of the stuff that nobody ordered before it went bad.   The sad thing is, the place was empty.   We were the only 3 people at the bar.   Why not have a few food specials and drink specials and attract the local crowd?   Don't they want to be profitable?
