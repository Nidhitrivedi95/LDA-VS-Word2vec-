j_eGMmT1JvMRh4DK4FrYOQ To start off, the pricing rating on Yelp for this place is wrong. I paid 9$ for a single small size burrito (Large just contains more meat, thats all) and that's not even including guac which is not free btw as other reviews say. 

For another 3$ or 4$ you can get fries and a drink. 

The burrito itself wasn't bad but it also did not stand out. What completes it is the sauces they offer. 

The location itself is decent. No WiFi though but they do have a Dre Beat Pill...yeah that's the sound system. Ohh and there also is a BitCoin machine there...incase you want to buy a 500$ coin while you wait for your 9$ small size burrito

I'm pretty sure they use the same fries as Costco
