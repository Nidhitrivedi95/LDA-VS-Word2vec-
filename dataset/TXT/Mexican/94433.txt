E6DmUAHfSRCEakvknot-zA Great food, but it doesn't fit on the tiny tables!!! What happened to this place?? One of the most important factors when choosing a restaurant is comfort. I'm sad to say that they have shrunk down the booth tables and after getting our drinks and tostada appetizers the table was full. Very uncomfortable.
