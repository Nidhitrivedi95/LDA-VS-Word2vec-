SZpzMUdhh1xu2qlegzSyLg The Good: 

Location, patio and the 'Stiff Slap' cocktail. 

The Bad:

The Service (slow, rude and they don't know their menu)

Cleanliness (the table was sticky, the menu was sticky and if you get lucky enough to sit right beside the kitchen, you'll see that it is FILTHY!)
 
I've only been there for drinks and apps, so I can't comment on the food entirely, but from the apps I've had, they were blah at best.
