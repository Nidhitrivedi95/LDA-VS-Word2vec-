knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw Decent place for Mexican food! Fun selection of tacos to choose from. However our server was not the best, she was extremely frazzled even though it appeared she did my have that many tables and it took a long time for our margaritas and even longer for water and straws. Other tables seem to have better service though. A bit overpriced for the portions.
