manv27dcWwK7reqL-PLDKA I just stopped by at 1:10am and saw the guy in the window, but he didn't take my order.

The hours claim they are opened until 2am

It seems like the employees are selective or like they prefer to act like they aren't working when customers arrive.

Hope the company knows they are losing customers. 

Horrible service!!!!!
