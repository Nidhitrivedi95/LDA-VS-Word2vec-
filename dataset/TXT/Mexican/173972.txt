Flavor of food is standard fare nothing outstanding here it is really overpriced for a place like this, it is packed I bet due to the fact it is the only place you can get tacos around here but don't be fooled into believing the hype it is not good and your wallet will feel it specially if you have a big entourage go some place else you will thank me.
