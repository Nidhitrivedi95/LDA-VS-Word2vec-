YSYDJTCt5kzY2kKnLNGRiA Tired of regular Mexican food...... Go explore Sol Mexican Cocina located in the Scottsdale Quarter. The restaurant is wonderfully warm and inviting with an open concept. In fact, I love to invite my guests to taste "modern Mexican cuisine" which is flavorful and tasty. The quality of food and service have been outstanding each time I was there. If you are fortunate to be helped by Francisco and his team, you will enjoy your meal even more so. They are extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive to your needs and wishes. Oh! Let's not forget the Margaritas! They have a great variety and they are delicious!
