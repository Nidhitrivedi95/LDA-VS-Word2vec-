zCmwErM82hdKl4L2UixDJw I got food from their food truck yesterday at the Fabulous Food event at the IX Center.  The food was not only unappetizing in appearance and awful in taste, but it made me sick.  After waiting in line over 30 minutes,  the three taco -- chicken, pork, and mushroom-veggie -- were all served at room temperature - a health hazard - and the soft shells were all saturated with greasy water.  The pork and chicken were mediocre and tasteless. The veggie taco, after looking at it I didn't even have the appetite to eat it. I picked at it and it tasted awful.  My stomach has been hurting for over 18 hours now, I have made at least 10 trips to the toilet and I can't hold down food.  In summary, one of the worst meals I've had in years and the first case of gastroenteritis (possibly food poisoning) in over 20 years. I'm not going back.
