SAae44V24aD7y_HpgxjhPA I have been here several times in the past 3 years. This place has the best Mexican food I have tasted. Their Salsa and Chips are great. They have amazing Cheese Enchiladas that are very cheesey, melted well and taste very good. The place is very clean I never spot a single spot of dirtiness on the tables. The inside and out are both pretty. The Waiters and Waitresses are nice and well managing. The food comes out quickly and the sides like rice, lettuce & tomatoes are very fresh. The Guacamole and Sour Cream they have is the most fresh I have had. Every Serving I have had there I have never had a concern, ever. I have never had there Dessert but I am ready to try it soon. Looking for the best Mexican food in the valley? you've found the right review.
