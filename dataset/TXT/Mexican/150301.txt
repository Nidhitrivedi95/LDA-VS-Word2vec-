Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ Happy Hour was such a steal! Our server was awesome and told us about the HH and we ordered so many drinks because it was so cheap! The food was delicious and the margaritas were so good! Definitely got me tipsy on a good one.

The area was generally pretty clean..a little sticky, but nothing too crazy. It's right along the busy parts of the strip so it was perfect to stop right in for some cold drinks!
