0bqV9uzFVz98Bn_RImcJTg This is a great location (and one of the only ones I've been able to find in Vegas). The staff is always friendly and it's never been super busy when I've visited--been about 10 times total, some lunch and some dinner. I love that you get free queso--something no other burrito place seems to want to do. Also, they don't advertise it but they have free wifi. So if you work from home like me and you're tired of having to go to a coffee shop every time you want to co-work, you can do a working lunch/dinner here. It's nice and quiet (and delicious).

TIP- If you're like me and get things like the Double Decker Taco or Cheesy Gordita Crunch from Taco Bell because they have that softness with a crunch, next time you get a burrito from Qdoba ask them to add tortilla strips. It's the perfect add-on for crunchaholics like us ;)
