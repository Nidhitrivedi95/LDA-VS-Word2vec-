XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg I love Bobby Flay, so I was super excited to eat at his restaurant. My husband ordered the tiger shrimp tamale with blue corn for an appetizer and it was fabulous! I had the green chile burger with southwest fries. It was just as tasty as I imagined it would be. My husband ordered the pork tenderloin sandwich and it was so good! The sauce they put on it is spicy and perfect! We loved it so much, we went back two days later. The ahi nachos and salmon are also delicious! We loved everything we tried!
