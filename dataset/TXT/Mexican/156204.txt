kbTAyySlUZrTAr0nJOjiUw This place has declined in qualitry in the last few years.  Not to mentions how RIDICULOUS their prices have gotten!!!!  WOW.  There are so many mexican restaurants in Las Vegas/Henderson that it is just inexcusable to have bland and overpriced food.  We had a taco salad, carnitas that had no flavor at all, a beef burrito and a quesadilla that all of us shrugged at.  Frankly, Super Mex right down the street is much better.
