pEH8XwiyGOe1t7GlboAgGw The food was excellent! My hubby and I ordered the grilled shrimp, lamb tamale, and the octopus to start. The tamale was out of this world!!! All were delicious. We ordered the fish and the pork belly for mains- both really good. The Pinot noir we chose was delicious, as were the cocktails.

The service was slow at first. They were overwhelmed with the people that kept coming in- you could tell they were understaffed. The bottle of wine we ordered didn't arrive until after our appetizers were brought out, so that was frustrating however, the waiter DID bring us each a half glass of cava on the house in celebration of our anniversary- so that was nice. There were a few fruit flies when the wine came out. As annoying as they are, we have a few in our kitchen in the summer months, so I know they're hard to get rid of and not a sign of a dirty kitchen, so I overlooked them. In general, I really liked the decor, ambience, and set up. Great lighting, pretty colours on the walls, white linens, candles, a comfy booth seat, and a somewhat open kitchen.

All in all, we had a great anniversary dinner and thought the food was delicious!
