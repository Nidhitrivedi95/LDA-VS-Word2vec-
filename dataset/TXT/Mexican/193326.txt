OOHlm2lbVgPHhSe98YW3yA I've ate here twice. I was not impressed the first time but figured it deserved a second chance. Disappointed again. There's no flavor! The chicken and pork are bland and the carne asada tastes of cinnamon. The rice is moist but again, no flavor. I'm really baffled by this. Plus, it is pricey. I will not be going a third time. The two stars are for atmosphere, and the nice staff.
