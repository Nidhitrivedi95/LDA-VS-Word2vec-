lJvcWyi6_vGWVavWkMrbVw I am a Mexican food fanatic, and have tried dozens of Mexican restaurants in the Charlotte area. Other places are good, but Don Pedro is FANTASTIC! 

I could literally drink salsa, and their salsas are no exception. From their mild, to hot, to their salsa verde...they are all fresh and delicious. Their tortilla chips are a little thicker than others you'd get at a Mexican restaurant, and every time I've been there, they have been served warm. What's not to love?

The one thing I really like about Don Pedro is that you get a ton of food for your money. Portion sizes are huge! This place is super generous, and I love that my dollar goes farther here.

Finally, at the end of your meal you're given warm sopapillas with whipped cream, and some other type of magic drizzled on it. Those things are addictive, and one part of my meal I always look forward to!

I have no complaints about Don Pedro! Stellar food!
