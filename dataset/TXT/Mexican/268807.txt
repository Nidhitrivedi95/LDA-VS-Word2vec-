wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ I've been working in Cleveland the past few months and wanted to get out of downtown and explore the other dining options in this city. I noticed on Yelp Mi Pueblo had received good reviews for their authenticity and yes, I agree with the other reviewers about the food. It's nothing too spectacular, it is just authentic Mexican food. The prices were decent and the decor was as everyone else has described it. 
But what I didn't expect was to contract viral gastroenteritis from this place and remain sick for several days. If you don't know what this is, look it up. It sucks. I will be working diligently to have this place inspected by the city health department for unsanitary conditions. I will never go there again. Good luck if you feel like taking your chances at this shady joint.
