GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog Don't come expecting authentic.  

No MSG and not oily.  The har gow and siu mai were amongst the cleanest I have ever tasted.  Not sure where the shrimp was in the har gow, but it was flavorful from shitakes.  

Duck potstickers were not what I expected with strong cumin flavors, but quite good and artistic with the 'lace'.    

Didn't love the tea.  Don't trust the 'Perfect Tea Timer'.  The green tea was weak.  

Requested for spiciest level of guac, barely any heat, but nice addition of queso fresco and corn tortillas were soft and fragrant.  All three tacos ordered were well seasoned and brimming with meat.  

Customers matter here, I sent the spring rolls back, because the menu did not indicate it was a fried version.  

Large variety on the menu.  I left wanting more and hoping there was time to return.
