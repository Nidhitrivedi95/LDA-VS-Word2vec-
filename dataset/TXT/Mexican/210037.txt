qL9CBB9lwY0ftdUcqVMUgw Stopped in here today to get some lunch.

It's a small spot next to a noodle joint and a tattoo shop. 
The TV was blasting Judge Mathis when we walked in.
We ordered a fish taco combo, that comes with rice and beans.
Two small carnitas tacos, and a carnitas torta.

We got salsas, limes, and carrots before our food was delivered to us.
They have a vinegar salsa that was to die for!
Tacos were good, but I guess I'm used to the creamy sauce that comes with it...these fish tacos could have really used it. The small tacos were good, The torta was a tad salty for my liking.

The carrots were just mush. Usually, I'm used to them raw, with a little bit of crunch.These tasted like they were boiled before they were pickled. Not very appetizing.
