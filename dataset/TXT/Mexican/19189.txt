1Vvxx-9AoINg8TJXOZgEHg This was the only place I ate at, over a week in Vegas, that I'd give less than 3 stars.

First off, it's way - way overpriced. I saw some people mentioned happy hours and we missed that, I'm speaking in terms of the general dinner. We paid something like $150-200 for 4 people to eat and get drinks.

Being from Texas, my mark for Mexican food is high. We ate at Cabo Wabo too, it was a little better and a little cheaper. The food here was very plain. The chicken was just a simple white meat in rectangular strips and the tortillas were standard, not homemade. There are also no free chips and salsa (which blows my mind at a Mexican food place).

The big knock is that the queso is barely a step above the jarred stuff in the stores. There is an oil based, cream quality to it. It's just plainly subpar. 

The place was clean, our server was nice and everything like that went well. But the food to price ratio (however you want to put that) was just way off.
