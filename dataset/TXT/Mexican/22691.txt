2j78b8m1w4Sr2GVGCzFBtQ Taco Tuesday drew me in to finally check this place out.  In order to get the $2 taco special on Tuesday, you must dine in, really?  I ended up eating in and you must get the chicken, pork, or shredded beef for $2, which I did, but the shredded beef comes with a strange cheese which I asked not to have.  The chips and salsa hit the table first and it was pretty good, though the salsa was a little different.  The tacos came out soon after and were decent, nothing special.  I would say that the flavor of pork was a little better than the others, but again nothing special.
