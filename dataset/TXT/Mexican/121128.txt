h4Q-uSoOIhMoIsOhat6l3A I love this place. I have admittedly only had a few dishes, but all have been good. I have eaten the beef tacos and guac a few times and it has been awesome every time. The seasoning in the beef is delicious. 

The atmosphere and liveliness of the servers adds to the experience. Every time I have eaten, the servers have been very personable. 

Great location and great addition to the west side of Vegas.
