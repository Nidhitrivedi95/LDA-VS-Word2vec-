3u5el8pjsc6igwPlls0_6Q I love the tacos here, they are simple and delicious. It smells so good when you get close, like when someone is barbecuing next door. They use real mesquite charcoal it smells so good and gives the food that great flavor. I add grilled onions they are sweet and cooked perfectly. Don't forget your Mexican coke!!
