QC9bLPcNk6ymAOHf03pHhQ Is it bad that the only reason I come to dell taco is because they have really good chili cheese fries?! I couldn't tell you a thing about the burritos! But what I will say is that the fries are so amazing and also they have this deep fried cheesecake type of desert! Yum! It will cost you about a million and a half of calories per bite but very worth it! The drive-thru at this location is always insane! If it's late night on the weekends then forget about it! Just this past weekend I was in line for over 20 minutes no exaggeration! It's a good thing I had nowhere to be seriously! The little boy that runs the order taking is a trooper because I could hear how he was getting cussed at from the drivers in front of me! I didn't even want to go there with him I took my fries and went about my business.
