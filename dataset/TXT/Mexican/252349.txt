uRNQ4z2QQPX7tqWpMjiuTw What happened to Emiliano's? I had never been to this one before but the food quality was not the same and neither were the portions. The supreme enchiladas used to be 5 enchiladas, now it's 4. I'm not a fatty, but it's my favorite dish. Very disappointed. Service was beyond slow for a sat night that wasn't too busy! We won't be back.
