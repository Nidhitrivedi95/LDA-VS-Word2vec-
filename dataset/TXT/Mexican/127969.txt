HwV2hQr7fbpiG8wODWJQ1w Azteca is tucked behind a hotel in a strip of other restaurants and shops. Parking is a breeze and there is a lot of indoor seating. 

They have complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa has a slight kick so sensitive tongues be careful! I ordered a margarita... it was nice and strong. Such a shame that they don't offer specials.


I ordered a chicken quesadilla and the bae ordered a chicken burrito. The food came out quickly and was delicious. It wasn't the best I've had, but it was pretty good. I didn't care for the sour cream that much but it didn't ruin my meal. 

Service was good and I had no complaints. Overall, this place is pretty solid, especially for the area.
