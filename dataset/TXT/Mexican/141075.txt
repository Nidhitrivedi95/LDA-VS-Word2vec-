Ja4stXdNYr39u5CZHMNtjw I don't know why you would go here.  Barrio Queen is super close and much better food.
Help was nice.  Cheese crisp was tasty, as was salsa/chips.  Guacamole tasted like it was out of a salt-can.  Queso had lumps of cheese in it, not even melted.  Taco's were terrible - who puts cheddar cheese on taco's?  Really dry meats, not much of it on there.  Just a few frozen shrimp laying on a bed of dry rice?  Seriously?  The chicken tortilla soup tasted like chili. 

It was a rough meal.  So, I guess if you just want a cheese crisp, come here.  I wouldn't touch anything else.
