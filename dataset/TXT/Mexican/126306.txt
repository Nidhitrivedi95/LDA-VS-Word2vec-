HUKbH7r9TBJPri6LJbBKtw It was OK. The bathroom was messy, the food was skimpy and prices are unnecessarily high. The quesedilla was 7 bucks and barely had meat and was extra greasy. Street tacos were $2 but they were OK.  Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. It's not worth anything to stop and eat here.
