Gq3OgSd5KflKuwNJmuWt7Q My sister and I were in town for the Packers-Cardinals game.  We found this place looking for a place to have breakfast.  I can't comment on the food because they had a limited menu on game day and we didn't like any of the options.  The only reason I'm even writing a review (this is the first Yelp review I've ever written) is because I wanted to commend the service we received from the bartender, Isabel.  She deserves 5+ stars.  She was very, very friendly and made us feel as if this was our local bar. She felt really bad about the menu options (as if it was her fault).  She makes a great drink.  If I'm ever back in Glendale, I would stop in just to see her.
