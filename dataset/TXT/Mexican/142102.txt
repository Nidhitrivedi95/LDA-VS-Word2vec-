jD7tkMdKp5lwGSuHSChx_w I'm torn!! So this place is always super packed during 'rush hour', but they are fast at getting you through the line. Half the staff are nice and personable, and some are just... weird lol. I've seen one guy sneeze down and away from the food that's laid out, but seriously?? That's disgusting!!! He didn't cover his mouth and I think we all know that when you sneeze it travels. Omg I don't even want to talk about it. Then recently I found a leaf in my bowl! LOL. Like seriously! Not a lettuce leaf or a spinach leaf or a cabbage leaf, like a fuggin LEAF leaf. From outside! From a tree! From like the great outdoors! Haha. I chopped it up as them living up to their organic, fresh ingredients and got over it. My only other concern is that the food is all laid out, but they don't wear hair nets (just hats), or long sleeves (I think) or yada. Which I don't know about you, but totally grosses me out! So it's covered from customers? But not from the staff? Like hairs can fly off of your body or things out of your nose or whatever and if you think about it, it's seriously not sanitary! The food should be covered on both sides of the spectrum!

BUT the food, IS just so soo gooood though! Ugh!! 

So I don't know you may have a -weird- experience, and if you can get over the sanitary issues (lol) then go for it! It's seriously yummy.
