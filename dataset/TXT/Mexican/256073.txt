VFv7NcPW9ajUTLleJ8wOQA When I was working in Oakland I would eat here about 3 days a week.  I'm a very picky eater and ate at this restaurant easily 100+ times and only a few times was I disappointed.

I eat out often and it's hard to find that kind of consistency in restaurants today!

This Chipotle in Oakland is also the best on I've been to. It seems they pay more attention to quality there than some others I've been to.  

Although I no longer work in Oakland I will drive out of the way to go to the Chipotle in Oakland when I get the craving. I was pass up other Chipotles to get to this one!
