wJ84TZZTuT0EdLzPHt8RDw If I could give none I would, despite the reviews I wanted to give this location a try....disappointing for sure!!! 

Restaurant was too cold that it made our food cold, service was beyond slow, waitress seemed overwhelmed or confused when asking her about drinks. The waitress comped my food bc I didn't like it and wouldn't eat it so that was a plus. 

The guy bussing all tables moved faster than any waiter or waitress in sight, when we finally had enough and asked the waitress for the check she replied with give me a few minutes. What?! For my check to pay....unbelievable.
