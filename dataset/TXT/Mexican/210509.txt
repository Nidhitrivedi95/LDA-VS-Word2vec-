Jack N nailed it right on the head. He literally said everything that I had planned to write down for my review. 
Like I always say you can always tell the quality of a Mexican food restaurant by the salsa, beans, and rice. What's the first thing they bring out? The traditional salsa and chips. The chips not bad. The salsa TERRIBLE! I should've known with the name Blanco that it was going to be super mild and bland. Seriously the worst salsa I've ever tasted. We tried to add pepper to give it a kick, but no. I even asked for a spicier option and the only other option was their roasted mango salsa, which was about as spicy as the other with our addition of pepper. Ok so it had a kick but not enough to kick it over the satisfactory scale for us. I've had better salsa's from a jar at frys. 

We did actually have food and drinks. We ordered the nachos and a couple tacos.
The beer was good, the Machaca and Chicken tacos were surprisingly good. The nachos, just like the salsa, lacked flavor spice and ingredients. 

Given that it's Snottsdale I'm really not all surprised that they're still in business given their competitive Happy Hour prices in this area, even tho they fear the jalapeño.

So if you're a person who wants to play the Scottsdale uppity role, that can't handle the spice, just looking for some place to drink beer and snack on some decent street sized tacos this place is for you.
