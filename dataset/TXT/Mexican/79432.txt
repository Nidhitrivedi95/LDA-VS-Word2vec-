cUFBO-5Fgd7pR0JUakWXSw We tried this restaurant in old town Scottsdale last year and this is the new Kierland location. It is big, spacious and has a second floor.
The menu is same as old town location and staff are very friendly and helpful, especially Jeff, our movie star looking server. The decor is nice and has a huge bar on the main level. Individual washrooms are clean and nice.
The chips and salsa are good and have a chipotle flavour. Hubby got some ghost pepper sauce. The table side guacamole was delicious.
Hubby had the creek side filet which he rated 5/5 and said it melted in his mouth. It came with poblano grits. My son had the grouper with a crab/banana croquette and crunchy quinoa....he rated it 4.5/5. I had the squash and black bean taco without cheese. I did not enjoy it at all. The texture was hard and seemed not fully cooked.
For dessert hubby had the chocolate mousse pastille, which was good but both he and my son agreed the pumpkin bread pudding was excellent.
The bill was $160 before tip for 3 of us to eat, with 2 margaritas.
