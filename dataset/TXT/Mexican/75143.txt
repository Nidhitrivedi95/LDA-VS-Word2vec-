This restaurant was featured on Diners, Dives and Drive-ins. Chino Bandido is the very definition of dive.  

Service:
Pleasant and fast. Some staffs were friendlier than the other. Unfortunately for us, we got the other.

Food:
Because of all the food trucks in LA and OC, I knew that Mexican and Asian combo is a winner. While the dishes I've tried in Socal are Mexican and Asian cuisines fused together to create a dish, at Chino Bandido, Mexican and Asian dishes are separate but are served together. 

After sampling several items, I decided to get Jerk Fried Rice bowl with Jade Red Chicken. Jade Red Chicken was quite similar to but definitely more flavorful than Orange Chicken. Jerk Fried Rice on the other hand, is basically a Chinese-style fried rice with small cubes of jerk chicken. The smokiness and spiciness from jerk chicken went really well the sweeter Jade Red Chicken. 

Cost Performance:
The cost was under $7 excluding tip. Considering the serving portion (while not generous, it was more than enough for a person with average appetite) and the quality of the food, the cost performance is pretty good.
