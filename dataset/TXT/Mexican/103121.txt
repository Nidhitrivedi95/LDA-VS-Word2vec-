F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw Could have been better...service kinda lacked, it's too bad for such a notable establishment.   The food was too salty along with the staff.  I expect a friendlier service, but no.  This is not the first time I've been here, but it is the first time I've had terrible service.  Rude, and absolutely non personable.  I had a finger held up to me, almost like shushing...excuse me?  It was my mother's birthday and they don't even offer a complimentary dessert, interesting....not really expecting a free ride, but if you have costumers that are loyal I would imagine you would take care of them on occasion.  Tell your staff to loosen up, it's not that serious.
