xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw I love chewy flatbread and I love fried foods, so I knew I had to try fry bread while in Arizona. We decided to check out The Fry Bread House on a Saturday night before we headed to the Rockets game. There were people in the restaurant at 6pm, but we were able to order right away. We got:

-Ultimate Taco (Refried Beans w/Spicy Red Chili Beef, Diced Onions, Sour Cream, Shredded Cheese, Lettuce, $7.69, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-fry-bread-house-phoenix?select=w9ARHJ3G0GpgcvKd2eyGFA#w9ARHJ3G0GpgcvKd2eyGFA): Yum (I stole a bite of my friend's fry bread)! I really liked the spice in the red chili beef, and that the beef was really tender. The fry bread was perfectly cooked, and was crispy but still chewy.
-Ultimate Taco (Refried Beans w/Green Chili Beef, Diced Onions, Sour Cream, Shredded Cheese, Lettuce, $7.69, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-fry-bread-house-phoenix?select=w9ARHJ3G0GpgcvKd2eyGFA#IGaxrR-YU3PsJ6IYjvRHnw): We got the refried beans on the side, and I was really happy we did that since the fry bread itself was really filling. I loved how puffy it was, and the green chili beef had really good flavor. 
-Chocolate & Butter ($4.95, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-fry-bread-house-phoenix?select=w9ARHJ3G0GpgcvKd2eyGFA#IDu9jkqjvrKF6MlGhZKojA): SOOOO good- a must order if you enjoy sweets/dessert! This fry bread could have used a bit more chocolate, but I loved the combination of the chocolate and butter. 

I really wish they let you do half and half of the red chili and green chili beef. I knew I wouldn't be able to eat an entire fry bread to myself since I also wanted to try a sweet one, so I had to make a decision to choose either the red or the green. I wouldn't mind paying an extra $0.50 or $1 to add the extra flavor, just because I know I won't get to come back for a while. I liked both the red and green chilis, but would probably choose the red over the green just because I like spicy food. I was super full after eating half the ultimate taco and 1/4 of the sweet fry bread; however, two of my friends were able to eat the entire ultimate taco on their own and eat some of the sweet fry bread. The restaurant itself is very hole in the wall-ish, and the building is definitely on the older side. The benches for the tables could have used some cleaning, and the lady taking our order could have been a little friendly, but oh well, have low expectations for that sort of thing when you dine here. Just come for the delicious, fatty, fry bread, and your tummy (and wallet) will be happy! Parking was easy in their lot, but I'm not sure where you would park if the lot was full.
