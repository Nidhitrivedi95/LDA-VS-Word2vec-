XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg I had a lot of fun here with my friends. 

60% of the table ordered the pork tenderloin, which was, indeed, fantastic. It fell right apart in my mouth. I've described a lot of pork as "dry and chewy" but this was the exact opposite. I ordered the duck breast and it was everything I wanted it to be and more. I rarely order duck but the side was a chorizo and goat cheese tamale (!) was too enticing to pass up; it's too bad that was a bit too dry, but the breast made up for it. My other friend ordered the coffee crusted filet mignon, which was super tasty. The pork portion was huge, but the duck was pretty small. So, that was a tad disappointing. The desserts were pretty good (banana cream pie & apple pie), but nothing out of this world at all.

Beware, some of the food is very spicy (duh), which I love but some people could grow tired of the tastebud assault. 

The drinks are ridiculously tasty and strong, though a bit overpriced. The cactus pear margarita was striking and tasted even better. 

Even Bobby Flay haters won't be disappointed, trust me.
