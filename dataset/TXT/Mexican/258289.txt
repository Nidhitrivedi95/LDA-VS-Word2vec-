VjjUTy8dkHAW2-YrMQDg9w I appreciate a good fish taco and they have em! Shrimp Cocktails Are extremely flavorful, and you can't leave without trying some homemade beans! We come here often and I'm never let down!

The Spanish music sets the vibe and just gets you ready to have some great food with family and friends. Also if your in the mood to have a few, get a bucket of coronitas!
