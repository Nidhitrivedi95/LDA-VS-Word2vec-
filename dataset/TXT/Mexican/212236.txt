qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A Over priced, small portions. It is tasty, but we got the shortrib smothered sweet potatoes, and half of the meet was a blob of fat.. Service was ok , the guy kept looking out the window..(it was raining).. when he was talking to us, taking our order... This establishment just not for me, but I heard brunch is better...
