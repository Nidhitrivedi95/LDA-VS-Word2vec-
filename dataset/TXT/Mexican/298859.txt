zJGtD3y-pAIGNId4codEEg RAT!!! Loved this place, it "was" one our favorites. But... while we were waiting for a table last night a rat fell onto their wood pile from the wall or ceiling. It was attached to something like a trap and screaming with pain, so they clearly know they have a rat problem. We were two feet away from it. Needless to say, we didn't stay to eat. Hopefully they get this under control as we really liked the place. Happened on 09-08-2017 at 6:30 pm
