y3RlbCN0UrDdLnjSF9NkXA Came here for some family dinner but I'm unsure if the occasion. They had just reopened after their remodel. I had the chicken fajita skillet. It was good and you could tell fresh. Their complimentary chips and salsa were also a hit. I just moved closer so I imagine my fiance and I will probably be back.
