ja5iZ6fNI8oc83DTgaQ7lg I found this place when Yelp said there was a 'hot new place' nearby. I usually ignore these alerts but I'm so glad I followed up on this. It was easy to find,  I went to the Peoria location. Juan is such a nice guy.  He acknowledged each customer who walked up and chatted up everyone. I went on Taco Tuesday so there was a special of 4 for $5. Winner.
I'm not a picky eater so I ordered my carne asada with everything. Juan was very easy to talk to and worked quickly, he wanted me to try to a chicken taco so that was an extra treat! 
The tacos were loaded with toppings and immediately filled my car with a delicious scent,  I couldn't get home fast enough.
I don't know what sauces he puts on the tacos but everything works. 
It's not crazy hot, it really is a perfect mix and balance.
Whenever I get a chance,  Ill go back and will definitely spread the word about these street tacos. 
Recommended.
