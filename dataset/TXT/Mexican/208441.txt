QDRFdG8gPPKL7r4yic8j7Q My review is entirely based upon the breakfast burros.  I haven't tried anything else here yet, but the word on the street is just stick to the breakfast burritos and go to Los Taquitos down the street for your other meals.

Meal:  I always try a new breakfast item when I am here but I think I have cycled through all of them already.  Don't judge me too harshly, this place is right on my way to work!

Taste:  I believe it is a well known scientific principal that no breakfast taco can taste bad.  But that isn't to say that all breakfast burritos are created equally!  The OBC's burros are magnificent creations that make all things in the world right.  10 out of 10.

Value:  The burritos are slightly bigger than what your would expect for the price.  Any bigger, they would be impossible to consume without a knife and fork.  And honestly, who eats burritos with knives and forks?  5 out of 5.

Service/Cleanliness:  Maybe I don't put a big enough smile on my face when I walk in but the person who takes my orders always seems to be in a rotten mood.  Sometimes it takes a long time to get my burro and I have lost tracked on how many times people who put their order after me and got theirs before mine came out.  If it happens one or twice, I understand, but almost all the time?  Come on, man!  6 out of 10.

Atmosphere:  Nothing special, that's for sure.  There is really no way to comment on their atmosphere when there really is no atmosphere.  1 out of 5.

Overall:  If you stick to the breakfast burritos, you will be safe.  Going outside of the safe will only lead to a broken heart.  22 out of 30 points, 4 out of 5 stars.
