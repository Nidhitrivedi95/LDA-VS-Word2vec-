SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA This is by far the best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. I had been looking for years to find a great Mexican restaurant. Finally the quest was over when I ate her. 
The chicken nopalitos is amazing. My favorite! Anything I have had there is outstanding. Hand made corn and flower tortillas. 
The wait staff is friendly and courteous. Always a great experience!
