joTw5858fDh3Y_rF0NDOsg Cheese-aloo!! I came here with a coworker for lunch one Monday. I had the chicken enchiladas and albeit it was very tasty it was soooo cheesy! So were my coworkers tacos. We had a small plate just full of all the cheese we didn't want to eat haha. I love cheese, but wowza. 

We also had to have a margarita since they were only $3.50! Yumm. Can't beat that. 

There was no wait, which was nice and the place was clean. I had an enjoyable experience and wouldn't definitely dine there again :)
