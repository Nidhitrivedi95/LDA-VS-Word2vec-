0jAexNHRHhkQv4zNYqenBA The experience I had here was absolutely horrific! We went to this bar because it was on the list for our 90's bar crawl we were attending. I have been to this bar in the past and it was always super packed so this time I was excited since the traffic was slower. Upon arriving we attempted to get drinks at the bar. I've been to bars in the past to know that there is always going to be a bit of a wait when ordering drinks but something was off about the wait time we experienced. A person from our group tried to get the bartenders attention, he made eye contact with him and the bartender went straight to the person to our right to get their order. We figured maybe he just didn't see us so we kept waiting and listening to music. As soon as he was finished he walked the end of the bar and as he was on his way back to our side, he made eye contact with us again but went to the group that was to our left that just had walked up and began to took their order. Now I know he was choosing to ignore us because we had yellow helmets on and bowls attached to our heads with green slime (for our 90's costume) so it would be pretty difficult not to see us in a crowd let alone a bar. We had been waiting so long and were so shocked that we were being ignored that we ended up asking that same group to order our drinks for us. When he came back with the bill and grabbed it and thanked him for finally making our drinks. The more we stood there the more I paid attention to the fact that it wasn't just that we were apart of the 90's crawl but perhaps a race issue as I noticed that a group of really pretty Hispanic girls near by trying to order drinks were receiving the same type of service as we were. It was so bad that another person not soon after asked if we wanted them to order our drinks so we could get service quicker.The bartenders name was Mike B. and the way he treated us and I can only imagine others is unacceptable and needs to be dealt with.
