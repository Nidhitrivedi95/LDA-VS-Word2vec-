iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg I always drop by Seven Lives whenever  I visit Kensington Market.  This is the to-go to place in Kensington for food. 

The tacos are so good and full of flavour! They are reasonably priced because they are actually really filling! The ingredients are always fresh and tasteful.

It's always so busy here and there's always a line of people waiting. The place is a little too small with limited seats however. The tacos are definitely worth the wait though!
