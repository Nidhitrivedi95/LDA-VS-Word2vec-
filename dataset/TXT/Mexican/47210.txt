7vHLAKprTTKDr7qmqCX7ZA Great local rather loco spot. Great service, Food has never been bad, and the margaritas are good for the price. I suggest a pitcher if you are with 3 or more people. Food wise the enchiladas are killer, fajitas no matter what kind are very good and the Pollo Con Crema is perfect.
