8iVd6gMWKGGU9SL55B4vjg Amazing food everytime! I've tried all over the area and this is by far the best Mexican. I've been going since they started out on route 980. Los Chiludos! AKA the tomato by the way. Oh also the friendly service is awesome everytime. There hasn't been a disappointment yet and I've gone and tried many things. Chicken and steak fajitas are best! Also the size of the meals are great! Always have leftovers and I eat alot!
