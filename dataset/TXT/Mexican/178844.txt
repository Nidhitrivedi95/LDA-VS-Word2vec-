MyTsAeShB9pcWP84GSTAdw This place is absolutely awesome. While the service was a little slow, I'll cut them a lot of slack on that because:

- there was a group of like 30 people that had started arriving a few minutes before us and was still arriving after we were seated

- the waitress was really nice, and very attentive when not dealing with said large group

- service was only a little slow despite staff being clearly overwhelmed

- food arrived promptly and hadn't been sitting under a heat lamp

So, beyond that, the food was absolutely delicious. I had the Daeji bulgogi burrito (pork fusion burrito). My friend had the fusion tostada (pork) and an order of wings. Neither of us was able to finish what we ordered, but we both really wished we could, because it was sooooo delicious. 

Total damage for all that (plus he had a large Hite beer and my Iced tea) was around $35, so two good meals here for about the price of one not so great meal at El Burro Burracho.

If you're at the Rio or even a bit further, this place is well worth the Lyft fare.
