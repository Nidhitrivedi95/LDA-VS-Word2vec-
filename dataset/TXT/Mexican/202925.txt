pomGBqfbxcqPv14c3XH-ZQ Excellent!!! I had a last minute wedding to cater for about 30 guests. Leticia's was referred to me by a friend. The staff was very helpful and courteous and the food was top notch. I asked for the order to be ready at 4 and had some time to spare so I decided to pull up a chair and order a plate while I waited on my catering order to be completed. Boy, I was NOT disappointed on my first experience at Leticia's. Also, the wedding guests were similarly impressed. 

- Friendly staff, great food, awesome prices, and a great atmosphere makes for repeat customer. Thanks again Leticia!!!
