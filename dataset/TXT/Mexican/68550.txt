bMSiHjs2fbKbBNPyuTwhHA I'm gonna say four stars because the current overall of 2.5 is not warranted. Probably a 3.5, but anyway...

Clevelanders have been spoiled by Barrio, and if you go in with Barrio expectations you're going to be disappointed. However, if you take it for what it is then I think it's pretty good.

Great location! Right on the river, with tasteful beach decor. The service was fast and friendly, and I really like that you give your phone number and they text you when your table is ready, it gives you a chance to take a walk on the boardwalk while you wait.

I ordered the a shrimp and chicken taco, both pretty simple, but good. Here is where the Barrio factor comes in, the tacos are about the same price, but significantly smaller.

We also ordered the chips and salsa (yes they are extra unlike Barrio), with the roasted tomato and pineapple salsas, both good. The roasted tomato was hotter than I expected.

Lastly, I ordered a house margarita, good size, strength, and taste.

All in all, if you wanna try a new place and enjoy the river view then this place is a good choice, but if you are looking for a Barrio competitor then you'll be disappointed.
