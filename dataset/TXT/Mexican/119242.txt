GrwvBAEALujIOPQeOfN1vA Terrible. We will NEVER eat here again. The appetizer sampler was horrible and one of the items was so salty I almost spit it out! The pizza was cold in the middle which was surprising because the server warned us to be careful that the plate was hot. The manager came over to check on us and didn't even offer to comp the pizza after we told her it was cold! There wasn't an option for zero stars or I wouldn't have given them any.  Not worth it!
