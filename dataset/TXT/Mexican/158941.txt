ksuxxeP_V73Y4iKPeLq77A I ate breakfast here a couple of times and the breakfast burrito (and I ordered chorizo with it for an extra $1.50) doesn't disappoint. It's not huge, but filling enough for me not to have food coma afterwards. Equal portions of meat, eggs, etc in the burrito. The waitress who happened to help us was very friendly and took our orders soon after we were seated.
