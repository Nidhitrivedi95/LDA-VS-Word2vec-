M93N96pw4t_Rc3ACDm2dcw I like Pinto. Their ingredients are fresh, their burritos are made quickly and staff are friendly. I generally either go for their chicken burrito or chilli con carne. Both are tasty - juicy w lots of flavour. If you've been to North America or London l, maybe you've had a Chipotle burrito. Pinto reminds me of Chipotle (and that's a good thing!). The only thing I'm not a fan of is that they charge extra for guac. (I think they should include it in the cost!) 

The specific location has lots of seating, especially in the back. They have hot sauce if you sit in and the 'good kind' of plastic cutlery. 

Pinto have a loyalty scheme - buy 9 burritos and the 10th one is free! Expect to pay around £6 per burrito. Note - they can be busy during lunch time!
