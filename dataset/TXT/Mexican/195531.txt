OVn8rF10-r1QR9gvAlICrg This location is horrible. First off only some employees actually know how to work a credit card machine. If you have a card with a chip you might not want to go here I was just told they couldn't take my card. However two weeks ago no problem. I've been told this more then once here too. But the location on Elliot and McQueen no problem taking my form of payment and was pretty quick. I guess they will get my business from now on. Furthermore the wait is always ridiculous even if there is only one car in front. They just don't seem to have it together. Can't take your payment, getting orders wrong and the wait for fast food is too long. Get it together!
