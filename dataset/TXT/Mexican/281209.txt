XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Stopped in for a steak dinner and i assumed it would be great because of the price $45 (for just the steak no sides) first and this is Bobby Flays restaurant. Well i was wrong i would have rather ate at Fat Burger and saved my money. 

I ordered the New York and it was ok nothing special i also ordered the $8 sides the corn which was great and the twice baked potato that was terrible i didn't even finish it there was horseradish mixed in it and some orange sauce across the top which really threw me off. 

My man ordered the pork loin and it sucked the sauces that they put on the meat is all you can taste and it made it nasty the same thing with the filet mignon. The cioppino was in a green cilantro sauce and all you get is a little bowl. 

I would never eat here again it is definitely a rip off it didn't even taste good at all i was not impressed.
