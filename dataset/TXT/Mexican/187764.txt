o2nt0ZJP0WmdDL-4HV-p4w Food was good but when you order a chicken tostada one expects a chicken tostada and not a chicken with lettuce salad. We asked about that and apparently if you order a chicken tostada at dinner it is not the same from lunch and thus you do not get a crispy tostada with beans and chicken and letruce and all the fixins you just get chicken and lettuce. Service was really good and all the folks were friendly. We may give them a try again don't know yet.
