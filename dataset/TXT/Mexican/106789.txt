FMo1PJTUV5OpyiZlnTM1Rg I had the opportunity to try Sharky's before they opened, and I am impressed! I had the California Tacos (2 taco plate) and my boyfriend had the half-size Sharky's Chicken Salad. The tacos were perfect, and the side salad was really yummy. I loved the dressing they used. The chicken salad looked beautiful; so colorful!

I tried the house-made sangria (I love sangria), and it tasted so fresh! Sharky's also offers fresh juices, so we tried the watermelon basil and the hibiscus ginger. Delicious.

The atmosphere was perfect, for both casual and intimate dining. The lights are dim, but not so much that you can't see. There are booths, tables, and high tables. The ceiling is industrial-like (but the pretty kind), and the walls are wood. There's a huge window in the front which lets in great natural light (but not the glaring sun). There is an outdoor patio that's very nice as well!

I recommend signing up for the Fin-Addict rewards program (earn points for pre-tax food and drink)!

All in all, I highly recommend Sharky's in Summerlin!
