7D-ATDP9Ezr1ZehszsotOQ Upon further review, don't go combo meal!   The regular stand by of the combo meal maybe deemed as safe but not going to lead to happy taste buds.  As part of a party of four, those who went for regular meals fared better than the #5 or #8 combo.  Really chimichanga or chicken chipotle or #5 which sounds better to you?

The chicken chipotle was a very nice sauce.  It had a little bite and if you added more inside the tortilla it would make you sweat. I choose to add sour cream.  Chicken was perfect.  It comes with rice and beans.  In vegetarian options the potato chimi and cheese enchillita  were better than the ground beef options..  There must be a low level of beef in play here.  Twice in a row ground beef, didn't fare well.

The modela negra was a very nice change from the usual dos equis amber.
