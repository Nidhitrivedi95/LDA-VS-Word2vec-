JEQaPs7jNT1M2os9lJDlUA Cute and spunky place with delicious food! Ordered the crab cake appetizer and Brie and lavash... Both were delicious. The crab cakes are super authentic... Taste just like the ones you get in Baltimore. The food is pretty pricey and the portions are small...that's the only negative. But it is a local place, so it is somewhat justifiable. 

The people working there are a little bit awkward, but nice. 

Probably the best part about this place is that it is in an old house... It has a great ambiance and lots of character. Definitely a good place to check out and try in down town Phoenix!
