sh69ApUyPhAltAMpv5vX3w Let's just start by saying the food was amazing. It was what was expected from being told from friends and reading reviews. We came here to celebrate mothers birthday. Everything was going well until the miscommunication. 


What is disappointing is the bad the business. I understand the process of up selling- but you should advise if there is a big price difference. We pointed to a list of Herradura. $9 difference to $69. For someone who isn't well versed in spirits- how is one to know? Especially if the server knew this was our first time coming to this restaurant. 

We had an issue that we addressed with our server Marcos. That same night- error wasn't addressed properly. We go in the next day- to try and address this issue- we were first told "we can't help you with this issue as we are super busy" we were then told to come back later. My sister went in later to get this resolved. We were then told that this refund would be issued the following week.... 

The following week comes and we are charged each an additional amount. At this point I feel so disappointed ever coming here- This has just gone on too long and should not require numerous visits and emails and phone calls to resolve a miscommunication. I have never in my life have dealt with something like this when it comes to dining. 

Beware of this restaurant.
