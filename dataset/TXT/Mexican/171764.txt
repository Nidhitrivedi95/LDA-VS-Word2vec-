MAuSh7NKoT__CQ4BumoayA Awesome.  It was busy when we arrived and we were told it would be about a 15 minute wait.  We waited maybe 7 minutes.  Our friendly and professional server MICHAEL was pronto with our beverage order and our appetizer came shortly after.  We each ordered a combo and that arrived timely as well.  MICHAEL's timing with checking in was perfect.  The food here is ah-mazing.  The presentation is very nice.  The salsa is to-die-for good. In Vegas for 5 nights, we could eat anywhere but we had to come back here a few nights later for more.  Seated in another server's territory, MICHAEL spotted us and offered to start drinks for us ---- even remembered exactly what we had ordered the last time.  That is some service!  Our server on our second visit was RAFAEL, also awesome.   Totally recommend this place!
