GETVAz5SCk8rFziexV54Aw Did not even get a chance to try the food. They never delivered. Kept lying that the driver was out... for an hour and a half. After complaining for two hours to Eat24, I cancelled the order. Driver arrived over 2 hours after placing the order. You can figure out the details with that time in mind. Driver had my number all along. Never called. So it was not that he couldn't find me. I read the reviews and the food must be worth trying. Just don't ask for delivery.
