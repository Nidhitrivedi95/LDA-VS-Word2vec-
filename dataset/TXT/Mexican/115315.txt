We got the shrimp tacos and they are the best shrimp tacos I have ever had. The guacamole was very delicious and fresh. It was not bland at all - some other Yelp reviewer mentioned this. My husband and I tried the wontons and they were okay. They didn't have much filling in them. I would rather have less wontons with more filling. It is a bit pricey, but it is Vegas, everything in the Cosmo is expensive.
