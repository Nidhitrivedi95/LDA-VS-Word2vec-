vQq_sX0kSAUdT3yLW06q5A The shrimp tamale was by far the best dish at our table. If you are super hungry, you better order an appetizer and salad to go with it as it seams a bit smaller than a traditional tamale and comes with three grilled shrimp that sit on top. The sauce they smother it in is so tasty that if I were at home, I might have licked the plate clean. The tamale itself was sweet and full of flavor and the combo of the shrimp, tamale, and sauce was out of this world. 

This place has a TV in every corner with different games playing inside and an outside area which is out front.
