U8ixm-xr4QLjyD5L38ooAA Obviously came here at like 2.30AM after Clinton's. It was pretty busy, the service is fast and the burrito was fresh. There was way too much bean in my chicken burrito for my liking, I already have trouble coming to terms with the fact that a burrito is essentially carbs inside carbs...

Pretty average, I got mild and it wasn't spicy at all for me so definitely will go for half and half next time!

Very small place but looks clean and the servers were nice...even though I was slurring. Sorry "chicken" probably sounded like "sheeekaaahhh"
