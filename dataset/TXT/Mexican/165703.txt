lOmt6Edj6A4OZBUIUwtI8Q The veggie fajitas/ rice/ refried beans were ok- I would order them again (actually id probably get the black beans in place of the refried next time), but what really stood out about this place was the Guac and Salsa. 

I am let down so many times by the guac at places, but not at Tacos El Jefes. Whoever makes the Guacamole and Red Salsa here does a fantastic job.
