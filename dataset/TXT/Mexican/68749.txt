BMXeJPcosAxfLU-6baO_0Q I love this place.  I work nearby and I eat here several times a week, every week.  The value here is incredible.  The regular price for two tacos is only $3.50!  That would be a good price anywhere but for downtown, it's a great price.  On Taco Tuesday you get three tacos for $3.50!  We're talking about freshly grilled vegetables and grilled chicken breast - real meat, not fast-food reconstituted meat product, but real meat - and a full array of available toppings.  The tacos are delicious, soft or hard, especially with the spicy-tangy "Chipotle" sauce.  I don't order rice or beans so I can't comment on those but the meat and vegetables are consistently good.  The vegetables, tomatoes, and lettuce are always fresh, in fact all the ingredients (that don't come from a can) are.  I don't think they do pick-up but the regular service is fast, I usually only wait a couple minutes in line before my turn.  I have only a few tiny nitpicks, (1) not all of the employees are overly friendly (though some of the girls are awesome), (2) the corn tastes like it came out of a can, and (3) if they're not careful straining the tomatoes, you end up with tomato juices inside the taco and it can get soggy and can fall apart.  All told, though, these are minor complaints for a place that delivers great food at an extremely reasonable price.  This is my favorite places to eat lunch downtown in the theater district.
