I highly recommend spending the $2 and doing both. The mole sauce is divine when combined with the avocado and crema it is nirvana.  The Jamaica (hibiscus drink) is refreshing. The molletes is one of our favorite appetizers.  All in all the mesa location gets top marks for food and atmosphere. The servers are friendly and keep your drinks filled. Even when they are busy they make time for each table.
