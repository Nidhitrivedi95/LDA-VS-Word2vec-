5O02gK9VpnLZNC-aFnp6lQ Terrible service, terrible food. Upon our arrival, they let us know that we would. We'd to wait 15 to 20 mins because they were busy. We agreed (although there were only 3 tables and 2 servers). Then, after ordering our food, the pozole was extremely salty and the tostada Chacalosa had nothing but cucumbers and onions. This was so bad that after 5 years of using yelp, this is my first yelp review.
