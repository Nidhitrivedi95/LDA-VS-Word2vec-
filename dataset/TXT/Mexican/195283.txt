Ouh38adC9WbCRSSyYGtL3Q YUCKKKKK. Cheese dip is basically. Don't order, stay far away from this place. When asked if we can return our food the girl working.. Marisa or Maritza not sure, responded to our soupy, watery, disgusting  "dip" that's "that's how it always is"  and when asked if we can return it she said "well it costs money to make soooo..." and walked away. I can't even handle it. Also, Guac had lots of brown. But it costs money to make so we didn't even bring that up in risk of being walked away from again. I have NEVER experienced such awful "customer service" or disgusting food...
