mZZpoSSg9-PteV7EV-Keqg So I came in last week and I bought raspados and they over charged me by like $3. When I tried to get extra syrup, on the menu it said 50 cents but she charged me $1 and I confronted her polity and she started getting really disrespectful. And she put her hand in my face. Would not recommend rude service.
