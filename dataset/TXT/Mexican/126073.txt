hU7z5Jtl57RIODS0hPg9Ug My husband and I tried this place because of all the reviews about the fish tacos. And they were right! The tacos are amazingly delicious. The fish is huge and they pile on the toppings. I ordered two tacos but got full off of one. 

The beans and salsa are also very good with a lot of flavor. 

So glad we found this place!!
