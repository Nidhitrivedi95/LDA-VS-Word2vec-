T0dN9-NfwF_YD2fSQRu9AQ This is your typical neighborhood dive bar, nothing less and nothing more.  I was here for a dog meetup.  There was a very eccentric group of people here.  It was a Thursday night and pretty dead.  They offered free draft beers and well drinks for about an hour.  I swear everyone that was there had to be a smoker since there were constantly people going in and out to have a smoke break.  Had there not been a special event there I wouldn't have been there.  After seeing the scene and clientele there I can pretty much guarantee you that I won't ever be going back.  Just not my scene.
