zW0a510NN0P2n4tqKeIRBw I promise you this is the best Taco Bell in all of Las Vegas -they are efficient- they are consistent - they are competent and they are super super friendly -something you will not find at any/many fast food joints -they get your order out quickly and always correctly even tho they get busy as hell because they're open all night unlike most Taco Bell's
 kudos to this location -you rock!!
