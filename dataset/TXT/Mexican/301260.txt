zSicVxnJHV8indit0oFuNw So good last Saturday that we came again this Saturday. I saw the reviews for the great fresh made food but when I got to the place I thought I had the wrong address because it looks a little empty/ deserted. DONT LET THAT FOOL YOU - TRY IT!! It's nothing to look at, and the menu is small, but it's thoughtfully put together, and the food is fresh, tasty, plenteous, YUM!! We tried the breakfast burrito (homemade tortilla, heaps of fresh potato hash, eggs, bacon...) and the croque Monsieur with jalapeños (perfect comfort food, creamy, just the right amounts of ham, sauce, cheese, thick bread, toasted - with a fresh salad and homemade dressing) - and today tried the chilaquiles and steak quesadilla. Both excellent. Good music, clean, helpful staff. They are newly open so don't expect perfect operations yet, but a great community diner.
