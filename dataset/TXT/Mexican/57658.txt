a8pmtlVKf7NiSLI-4KejIw Read decent review on this place (not on Yelp) and decided to grab lunch here. They're a tapas style Mexican restaurant proudly boasting how authentic they are. We made reservations as Christmas Market is happening - I am so not down to wait in line. 

Once you walk in, you get overwhelmed with dias los muertos skulls and colourful murales and once it slowly steeps in, it's actually gorgeous. I am especially in love with the floor-to-ceiling alcohol wall. Simply beautiful display.

We ordered the guacamole en la mesa, ceviches classico, baja tacos y gobernador tacos. Guac was whatever expensive as well for a small amount (roughly a cup for $11).. they mash it on the spot in a molcajete which is probably the best part of the guac. The ceviches was just plain rip off... 1/4 cup for $12 had a few pieces of fish lime juice and cucumber and bam you have an "authentic ceviches". The tacos was just tacos.. Kensington has better tacos for cheaper.

Waitress was nice. Checked in on us here and there so no complaints on the service.

Overall, I would not come back. I feel that I can get "authentic" Mexican food elsewhere for a better price.
