8w_PzYVk6cR37lpR-SWMog Service was rude. All the tables and floors were so dirty. We asked for something to clean a table and the person had to ask the manager. They finally cleaned our table and left all the other ones dirty. There was food and paper and lids on the floor. Makes you wonder how dirty the area is where they prepare the food. There was only one other person who came in after us so they were not busy, but by the time we got our food it was cold. They had to remake some of it.  Last time we went there they had run out of chicken. Probably won't go there again.
