iN3SrF5NO0xSf6umeUws-Q My husband and I came here around 1130 pm on a Wednesday night via drive through. We decided to stray from our normal Mexican joint and try somewhere new which I found was a big mistake later on. We ordered an enchilada plate, 2 taco plate, one chile relleno, and one bean cheese burrito (yes, I was hungry and wanted to try everything). We figured we had to wait a while for all that food but surprisingly it came out really fast and smelled yummy. THE FOOD WAS SO DISAPPOINTING. Everything I tasted was cold except the refried beans and I think that was because it was already cooking in a pot, I see why it came out so fast. I've tasted better enchiladas, the cheese was not melted inside and tasted like those packets of shredded cheese that they sell at the markets, which was so disappointing. The only thing yummy was the tacos that my husband ordered. I was so looking forward to my alcohol with Mexican food at home and that just went down the drain. It upsets me when my food doesn't taste good especially when looking forward to it. Never again.
