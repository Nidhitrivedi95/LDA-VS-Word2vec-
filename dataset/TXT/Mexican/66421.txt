BEplfZTUzYwApjMUaOA12w Went here for happy hour (late night) and it was a very solid experience. We had the opportunity to sit right on the "canal" which added to the experience. Service was great and the $3-5$ happy hour drinks really can't be beat. Mexican food as I've said a million times is hard to screw up or make stand out. Food here was perfectly adequate albeit a bit over priced (welcome to Vegas).
