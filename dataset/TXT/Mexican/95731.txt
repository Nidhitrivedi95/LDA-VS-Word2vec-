EHDcxAlrrP4VPiZuQlrIrg We've been here quite a few times and my previous review reflected those visits, but we went on Monday night 7/19 and the first thing we noticed was that the music was really LOUD, so loud that we could barely hear each other when we tried to talk and found that the waitress was having the same problem. We ordered a Coconut Margarita, but got a regular one, I asked for shredded beef tacos and got ground beef. We also noticed that the bean dip was extremely bland and its always been very good and when I received my chile relleno, there was hardly any sauce on it. I had to ask the waitress to bring me a cup of it to put on top. 

I hope that they were just having an off night, but it would help if they would turn down the music so you can talk to your friends and maybe the waitress will be able to hear you and get your order right!
