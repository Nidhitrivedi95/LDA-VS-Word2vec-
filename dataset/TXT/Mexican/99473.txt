eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg Wow! Went to the yard this morning as I do often on Sunday's and actually met Chef Silvana ! I was delighted!! I am a huge fan of hers! She is a true artist in the culinary world. As I read some earlier posts about chef not offering chips and salsa I can't help thinking that those who think this venue is lacking do not get her concept. Barrio is not your " run of the mill Mexican food " if you want chips and salsa go to manuals ! As far as pricy think the old saying " you get what you pay for " applies.
