4enw_5SjmPuVpxg8MhbPBw Maybe there is a learning curve given how new the location is, but most of what I ordered was inedible :o(

The menu looks fantastic and clearly the concept is solid but something major is getting lost in the prep process.

The guac was the worst thing, and the fish taco I threw away because the 'fish' was an inedible brick.

No heating, grilling, broiling etc of any kind took place...just assembly. I am confused as I ordered an enchilada/taco platter.

Luckily I had a cupcake from elsewhere to chase the nightmare away...
