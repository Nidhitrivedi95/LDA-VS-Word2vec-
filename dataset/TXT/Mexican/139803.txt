J5ebC7fKqrSF8KuS8d6hgw Great food. Great ambiance. I met my parents and fiance for dinner here after work. We had missed happy hour but still indulged in the margaritas ($8) and wine as well as appetizers. The stuffed peppers and guacamole were delicious. So simple, so good. I've had "upscale" Mexican food at other restaurants (ones that try to turn burritos and quesadillas into 5 courses) and this is actually a great example of what upscale Mexican food should be. It isn't just tacos and burritos, but if that is what you are in the mood for, they have it.

 Everyone at my table had something different, Buttermilk Chicken, North Central Chicken, Sergio's Pork Tenderloin (espresso chocolate rubbed :) ) and the Chicken Enchiladas. It was all delicious and we all loved ours but my personal favs were Sergio's Pork Tenderloin and the Chicken Enchiladas. Yum Yum. My meal, the Chicken Enchiladas was technically an appetizer but it was SO much food, overflowing with sauce and cheese, I don't know how you would split this as an app and my recommendation is take it as an entree. We also finished the meal with the famous bread pudding which is made using a croissant base rather than regular bread. Yes, this helps explain why it is so fantastic. 

Only negative on the evening was the house wine ended up being $13/glass (and no we didn't have just one). I had looked over the wine list before ordering my marg (good choice) and they had glasses starting at $6 so it is surprising the house wine was over twice that. Maybe the waitress hustled us. Overall, besides that little blemish, service was very good even with the place bustling on a Tuesday evening. 

Parking--I wasn't fortunate enough to make it in the parking lot, but the street did the job fine and wasn't more than a minute walk. 

Will definitely be again (and we recommend reviewing the wine list before ordering :)  If your going to spend $13/glass, it may as well be something you love)
