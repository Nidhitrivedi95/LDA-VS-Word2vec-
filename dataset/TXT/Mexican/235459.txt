SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA My family and I have heard great things about this restaurant! After eating here I will be recommending and eating here more often. Great food and great service! It was my parents and I first time trying this place, and it did not disappoint. The place was packed, so we had a 10 minute wait. When we sat down we were given salsa and chips and soup. We ordered the steak fajitas for two that came with beans and rice. It was $28 so I think it's a great offer! When the food came out the presentation of the fajitas was amazing! The portions are pretty large so it's quite filling and really flavorful and tasty! If you love Mexican food than this is the place to go! I love the variety of the menu so when I come back I will try more things off the menu, this place gets my seal of approval.
