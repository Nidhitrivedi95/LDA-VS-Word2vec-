 Delicious Mesquite enhanced Meats with weak side dishes in a strange dated atmosphere that is self serve with friendly help. 



The full story-
I read in The New Times that Chef Binkley thinks that CC's Mesquite Broiler is one of Phoenix's Best kept secrets and he comes here for the White Fish Tacos so I wanted to check it out.

We entered and weren't sure if someone would seat us and figured out that you order at the bar and grab a small traffic cone with a number and seat yourself at a table or booth or patio. While your waiting you grab some chips and salsa from the complimentary salsa bar and then you take in the atmosphere. It's kinda like sea shore graffiti meets 1980's MTV with some big screen TVs and a tropical bar.

One of the bartenders runs out our food to us and it's mostly on disposable ware. I got the White Fish Taco Platter. I taste a piece of the fish and it's MIGHTY DELICIOUS with that mesquite taste. I received two smaller sized tacos, Spanish Style Rice and Lard Free Beans. The fish inside the tacos was very good. For me they were too heavy with the sauce but were tasty. I didn't like the rice or beans. The rice tasted very processed to the level were I couldn't eat it. The beans had some seasoning but tasted mostly like bean water....

My husband had the 1/4 lb Tri Tip Platter. I tasted a small piece and it was REALLY DELICIOUS! Tender, moist, beefy, mesquite...just delicious! He got more sides than I did. Spanish Style Rice, Lard Free Beans, Chopped Cabbage Salad and Tortillas. The rice and beans he was able to eat and he also ate mine but he agreed with me that the rice tasted very processed and he also said the beans lacked flavor.

I'll return sometime because the meats we tried were very tasty from the mesquite but will order dishes without rice or beans.
