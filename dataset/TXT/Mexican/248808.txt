The complimentary salsa and chips are delicious (they give you medium to start, but if you like it more or less spicy you can just ask!) and all of the food is just spectacular. I like to change up my order every time (and have never been disappointed), but other members of my family will order the same thing over and over--just because it's that good!

Service is very quick and always on point. The vibe is fun and very relaxed. It's just a great place to grab a quick and delicious meal with the family (and overeat on chips and salsa!)
