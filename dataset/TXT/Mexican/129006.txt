i2YFMkIMqstA9GxUkcigYw I guess when I saw 4 stars I expected more.  I just ordered 3 chicken tacos.. not hard at a Mexican place right?  The chicken is red, there's only one kind of cheese, I was forced to listen to a Mexican music station the entire time, all customers (less two) were speaking Spanish the entire time, and the entire staff spoke Spanish the entire time.. it looked clean.. the staff seemed nice..I ate 1 1/2 tacos, didn't like them, threw the rest away, and walked out thinking 1) I wouldn't come back 2) I didn't like that food and 3) at least it wasn't McDonalds next door...
