What a great day in Kensington to be munching on Mexican food.  We first stopped by here on Pedestrian Sunday.  You know a place is bumping when there's a huge line-up and many people walking out of the store and happily munching away food outside.

Agave y Agucate is a very tiny little store; with a bakery in the front and a cramped little space in the back.  There's only one chef that worked there - and he was working his butt off.  The line up there was huge, and many people were waiting there for the deliciousness that was going to come their way.  My friends and I all ordered the tingo tostada; the tostada (basically a fried/toasted tortilla) with fried beans, pulled chicken, avocado, onions and Mexican crema.  You can see it that he takes him time and effort into every single tostada.  

Although service was a bit slow, and the place was a bit cramped - the food was delicious.  A great place to grab a little snack on a sunny stroll in Kensington (however, you might want to be careful and avoid dropping this on your clothes).
