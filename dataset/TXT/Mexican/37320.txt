5sqC0kX6lBvKR983T_EBcg Here in Phoenix finding a Mexican food joint is about as difficult as finding an UN-shaded parking spot.
Being relatively new to the city, I haven't had the pleasure of having Mexican regularly at my disposal and at different levels of service/price/atmosphere etc.
Cafe Rio sits nicely in a niche all it's own.
First of all it's like a fiesta in there! The decor is festive and fun. It's usually BUSY!! Especially between 11:30am and 2pm and 5pm-7pm. It's kid friendly too so there are always tons of little frijoles jumping around making a racket so I generally take out. 
The food is AWESOME!! It's all homemade and with bountiful portions! The have a different special everyday and all of their tortillas are make in-house. Everything comes smothered in your choice of delectable toppings: guacamole, cilantro, salsas, pntos, black beans, sour cream, cheeses...
The drinks fountains include all the usual suspects as well as several house-made delights like mint-lime lemonade and traditional horchata, all bottomless!
The salads are perfect for those carb-a-phobes like myself who just want greens protein and fat! 
The service is cafateria-style, line up and get ready to order cuz it's fast and furious until you get to the till, kinda like Speedy Gonzales and Subway had a baby.
The prices are decent and they even have a frequent-diner card that earns you freebies. Now I know many of the more traditional Mexican places in town are dirt cheap, but uh, the key word there is dirt...you get what you pay for and you get it in spades here!
Perfect for anyone wanting something quick and deliciously nutritious. Eat in or take-out it's all good! They may not sell booze, but it's a culinary carnival just the same!
Yo quiero Cafe Rio! Con muchos amor amigos!
Hasta pronto!
