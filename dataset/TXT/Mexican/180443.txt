We checked in and claimed a free grilled corn, if you love grilled corn do yourself a favor and check in on Yelp to get in on this deliciousness! For my main entree I ordered one salmon and one vegetarian taco. Unfortunately they came out cold and weren't bursting with flavor but I was hungry so I didn't say anything about it. My boyfriend had ordered the ensaladas and his edge cold as well, so he let out server know. Our server kindly took them and heated them up for him in the oven and when they came out they were perfect! Our server was very attentive an on his A game with making sure we always had what we needed without being too overbearing. I will definitely be back and can't wait to try some of their delicious looking drinks on their menu.
