pup46G8qFBG8695RtbQNwA Ummmmm I'm not sure if the people have had good Mexican before, buuuuut this place is definitely NOT good. Their margaritas are made with lime koolaid. The guacamole is store bought. And not just like ok let's use it as a base and then spruce it up before we serve it NO they walked over to basha's opened a container of wholly guacamole and slapped it on a plate! There ya go! So disappointed! We asked for more chips and they never came so we couldn't even finish our $7 store bought guacamole. THEN to top it off...... we were asked to leave our table because we were done eating and just watching the live band but the "waiter needed to seat someone else" I've never been asked that in my entire life.
