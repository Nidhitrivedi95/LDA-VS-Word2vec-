6zi7dAlnk7vgvlGbUMoKkA What I like about Maverick Rock Taco is that it's in a really cool area and it has a laid back vibe that serves really good food.  I ordered the Fish taco special for that night and I was over joined that they accomodated my request to not have a tortialla and brought it to me "naked".  The Mahi Mahi was delish and the quac was great!  The restaurant was clearly busy and you could tell that it's a popular place!

My only thing was that they brought out my white wine in a semi-dirty glass and it was room temp...say 70 degrees room temp.  :-( Oh well...I drank it and it still tasted good but just don't like warm white wine.  

This will be a frequent place for sure for a quick casual bite during the week or a place to hang with friends!
