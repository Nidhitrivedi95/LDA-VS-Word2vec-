ITOa1olD2HTgEVOnH8zVog I am usually a veg head but next time I do crave meat, I will be coming to this place for my protein fix.

What to order?
I ordered the chicken burrito which came with finely diced tomatoes and onions. The  burrito was shy of any other veggies which usually I would frown upon but the chicken was so tasty that I wouldn't complain.
