VnvRZia9M18-IUarfdnYfA Came here to meet a friend for lunch.  I didn't expect too much as I had a bad experience at another Mucho Burrito in the east end.  The burrito I had there was tiny, soggy and tasteless.  I figure we would give this one a try since there wasn't much in this plaza.  I ordered the regular meat burrito.  You can pick pull pork, chicken, and some other meat that was drenched in sauce.  I went with the less sodium infused option which I think was the chicken.  I also got them to put it on whole wheat and also got the brown rice.  They charge extra for quac but it didn't look too good so I told them not to put it on.  I also had them put in some jalapeno peppers which I expected to be spicy but it was not at all.  Once they wrapped up my burrito, it did look like the increased the portion sizes a bit because I don't remember the burrito looking like that at the other place.  The servers were friendly and very quick.  The portion was fine but I still think they can improve on taste.  It still wasn't that tasty, maybe it was the lack of spices.  I like Mexican food but this places just doesn't cut it for me.  I'll give it 3 stars for being okay as it did fill me up but definitely lacked taste.
