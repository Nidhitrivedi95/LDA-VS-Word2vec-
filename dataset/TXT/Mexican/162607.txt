l8gyfK0w0lrQqbPReObf5w I got a number 10 and it was the best I have had in a long time!!! It was just right in all ingredients. I did have to wait for a bit but once the realized I was there they stopped doing what they were doing and came over. The only reason I give them 4 stars this visit is because they did not have any Dr. Pepper!! But I cànt blame them for not having the world's most wanted drink
