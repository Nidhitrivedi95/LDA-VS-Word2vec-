wAXYLmHuysYTz8i4VPKmaQ I only came to this location because it's close to my apartment. I sat in the dining room and watched 6 crew members and what seemed to be a manager in a polo walk by several dirty tables without a second glance. They obviously don't have integrity in the feel of their restaurant. I saw a female with dark medium length hair wearing a long necklace on the service line and the back counters were so messy it made me question the standards and food quality. With there being more people on shift than people inside the restaurant I would have expected better service.
