0qOI8lOZvvhrbtxqjaBQMg Today was my first time here, and I'm sorry I didn't read the tips and reviews first. I think I would have ordered one of their famous burritos. Instead I ordered two fish tacos. I'm not a fan of breaded and deep fat fried fish ..... brought me back to the days of semi-soggy fish sticks that my older sister used to make because that's all she knew how to cook. However, I am thankful that I ordered the chips and salsa. The salsa was amazing. I look forward to giving this place another try because it's very conveniently located for me and I love authentic Mexican fare. Worth a second chance for sure!!
