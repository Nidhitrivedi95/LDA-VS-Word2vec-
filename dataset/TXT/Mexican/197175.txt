oxv2UyI5yF6yawPU20tOxA Nice little place for outdoor patio dining, and the Staff is very friendly. I had the nachos, I really didn't care for it. It had some spicy sauce on it instead of cheese. My wife had the Flautas w/ mole sauce. She didn't like the mole sauce but after scraping it off, she liked the flauta w/ beef. We will be back to try some other dishes, but until then....3 stars
