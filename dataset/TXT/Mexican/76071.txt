CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q You can understand how Tacos El Gordo has earned their reputation after one visit. The food here is simple yet perfect. Spicy pork? YES. Roasted nopales? UH HUH. Perfect asada? OH BABY. This is the way Tijuana-style tacos should be done. 

A warning for the newcomer: this place can get crazy busy, really packed with people, and figuring out where and what to order can be a bit overwhelming. Stick through the awkwardness of the first time and you will be handsomely rewarded.
