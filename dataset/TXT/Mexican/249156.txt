UFVy-8WC7pDzvBUzOvdwzA After moving here from Austin Texas I'm not sure anywhere can really compare but I had a good experience here! I had the jalapeño watermelon margarita and it was delicious! I ordered the black bean torta and it was HUGE I couldn't finish it all even though I wanted to! The service was a little bit slow, but we also did have a large group!
