FI-8LPGkc8D_hwx0l0zyyg My husband and I really enjoyed our dinner here.  Our waitress, Veronica,was very friendly and had great recommendations. They have a great selection of margaritas and tequilas.  I had a taco combination plate with a crispy shrimp, BBQ pork, and chicken taco   They were all really good but I recommend the crispy shrimp.  And the street corn was really good too.  My husband had chili Verde enchiladas and he said it was excellent. My only complaint was the music inside the restaurant was a bit loud. Otherwise excellent service and food.
