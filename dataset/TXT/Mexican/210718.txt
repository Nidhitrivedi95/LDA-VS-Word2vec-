qnn9E-e9orYf_wK37yLTYw 10 of us literally walked out of the restaurant after we ordered and was berated by manager Brad Sowery. On what looked like a very slow night 2 of us arrived early and had to interrupt the bartender from talking to a friend to get a drink. We all sat, ordered drinks and this mgr came over and said he was letting us know ahead that he wouldn't allow us to have more than one drink because he thought we didn't need more. He talked to us ladies about our body weight, that we don't look like we can handle alcohol, continuously insulting us. We wanted to order food but he continued to lecture. The average age was 50, we were having fun and enjoying each other's company like the only other two tables in the restaurant. Horrible manager=horrible restaurant.
