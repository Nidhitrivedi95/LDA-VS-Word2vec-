xWpy6al-9u02BZz00Kbbyg We are on our way to So Cal from Texas in our RV so we came here while staying down the road at the Canyon Trails RV park. The food was pretty good. It was fresh, which was nice.

The combo came with far too much food for me to finish. My husband got the spicy shrimp dish, which he liked.

It was good, but nothing special. Service was okay.
