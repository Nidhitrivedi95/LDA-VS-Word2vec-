FMo1PJTUV5OpyiZlnTM1Rg Mexican food is one of my favorites and I was excited to see the Mac Shack (which I didn't care for) replaced by a potential good new place.  When my wife and I first entered and saw the walk up and order counter, my expectations took a hit towards the negative and I thought, "Crap...  I wonder if it's the same owners just trying Mexican food now?"   I like to sit down, have a waitress or waiter, etc. so, was a strike here.  Next, the prices were sit down and have a  waitress or waiter prices as well as far as I was concerned but we were there and going to move forward with things.  We ordered away, and found ourselves a seat  with a slight detour to the salsa bar on the way to the table (we were given a small thing of chips) and we munched while we waited and the salsas tasted pretty good.  

Well, the food came out relatively quickly and I must say, we really enjoyed it. The chicken fajita style tacos I had were really tasty and my wife and I shared a large nacho which was pretty decked out and tasty as well. Further, she had some quinoa salad of some sort that she enjoyed.    

Overall, the food was the real star of this place and it was tasty.  I wasn't too fond of the process previous to that.
