Nothing special. We ordered the taco platter (I ordered the shrimp taco, fish and carne asada) The fish taco fell apart from being too wet (I'm guessing from the salsa they put on) and the carne asada was lackluster. 

Service wasnt amazing and there was only us and one other party there so who knows what they were up to while they were all hanging out in the kitchen.
