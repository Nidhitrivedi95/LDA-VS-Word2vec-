ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA Would have been nice we had looked forward to dining here but the hostess was a f#%k'n bitch. They were full but it's pretty common to take your name and give a approx time they can seat you... no such professional accommodations.. good luck but Vegas will soon discharge you of your attitude..too many other great places and cool people to break bread with..
