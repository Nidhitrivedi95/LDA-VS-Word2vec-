Fkj8vJocYilePMZv2y54WA I actually think this place is pretty good. The salsa bar is pretty good. I usually get a breakfast burrito or carne asada tacos. The service is always fast and friendly. The bathrooms are pretty clean. for the price and the convenience you can't really complain. it's not fancy but the food is pretty consistent and flavorful.
