I went to the upstairs bar and the bartenders were really nice, I didn't catch their names but they (man and woman) had an awesome way of paying attention to each person there and making all the drinks upstairs. I had the crispy cola-lime pork and some homemade flour tortillas. The pork was AMAZING. I had the pumpkin bread pudding for dessert and it was so, so, so, good. If you're in the area, go!
