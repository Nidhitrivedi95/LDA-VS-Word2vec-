Ordered four tacos to go. Short drive home but they were soggy eat-with-a-fork failures by the time we ate them. One problem is the tacos were wrapped in foil. Good way to turn a hard shell into mush. Would paper be too much trouble? Or Moe's could choose not to allow hard taco take outs because the food quality suffers along with the reputation of the business.

Moe's filled the sack my tacos were in with tortilla chips. No salsa in the sack and, more importantly, none was offered. I would have happily paid for something to dip the chips in. The chips went in the trash.

Most disappointing was the staff. The person who prepared my order seemed more interested in the personal conversation he was having with a coworker than he was in my order. Then the cashier, who was out of the room for several minutes, left me with the impression she was doing me a favor by taking my money. No eye contact. No thank you. No "sorry you had to wait", just an attitude.
