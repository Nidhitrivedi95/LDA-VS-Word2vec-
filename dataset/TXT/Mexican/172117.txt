mB_cI1tCrNxxvr2e2myNrQ Taco Bell and Booze. What more do you want?

We wanted to be pretty low-key our first night in Vegas, so we decided on Taco Bell and alcohol for dinner. 

It's pretty much your standard Taco Bell, just with merchandise and alcohol. 

There's a variety of drinks you can choose from and then you choose your alcohol: Vodka, Tequila, Rum or something else I can't remember :)

I decided on a Cherry Icee with 2 shots of vodka. It was glorious. Along side my crunch-wrap, it was pretty much the best taco bell dinner I've ever had.
