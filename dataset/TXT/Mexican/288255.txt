Yevhl8bTwdJuu_LWKv-4Fw Times have changed.  My wife and I used to visit Paladar all the time, but then we moved out of Cleveland about a year ago.  We were back in town to visit family and were very excited to have lunch there while back in town.  Big disappointment.  I have really missed the Ropa Vieja but what I had today was not nearly as good as about a year ago.  It used to have so much flavor, but today it was pretty bland and uninteresting.  It also looks like their guacamole station is just for show now because the guac we ordered came from the kitchen and was brown on top, so it had clearly been sitting (we had a late lunch, so who knowns how long ago they made it).  Plus, it was ok, chipotle does have better though, and it is green there though probably not fresh.  The plantains were still delicious and the tacos were pretty good, but not what they used to be.  Lastly, we had not been there in a while but we had an old punch card for a free lunch.  Since we left they stopped using punch cards but the waiter let us use it anyway, we thought.  But first he brought the check without taking it off, then he brought it back with only the guac taken off, no explanation.  We looked through all the literature they include with the bill and figured out that now they don't give you a free lunch for being a regular, with a punched card, only a small order of guacamole. Oh well, we moved, but we definitely aren't going to rush back.  If you haven't been in a while listen to this post and the other posts on yelp that agree that things aren't as good as they used to be, and the customer service is a little spotty.
