LtO6vTBfYzlgWArn3kRe_A the HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE out weighs the good food by far! Just because i dont speak your language doesn't mean you have to be rude to me. I would've tipped the cooks big because I work for tips but with that bad attitude i just wanted to leave. Came home to my food with very little meat on my tacos & nothing else on them, when I really wanted everything. The cook even asked me if I wanted everything and I said yes.. Smh really disappointed. The Charleston location wouldn't do this to me on their busiest day.
