JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg Been here twice in the last week.  We really like this place however during the last two visits something seemed to be off with the food.  Don't know if Chef Paco was not there the last two times or not?

The service was good the last two times, we walked in were seated right away and offered drinks.  On this very last visit when the chips and salsa were brought to the table the chips seemed hard and stale tasting which at first seemed odd as we've never had this before.  

The rice, normally amazing buttery flavor with cilantro both this time and last week was really dry and not flavorful like it used to be.

Last week I had the steak fajitas which were seasoned really well, the rice was bland and not like usual.  Last night I got the ribeye deciding to try something new and it was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing, however the rice was again dry and bland, not like it used to be.  Also my daughter got the fajitas this time and the guacamole they brought with her dish looked old and dry.

My wife's dish which was the soup and a sandwich, also did not taste like it was seasoned the way it used to be.  I really like this place but my wife was not happy the last two visits which is really sad.

The staff is amazing, on top of everything, it just seems like the kitchen is not the same.  I hope we will be back but it's up to the boss, two bad visits for her normally does not go back for a third disappointment.
