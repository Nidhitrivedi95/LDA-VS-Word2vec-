DugcfgyM4DhDldK_jsF0Xw This is my 1st visit and will be my last.  They say first impressions are lasting well yes! Yes they are.  The place was not clean the bar where pico is was disgusting, and i thought to myself someone needs to clean or change the pico.  Then i went to look for a table and couldn't find a clean table, i had to clean one myself.  Not sure if i will another location a chance probably wouldn't be fair to X them all out.  But it will take a minute for forgiveness.  My husband did not enjoy his food at all. His chicken wasn't hot and they had his plate of rice waiting on the counter where other patrons are over his food.  Bad food changed his whole attitude lol i guess hunger and disappointment makes u a beast i will buy him a snickers
