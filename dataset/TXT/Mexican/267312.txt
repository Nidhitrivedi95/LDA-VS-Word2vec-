wjf1uZNr6E4LQ0nUNHX5AA I'm familiar with Rivas from their other locations across the Valley, but recently have been frequenting this one out of convenience. Menu is extensive, prices are low, portions are large, and service is fast and polite. I always seem to get the same cashier, he's a sweetheart. 

GOOD: Get the fajitas. I prefer the steak, chicken and shrimp are also available. The burritos are also pretty solid, but be sure to check what ingredients they include and add on what you want (ie cheese, sour cream). Their asada and carnitas meats are probably my favorites, but the shrimp is nicely seasoned too. Quesadillas are awesome. 

OKAY: The sopes and salads are not my favorites, more of a one and done choice for me. I'm also not really into their tortas, which all come with thousand island dressing. I gravitate more toward their traditional dishes rather than their Americanized ones. Their guac is a $2.25 add-on fee and is more of a sauce rather than chunky like I prefer.

TIPS: Website says you can order through Eat24, but that isn't set up through their Yelp page (womp womp). Chicken tacos are BOGO. Free WiFi available (pw "rivas123").

EDIT: Dropping a star. The past three times I've ordered online here, I arrive and no one knows anything about my order. They eventually make it fast but then get sloppy, giving me puddles of grease and minimal cheese. Not super thrilled.
