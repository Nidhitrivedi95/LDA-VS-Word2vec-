E-_5sSD4Ofc8s7I8bMSidA It was just okay... The other burrito places are better in my opinion.  Like Chorizo or Burrito Boyz or Much Burrito.  
Not much value for the money.  I was expecting higher quality.  I might go back to try the steak buritto though because they grill it to order.  Very competive space, this place needs to work on the flavours/value if they want to survive.
