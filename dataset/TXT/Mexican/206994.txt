q50PTYB15EO2jEwgv-9vrA Went on Cinco de Mayo...packed of course.  I have been to the Si Señor in Kamm's Corners.  I like the decor and ambience at the Kamm's Corners location better but the food at the Broadview location tasted better.  Damn, their salsa is so good.  Mild with nice cilantro flavor.  Fast, friendly service.
