zS3-CKZVVvUYvasJnAg-aA I live nearby and there are at least 6+ "...berto"-style Mexican fast food joints within a mile.  While I miss the former Chinese Buffet's fried chicken, this is THE GEM in Tempe for fast food! Huge menu, helpful staff. Poliberto's Tacos de Lengua are the best anywhere! Beef Enchiladas are so full of tender meat, onion, & chile (bell pepper). The "Salsa Bar" with sauces, cucumber, radish, limes, and Jalapenos/carrots en escabeche are such welcome condiments/sides. Everything I've ordered here over the years has been excellent, & the prices give the very best value. I just wish that they had (1) rajas of roasted poblano chile, not just mild bell pepper, (2) AZ-style green chile (for burros), & (3) Piquancy or "Chilosity" - nothing  - not even the salsa de molcajete - is picante, just mild. iPor favor! So, you may need to stand in line for a while to order, but do it... It's really worth the wait! .I may even head over there tonight ... again!
