y2e1DgIUBlERep7hrKz2-w Hadn't been to Arriba in ages...what's wrong with me?  :-)

Started with Queso Fundido (well, chips and salas and bean dip - spicy bean dip - yeah, baby!  Then the Queso).  Our server asked if we wanted chorizo in it?  Half the table said no, so he put some on one side.  Good thing - I don't think the chorizo really fit the flavor profile of the queso fundido.  It was served flaming - cool effect!

I ordered the New Mexico style Enchiladas (flat, stacked), but asked to have a fried egg on top (to make it more New Mexican).  I went with the spicy red sauce option.  The flavors were good, but the tortillas were a little on the tough/hard side - almost needed a knife to cut them.

Still, tasted really good - and had  enough to have them again for lunch today (and I fried another egg for the leftovers :-))

Everybody in our party enjoyed their meals - what more can you ask?

Give 'em a go!
