eem6eoAiYL9UcQUE0kMD-g I've been coming here for years and the food is always amazingly good!!! The menudo is bomb every single breakfast plate is delicious and the pancakes omg so good! I highly recommend this place definitely real Mexican food. What I love the most is that everyone there is very friendly.
