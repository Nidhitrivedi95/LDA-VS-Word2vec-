Wht6JaY_yLIb3usuPvSulA Went there yesterday, ordered 3 different seafood plates. From oysters, shrimp cocktail to ceviche. Besides the Oysters, In the back of my head I knew the Seafood texture was off but ignored it. Thought probably I was just being picky ---- flash-forward  to today - I am very bloated and have the biggest Stomach pain ever. I know its from eating here. 
Tip: Don't eat here. 
Moral: Listen to your intuition. 

Hope it helps. You're welcome.
