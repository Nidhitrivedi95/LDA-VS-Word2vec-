UqhVZYUeoBGroYpZB-9jlQ Chillis to me has always been a hit n miss type place. Todays lunch was a miss for sure..food came out a lil long, my food seemed over cooked the ribs was not tender my bbq chicken was a lil dry my seasoned frys were cold. Bout the only thing good was my corn on the cob. My pictures look great but the meal itself was just blahhh...this is why i don't come to chillis very often. Would i recommend it , no way! Service was horrible we basically had to hunt down a server for our water refills n a few other things such as more napkins. Smdh! I will not be coming back, hooters is next door that is were ill be....
