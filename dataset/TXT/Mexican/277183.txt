Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ More expensive than Newport Beach Javier's restaurant prices, but I guess you're paying a premium for  being in a Vegas casino. The menu is the same just higher prices. The layout and ambiance is very nice. The salsa was not as spicy as the one here in Newport, but the lobster enchiladas were exactly the same and just as good! The service was fast and attentive.
