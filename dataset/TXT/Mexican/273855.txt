x2CLU-qw2Hpwu2vSGLEorg I had two demands when my better half was relocated to Vegas 1) a house with a pool  2) Finding an El Salvadorean place to get pupusas. 

I love Pupusas because they invite you to partake in a bit of Mayan culinary antiquity. Masa lovingly rolled by hand and slapped on a sizzling grill, topped with cabbage curtido and a light tomato salsa. My favorite is the queso con loroco pupusa's. Loroco is a fragrant mesoamer  flower whose herbal leaves are mixed with the cheese and stuffed inside the masa_Divine I say!  The platanos are also very good here. The pupusa's here are lard free and very light, which is really key. A great vegetarian dinner for about 6 dollars. Be prepared, this is a homestyle joint, with blaring telemundo and sticky floors~ but it all adds to the autheticity and great meal.
