YCVAc-MG8--2An9erAo7NQ Afternoon staff are good. But this evening I went for a burrito bowl and the food handler put a Tablespoon worth of rice, and just enough beans to cover it. My kid has had more filling in a kids meal at other Chipotle locations. Anyway, after requesting more rice and beans, they charged me extra. Really low. Probably won't go back in the evening.
