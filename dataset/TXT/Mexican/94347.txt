E6DmUAHfSRCEakvknot-zA The ceviche is life! $35 for a jumbo size! Definitely should've shared it! But the restaurant is amazing! The food is authentic! A little pricey but worth every penny! Highly recommend if you like mariscos and live banda! Just expect to spend about $100ish for two... but the portions are huge!
