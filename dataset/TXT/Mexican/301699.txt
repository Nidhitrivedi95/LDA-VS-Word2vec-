zVyi1UCU8XPcULQEzioE_g Waited close to 2 hours for the food to arrive. My order was wrong ( I ordered 1 less ingredient) and was told my the manager this is the way it comes. And that I should leave and pay or else they are calling the cops. It's a family restaurant and the manager is the one who spoke like this to my group. Very very unprofessional.
