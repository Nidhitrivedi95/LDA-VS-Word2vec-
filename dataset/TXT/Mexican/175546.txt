mPbD-VWOrkvYqPL4ifUhAQ The food here is good, but service is bad. Don't go if you have any special dietary requirements. I am vegan, so I ordered the bean and cheese burritos and asked for guacamole to be substituted for the cheese (undoubtedly the most expensive ingredient) and sour cream. Nope. There are plenty of places who appreciate my business and would happily make this substitution. I won't be back.
