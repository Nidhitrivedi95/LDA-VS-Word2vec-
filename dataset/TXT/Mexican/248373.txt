u8CFMZ9rCMDvKGDyqt6MEQ What a great surprise in Waunakee!

Authentic food with a broad menu of choices.  The chips are always fresh as is the salsa.  Try the molcahete for a great combination of meats, cactus, green onion and avocado in a hot lava parillada style dish.  One order is enough for two people, just order some extra tortillas.

If you want something simpler get the grilled chicken tacos a la carte.  Great little pieces of juicy grilled chicken in two tortillas.

I have been to at least ten different Mexican restaurants in the Madison area and this one tops them all.
