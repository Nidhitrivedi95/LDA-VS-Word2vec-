fXqlzAM6PTXUGrU4y33LzQ Well, we liked it so much we returned on Saturday evening. I'm hoping that it is rarely used, but from where we sat you could clearly see a kitchen staff person using a dun, dun, dunnnnn... microwave. I guess I am crazy to think there should NOT be microwaves in restaurant kitchens, but alas, I saw it. And they had to correct my meal which came out on a very hot plate that I suspect was in said microwave. I'll be back, but I will request that only traditional cooking methods be used on my food. I'd rather have something luke warm than nuked. Lose the microwave, Juana! You're better than that.
