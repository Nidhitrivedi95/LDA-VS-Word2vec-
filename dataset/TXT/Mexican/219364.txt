rD32POdIhGN9eR8aUxl-3A This location has gone downhill. It used to be a good place to eat but not so anymore. Went in this evening for dinner with family and the employees looked irritated. The soda machine was down again! This is the second time I've been here it's been down. When I asked the cashier about when it will be up again she had attitude and acted like I was accusing her of it being broken. Their customer service needs to up their game or they are going to lose customers. Too many other places in town to eat at.
