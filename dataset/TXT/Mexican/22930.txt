2kfXHEV-bx0nTp0MzLQgSA We went here for dinner a couple months ago and it was good enough that we thought we'd come back and try it for lunch.  BIG mistake!!!!!  Their lunch menu is very limited and when I asked the waiter if I could order something off the regular menu, I was told NO.  The lunch I had didn't even come with rice or beans....what kind of a Mexican restaurant is this???  I got a taco and an enchilada thrown on a plate with nothing else.  The appearance of the food was not appetizing and the taste wasn't much better.  If you're going to come here, make sure it's at dinner time when you have much more to choose from.  The lack of customers at lunchtime explains it all, plus the servers are less than friendly and accommodating.   IMO, Casa Garcia in Denver is a MUCH better choice than this place for lunch and dinner.  We probably won't be back.
