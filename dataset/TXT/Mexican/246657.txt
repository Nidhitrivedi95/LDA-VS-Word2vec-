Tx_cnDj5M0WTzmFB4tfDgg My husband and I decided to try somewhere we had never been and agreed to come here for dinner. What a HUGE mistake. We walked in and were seated in a timely manner. We received our chips and salsa and our menus. Then we waited...and waited...and waited. There were only 2 other customers in the restaurant. Finally the gentleman that seated us saw us looking around for a waitress and came over and kindly took our order. The food was ok...pretty average chimichanga...rice..beans..etc. Nothing special. We were finished eating and yet again sat and waited for a waitress. I finally got up and grabbed a box for our leftovers. A few minutes later a girl came over and my husband handed her his bank card. She came back and said sir...was your card broken? We were appalled to see his bank card cracked into 2 pieces. Are you kidding me? No we didn't hand you a broken card. What a horrible experience. We will NEVER go back. Stay away.
