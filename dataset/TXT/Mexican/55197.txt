9wNvIYUtUkB0B1LDyxapHg First time here and it was amazing! I had the carne asada fries and my daughter had the kids quesadilla.  The food was wonderfully flavorful and even my picky eater declared her food delicious! The sauces in the back of the dining area were yummy, accurately described, and tasted fresh.  Staff was helpful,  polite and quick.  I will be back.
