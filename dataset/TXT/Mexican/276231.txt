xG7BWegIYCo73s4za2MeTA They don't give you much food.. I got breakfast and the $1 flat bread had maybe half an egg and a sprinkle of meat.. I posted a picture.. I also got 2 breakfast burritos and it's all tortilla and their cheese sause I don't think I had any egg.. the only breakfast thing that was at least decent.. was the breakfast crunch wrap.. but the hash brown was undercooked and the sausage was over cooked.. very disappointing breakfast.
