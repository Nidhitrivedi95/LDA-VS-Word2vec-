H-B_JoResY4PyXND1_DQfg Excellent selection of IPAs!  Salsa & guacamole is always fresh!  The spice level varies by the ingredients and whose making it!  Love the wings & the burritos! McKnight road location is my favorite!  The staff is top notch! Super friendly & know their beer!  Sit at the bar or bar area and soak in the atmosphere & their friendly banter.  Love the manager, Shawn!!!
