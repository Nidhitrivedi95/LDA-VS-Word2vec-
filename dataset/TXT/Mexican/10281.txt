_XN-GwzZwAyIqLKJsl2htg I always forget how amazing this place is. It's unique in that it has very two distinct personalities. I will go there with my friends for happy hour and grab a snack, and I've also taken foodie clients there for a business meal. My only warning is that you have to be careful if you were entertaining guests as it can be a bit noisy, crowded, and with often slow service. But this is just because it is a very cool and hip spot... unfortunately, this is the only reason it's getting four and not five stars.

How can you not go wrong with an Asian and Mexican mix of food! I know it sounds strange, but some of the food combinations are simply amazing. For something as simple as guacamole, there is this some of the best that I've had, particularly the pomegranate guacamole option. It may sound a bit strange, but trust me it's a very subtle and unexpected twist on a classic...And the hand fried whole tortillas are extra crunchy and amazing!

We ended up ordering about 10 or 12 entrées to share on my last visit, so I don't want to name them all but the kimchi fried rice, Chilean Seabass, and some of the noodle options are simply outstanding. Of everything I've eaten there, there's not a single thing that I wouldn't order again.

And please don't stop at the food... Be sure to get drinks! The cocktail menu is phenomenal as well. If you happen to be visiting on a hot day, be sure to try the blended mojito. It's one of the most refreshing and delicious drinks I've ever had...just maybe save it for dessert as it is quite sweet. There are a ton of other drinks on the menu that are worth having before you get to that one.
