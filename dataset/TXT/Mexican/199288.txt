PAcD5cYk9yFtgUYvejaVfQ Well I've been here several times it's usually ok and food tasted ok. I happen to find myself in here the other day and had ordered a dell taco plain. Meaning no lettuce no tomato Cheese etc just meat. Well you can't make this stuff up. I got an empty hard shell. No meat nothing. Who orders a shell ? I also ordered one dell taco with cheese only. Guess what I got. A hard shell stuffed with cheese only. No meat ! I don't think whom ever was
Making dine in orders that day didn't understand English enough to make the tacos to order. Needless to say visiting this location going forward is not an option anymore. Just not worth the laughs anymore.
