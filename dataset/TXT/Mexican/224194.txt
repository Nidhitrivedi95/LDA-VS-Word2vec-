RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg pretty good tacos. Not for those who have never been to a Taqueria and I think that's what this places I would have to say the food is really good fresh and hot. It's not your typical Taco Bell. But what happens is the process is much like a conveyor belt or kind a like a chipotle style where you go in order and they ask you what you want and they Kinda speak mostly Spanish but you could just point and Grant and tell her you want this taco or that taco and show them how many by the number of your fingers and they understand. And the tacos, about the size of like your hand. and are filled with mainly just meet I'm no real veggies like a full-blown in a Taco Bell taco that you're used to but they have some side condiments and onions and hot sauce and some peppers they can put in an overall pretty good I had mine on corn tortillas him they also have a gigantic rotisserie with spicy type pork with a pineapple on top that's pretty good I recommend that I think it's called taco Al Pastore. Overall each taco was about two dollars and so an average meal to be about $10-$20 per person. Yeah I would like to go back I think it's a good place to go to if you want that nice quick meal thanks
