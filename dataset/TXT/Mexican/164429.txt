lJh661dhjD5BDz5QrBEUeQ The chicken tacos are awesome! It is tender, pulled chicken in a spicy sauce. Adding sour cream makes a great balance of flavors. Also very good is the ground beef, which is well seasoned and tasty. These alone bring up the rating. The hubby and I have also tried Arizona and Patron burrito, rolled tacos, and chips & salsa...all of which we will not order again. The Arizona had undercooked potatoes, too many onions and was lacking flavor. The Patron was too much meat (ham, bacon, and steak), even too much for my meat-loving husband..needed more textures/taste. The rolled tacos were so dang dry with some sort of unseasoned, sauceless meat inside of a rolled hard shell...no dipping sauce to add moisture and flavor. We had high hopes for the chips and salsa. Ordering it to go, they gave us a mound of chips with their pico on top. We don't mind onions, but  this was overrun with them. It was as though they had chopped up a huge onion and added in a single cherry tomato. No spice or flavor other than onion-tastic. The tacos will keep us coming back. THey are made-to-order and yummy! Food is cheap enough for trial and error . Once you find your go-to item, it is definitely worth checking out this place.Be advised that it feels like it is 500 degrees in there...even when it is cool outside.
