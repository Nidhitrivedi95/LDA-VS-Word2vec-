CLthP1yn32xlBswIbsLIjQ I've ordered from her twice. The first time the delivery was fast..only about 30 minutes, which is convenient because I work off the stirp, BUT THEY FORGET MY CHIPS..I was a little mad but still happy to have my food..even though it's pretty plain. Ordered a second time and AGAIN THEY FORGOT THE CHIPS  and TOOK OVER 90 MINUTES TO DELIVER WHEN I'm ONLY 15 mins tops from the location... Never ordering again. Terrible customer service!!!
