mBzqaX6D4FIbSBbagOLvTw I came here today against my better judgement (bad experience last year) and instantly regretted it! I tried to call in my order for about 15 minutes, but got the busy signal every time. I decided to use the drive thru. The young man working the window asked me two separate times what I had ordered. He kept forgetting. I ordered Hibatchi chicken with mushrooms. They weren't busy, but there was two other families inside ordering. I sat in the drive thru for 22 minutes! I called the restaurant from my vehicle while in the drive thru line just out of curiosity. It didn't surprise me that no phone ever rang inside and yet I got the busy signal. No one was on the phone, which means they had the phone off the hook just to avoid having to take phone orders. That is absolutely ridiculous. Once I finally got my food and got home, I realized that they had given me hibachi chicken/carrots/broccoli. NO MUSHROOMS?!?! This place is SLOWWW, dirty and the guy working tonight honestly seemed like he was on drugs. The worst part about this whole experience? My chicken was not cooked completely! I could have gotten sick had I eaten it. I picked the chicken out and tried to eat the rice and veggies but it, just like my whole experience, was disgusting. I tried to call to speak to someone, but to no surprise got the busy signal. I will not be coming back and I urge anyone thinking about coming here not to.
