VOzk2CKZMG5JeXSTZvIhYA Usually pretty good, but they get lazy sometimes. Bought dinner for my family just to get home and realize our quesadillas and bean and cheese burritos were all under cooked and none of the cheese had been melted and was still cold....I mean it's the 2 easiest things on the menu to cook....get it together dudes. And stop getting all pissed when I ask for extra salsa.
