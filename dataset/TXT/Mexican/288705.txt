yGg7O0ATbMzoxrLvByzp2g Food wasn't fresh at all! seemed like bread for cheese dip was old and hard, drinks I had a lemonade cocktail and wife had daquari (both were way to sweet ! And I'm not picky at all with my food or drinks, main dish Pad Thai was again wayy to sweet and my wife had a burger average at best meat was dry. Overall I've eaten here 3 times and seems like it's all about volume and size service was horrible I actually had to get up and go find our waiter for dessert and the bill. There are much better restaurant in the area and I strongly suggest looking elsewhere.
