SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA This is by far our favorite Mexican restaurant. We have been going there for a few years now and have never had a bad experience.
The food is consistently good, the service is great. Staff is friendly and service is fast and friendly even when they are very busy. (and they can get VERY busy at times)
We love their flaming fajitas (shrimp and/or steak) and the fact that you can choose between rice and beans on the side, or fresh healthy veggies, which are NEVER mushy or overcooked.
Some of our favorites are the Beef Taquitos, the Table Side Guacamole, the Shrimp Ceviche and those wonderful roasted Jalapenos and onions they serve for free when you first sit down. 
Portions are big, we always end up eating too much, but food is just so good you can't help but stuff your face.
Margaritas are fantastic too. 
The place is family friendly, good prices for what you get, great for dining with your kids.
