V2yFOyq-4cj7dUvEXyMiGQ I don't know why, but this Filiberto's is significantly more expensive than other burrito places.   $6 for a country burrito!!!  Also, they let you know your food is ready by calling a number.   Problem is you have no idea what your order number is.   It is not listed anywhere on the receipt you are given.  First time and last time for this location.    No value here and poor execution.
