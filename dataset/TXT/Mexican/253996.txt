V0GryzKJfygQOK-n8Hw5Mw Having just moved from San Diego I have been hugely dissapointed in the quality of Mexican food here in the AZ without having a 30 min drive... Now that I moved from Glendale to Peoria I sorely miss Tacos Mich, seriously one of my fave spots and one of the few places I would actually take a trip to. Carne Asada/Al Pastor/Grilled Chx are awesome. I have never had issues with service there but then its counter service and I order straight off the menu. HUGE bonus grilled onions and grilled Jalapenos to bring home with ya, and the salsas are legit...
