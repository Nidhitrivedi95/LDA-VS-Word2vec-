jWpTckAGWMWEffl2D7NhCA This was my very first visit ever, boy was it delicious! I got enchiladas and hot carrots, I can't even remember the last time I was able to order hot carrots!! I took it to go because frankly I was tired and wanted to take my shoes off, but had I stayed, I'd have been super pleased with my visit. The restaurant was very clean. The staff was friendly and attentive. I'll not only recommend, but I'll be back with friends!
