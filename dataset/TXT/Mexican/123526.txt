HkbNItNrnXlNo59M0YyoMg Service by Rachel S was horrible. Have been here a few times. Have always enjoyed the food and service except for yesterday. We met up with some friend's, there were 7 of us. We had seperate checks for everyone but was charged a 18% gratuity. I'm assuming for a big party. Which makes no sense as we all paid seperate. Anyways that's not really the issue. Our server, Rachel S. Was horrible. Never checked on us, never asked for drink refills. We were all drinking beer and had plans on hanging out but our server was horrible and we got tired of not having our drinks refilled so we cashed out and went to the handlebar down the street and drank. The whole time we were there she was on her phone texting. I have no problem paying a pre calculated gratuity if you get good service. I figure she didn't care about us because she knew she was getting 18% off of each tab...so off  our table she got close to $30 which is crap because she was horrible. Being a server myself I pay close attention to this because I bust my ass for my tips and to see someone give customers crappy service and pocket tips that the customer had no option in paying is ridiculous.  I was not even in the mood to argue the gratuity,  I will just not go back. Very disappointing.
