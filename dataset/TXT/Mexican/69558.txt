The tab came in the black carrier with the itemized bill, totaling $74 for our drinks, food and tax. I handed him the credit card. When I went to sign and add in tip, our bill increased to over $96. Noticing a $25 increase, I asked to see the itemized bill again. 

He said he double charged us for our salads; however, it is rare an establishment adds items after a bill is established, when nothing else is ordered and he fail to produce a itemized check when it came time to sign. In addition, he did not apologize for the mistake. 

The idea of a server taking advantage of the diner is appalling. I do not see myself or any of the folks traveling with me returning to this restaurant due to the dishonest service.
