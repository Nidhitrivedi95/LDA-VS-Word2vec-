FGaaHr_krwaPGlD0mHPe4Q This place has both great food and outstanding customer service! The food doesn't take long to hit your table like some Mexican food places. 

Our waitress was spot on! She was friendly and attentive just at the right times. 

The Spanish rice is authentic and full of flavor! I'm very satisfied with my Mexican food experience at Mattas! Thanks guys, keep it up.
