1JF9TbJ2d5hH8xsQvvklHg Irma's Kitchen deserves more awareness and praise. Each person that walks into this small restaurant is greeted and treated with nothing more but sincere kindness. This place is very flexible in modifying the dining options offered to fit any person's needs or interests. The breakfast was good, the service was great, and it was REALLY cheap! Really hope sometime in the future they expand to a bigger location because they will most likely need it.
