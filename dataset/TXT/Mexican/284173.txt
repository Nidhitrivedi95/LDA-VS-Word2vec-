xZhNZb01n9b4e2X7bZdoVQ Stopped in for a chicken burro enchilada style, since this is on my way home from work.  My favorite place for these is Manuel's on Indian School, just didn't want to drive that far.

Service was fine, but burro was watery and not nearly as tasty as Manuel's.  Will look for another place along the Central corridor.

Any suggestions?
