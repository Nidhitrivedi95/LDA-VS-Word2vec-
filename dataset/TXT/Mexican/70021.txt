bU9RYLrF77bxO2pSA0Ba7Q This seems very new! (Noted: now open sign outside haha) 
This location of chipotle did not disappoint. We were on our way to Hoover dam when we realized that our navigation was taking a detour. It worked in our favor as we ended up finding this. 
The place is fresh and full of natural light. There wasn't a line so we all go our burrito bowls very quickly. All of their ingredients were super fresh and par with chipotle standards. It was also very clean! We did not have to look at multiple tables to find one that was acceptable. I give this place 2 thumbs up and hope that it continues the good work!
