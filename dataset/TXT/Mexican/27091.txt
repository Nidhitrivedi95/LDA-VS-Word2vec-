3CI95LMvt4u1xqEWq6CbnQ I came here because they offer HALAL authentic Mexican food which is rare in the GTA and area. (I'm not talkin tacos n burritos).
Be aware they also have a few dishes with pork such as the pre-prepared empanadas (has chorizo which is pork sausage).

They said that their chicken and beef has been halal for many many years due to their customer base.
They also had virgin cocktails.

Their menu includes some of the most common Mexican dishes such as chimichangas, enchiladas, fajitas, chicken with mole sauce, and taquitos.

The restaurant is relatively small and decorated with basic Mexican decor.  The service was great and fast. 
The food was good and reasonably priced.

There is free parking at the back which is nice.

I would recommend this place and I would return again.
