VjjUTy8dkHAW2-YrMQDg9w This "dive" has only been open a few weeks. The inside could use a face lift but that's not really why we are there. Although we had to wait a few minutes to be seated, the server was friendly and happy to see us. Most of the tables needed to be cleared off, from what looked like a "rush" that had occurred. On the table there was at least eight different types of salsa in bottles. We were also given their salsa in a bowl served with tostada shells, which by the way, were tasty. The orchata was most satisfying and the jamaica was also good. I ordered the medium size shrimp cocktail, and it was more than I needed. Fresh shrimp and chopped fresh onions and cucumber. Very good!
My husband had the spicy shrimp meal that came with rice and a salad. All very delicious and so different.  Beer is not sold; you bring your own.
