hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg Ok - hands down the best old fashioned i've ever had. Fantastic service. Staff was so friendly. No pretenses. Just passionate about food. Sat at the bar. Had the scallops and char. Just wonderful. Had the poutine because it just seemed like we should. Wish we were here longer just to go back again!  Will be a must on any trip to Montreal. Wonderful!
