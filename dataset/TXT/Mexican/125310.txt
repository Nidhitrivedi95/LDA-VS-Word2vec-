hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg CARLOS! WORST BARTENDER EVER!!!!!!! If you sit at the bar with this guy you are a HUGE inconvenience for him! With only 2 other people sitting at the bar it will still take him 5 minutes to even acknowledge you! You have to get up numerous times and actually go to him if you need anything! We have unfortunately dealt with this same bartender twice now and each visit was sadly the same. We have always continued coming back because they do have decent food and we love the bartenders Edward and Enrique. But now the last few times it's been this Carlos guy and we will no longer come back. Management might want to do something before he runs all your customers away!
