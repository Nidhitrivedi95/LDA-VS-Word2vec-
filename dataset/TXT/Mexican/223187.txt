RUxAdd3mmNkejoTAX2YIDw Fantastic Mexican food in a great environment! I have been back here several times and it's quite a ways out of my way just for the food. My favorite is their Chicken Chimichanga.

The restaurant itself is full of bright vibrant colors, dim lighting hand-carved booths and tables. When it's busy it does get a little loud but it just adds to the environment for me.
