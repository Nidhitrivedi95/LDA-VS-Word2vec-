ydqbNz2sHENV9XOElwyAYA We have been coming here since they opened years ago but never posted a review so this is long overdue. We come as often as we can with friends for Taco Tuesday and occasional weekend visits. Never a bad meal here, have had almost everything on the menu. Not to fond of traditional Mexican fare so their New Mexican style is what I like.  Michael the owner always stops by our table for a chat and makes us feel welcome and part of the family. Bartender Rob knows how to make our drinks perfectly the way we like. Blue Adobe has become our favorite neighborhood place and we bring all of our out of town visitors there to their delight.
