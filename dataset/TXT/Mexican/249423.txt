UGiMMw54qYxac0eE_cBbaA We came in for dinner with two people in wheel chairs. The female server yelled at us, loud enough for half of the place to hear, that she didn't have any room for wheel chairs. She then walked off.  Would have been a lot more professional if she had quietly explained what our seating options were for disabled persons. It was actually very embarrassing and several other people eating there got up from their tables and offered to make room for us. We ended up having to store the wheelchairs outside of the restaurant. Prices were expensive which we expected for the airport location but the portions small. The only vegetarian option for one person in our party was a chicken salad minus the chicken. Our server (the same one who had yelled at us) informed us that they can serve it without the chicken but it would cost the same price. Too afraid of her disposition to ask for her to if we could have it as a side dish for someone else. We have had breakfast here in the past which seemed pretty good.
