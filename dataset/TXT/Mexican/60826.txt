aP2Ma-Wx2lydppntCGhNSg Mexican food was very very good. The atmosphere is really nice. They have a wonderful place to sit outside with misters Great place for happy hour and meeting up with friends. We have a burrito it was covered in cheese. Ask them what's the favorite item on the menu and it was it. It was made with chicken and was wonderful! So glad to finally found a good Mexican restaurant. I am from Texas and we have many.
