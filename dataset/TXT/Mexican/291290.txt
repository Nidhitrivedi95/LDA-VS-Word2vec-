YSYDJTCt5kzY2kKnLNGRiA I've been here several times.  It's got a great vibe and atmosphere that keeps me coming back.  The food is pretty tasty as well.  This is not traditional Mexican food- it's Americanized so if you want "authentic" Mexican food go someplace else, Sol is not perfect, they definitely have plates that are stronger than others, and ones that could probably be removed, but overall, it's got a strong selection of good choices.  

For appetizers, I recommend the chorizo queso, but ask for extra tostada chips to eat it with (they are their substitution for tortilla chips you normally receive at mexican restaurants) instead of the included corn tortillas.  Avoid the calamari and goat cheese apps... they are not worth it. Calamari is more like a fish stick than the typical rings commonly served.  Different- yes.  Better- no. 

For entrees, any of the tacos will serve you well.  They haven't really disappointed me yet and although they are a bit on the expensive side, hey, it's N. Scottsdale, rent isn't cheap here.  Vampiro is a great one, so is El Jefe (shrimp and filet Mignon) I've also tried their chili relleno and I'd describe it as a "healthy" version of the normally deep-fried mexican variant.  It's stuffed with shrimp, rice, and veggies.  Tasty, and it'll certainly fill you up.  I believe it's baked. 

Wait staff has always been pleasant; I dont recall any instances where they were rude to me or my guests.  I have sat and been served at the bar, on the patio, and inside the dining room.  When it gets busy, there is a little more time in-between check-ups on the table by the waiters, but that is not unreasonable.  I've flagged down a manager before when the waiter's time expired in my mind and was accommodated without hesitation or attitude.

I plan to keep coming back.
