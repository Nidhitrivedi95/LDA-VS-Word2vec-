PQWE8a6Opjiuzt7DaX2R6Q Came to blue agave for dinner last night with my wife. The food was very tasty, I ordered a carne asada burrito with red enchilada sauce, my wife ordered a taco salad and a margarita, I ordered a blue moon.it took about 30 min to get our food but it was worth the wait, very generous portions so make sure to come with an appetite. The margarita was perfect and the waitress was very friendly and professional.
