S599hCA4kJJO3_b6SRFKoA My wife and I have eaten here since it opened and it has never been on point.  It hasn't been our #1 Mexican restaurant in quite a while.  The consistency is not there.  The rewards program is one of the worst that exist.  It's almost insulting. Mexican food doesn't cost much to make and their pricing is on the high side.  We've traveled farther distances for much better quality at a more reasonable price.  Out of all the Michoacan restaurants, the one on D.I. & Eastern or Craig & I-15 are more consistent and not disappointing.
