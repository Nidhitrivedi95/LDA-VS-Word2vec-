6lCFq6RQxctSW37yNYZ5wg I stopped here for happy hour last night. The drink and food deals were good ($1 off beer, wine, cocktails and appetizers), and the bartender, Rick, was super nice and made some great drinks. The food was just OK. I ordered chicken tortilla soup, and they weren't stingy with the chicken, but the chicken was overcooked. I also had the elote, and again, it was OK. It's hard to screw up corn with mayo and spices. The best part of the place is the decor (gas pumps behind the bar, chandeliers made from hubcaps, pesos in the bar), with Rick's service being a close second. I wouldn't come back for the food, though.
