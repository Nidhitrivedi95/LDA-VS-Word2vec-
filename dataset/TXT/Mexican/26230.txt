The space is really cool and unique, I'll give them that. The food, however, was subpar. The guacamole was OK and the queso dip was fine. We each ordered 3 different flavored tacos and agreed that across the board the meat in all of them was dry and they all were missing something -- acidity or more sauce or something. 
The service, too, was lacking. There were only a handful of us in the restaurant and yet it seemed to to ages to get our food. Also we kept having to ask for refills on our water. 
I hope they improve this place. It has potential. Until they do I won't be recommending it to anyone.
