x7RRLRKyKdME9X3GuR5-5w Finally tried the Macayo's in my area and it didn't disappoint!  We usually go to the one off 59th and Bell, but I'm glad we tried this one. 

We stopped in at about 4:30pm. It wasn't crowded at all, which is nice. We were seated right away by a very pleasant hostess. Our server (so sad that I forget his name!) was super nice and very attentive! 

Our food arrived quickly and it was great, as always. I tried one of the new items on the menu (Diablo Steak). It was a delicious steak with a yummy salsa/chipotle type topping. It came with poblano mashed potatoes (so good!) and cheesy black beans.  I would definitely order it again! We had a coupon for a bogo entree, so we only ended up paying 20 something for both of our meals.

Great job, Macayo's!
