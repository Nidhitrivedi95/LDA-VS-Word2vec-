vNwj8u1KbnKPQFMTd3TDWw My daughter & I decided to go here (our 1st time) yesterday after our power went out on the hottest day of summer (114 degrees!) due to some downed power lines. SRP said it could possibly take 2 hours to repair & with our dinner not quite done cooking on the stove, we did not want to stay in the already hot house while the power was off.  As we skirted out the door, the power came back on but we decided to go anyway.  As we parked the car I realized I had forgotten something I wanted to bring to the restaurant.  So strike 2 for me....  I wondered what could happen in the restaurant that would be strike 3.  Happily... NOTHING!

We were greeted promptly at the entrance & seated right away.  There were a few other guests at other tables but soon after we were seated many people started showing up for dinner as well.  Our waitress, Carol, came over pretty quickly & asked how we were.  Without hesitation, I said, "Flustered!"  She asked why so I explained what led to that feeling.  Well, Carol was sweet & attentive & gave us a nice & very unexpected surprise which really made my night.  We both had the nightly special: cheese enchilada, beef taco with rice & beans all for $7.95 each, which I thought was a great price.  We both cleaned our plates & then decided to order the apple chimichanga for dessert.  Out came a huge plate with 2 chimichangas filled with big slices of apples, & 2 scoops of ice cream. Yum!

The food was good & filling & the prices of the other menu items seemed comparable to other restaurants.  But what made it a really good night & got me over my flustered feeling was how friendly & caring Carol was.

Thanks Carol!  We'll be back!
