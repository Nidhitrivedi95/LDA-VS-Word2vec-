HWl2EbZhkhAkFgqt44yUkA This review takes into account the fact that I had a $24 Groupon for $40 worth of food. Otherwise, the meals are WAY too expensive for what you get. 

Both of our meals were fairly good. I got the Chicken Quesadilla ($17), which featured actual cheese that was filled all the way to the edges of the tortilla--unlike some places where you're eating JUST tortilla until you get to the middle. The chicken was a little dry, but not enough to ruin the meal.

My fiancee ordered the beef nachos ($19), which came with REAL cheese, instead of nasty cheese-like sauce. These were impressive, considering this was a gimmicky-type of restaurant. By the time she (with my help) got down to the bottom of the plate, there was plenty of cheese and meat leftover. We didn't have to eat a bunch of plain chips with nothing on them. The nachos were also layered with refried beans, which added a nice touch.

Food-wise, the guacamole was the low point. It was way too oniony and relied on that for its taste.

The atmosphere is pretty cool, so you have to give it points for that, but I don't think I'd come back without a Groupon.

The food isn't terrible, but just doesn't live up to the price tag. In fact, I'm not sure anyone's nachos or quesadillas would. If you're going to dine here, make sure you find a deal online, otherwise you're overpaying.
