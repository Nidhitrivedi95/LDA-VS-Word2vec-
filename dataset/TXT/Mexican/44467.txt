7m1Oa1VYV98UUuo_6i0EZg AMAZING hole in the wall! I got the pulled pork, which itself was delicious but the toasted 9 grain bread really made the sandwich perfect. And the prices were more than reasonable, especially with how much food you get, they really don't skimp. My friend got the chicken club which was definitely a step above for such a classic sandwich. Definitely going back to try their sides next time!
