DyOzNIeXUksPNLXYHnB-oQ Sabor: you have my heart. 

I've never had a disappointing bite here. If you're a first timer, you can't go wrong with the basics: chips/nachos, tacos (shredded chicken is my favorite), and you gotta try the elote loco. 

Empanadas and burritos are also delicious, and their lighter menu is good as well. They also sell local beer and I've heard their margaritas are amazing as well. On top of that, their price point...!! Good for the soul, stomach, and wallet.
