XfUoM-27iPHkbewPXepmFQ Gotta love El Pollo Loco! The food is really good (I especially love the quesadillas) and the girls taking my order all seemed nice, although I could tell that maybe they were tired (possibly of doing the same thing over and over again). Despite the hefty price for a fast food item, I enjoyed my chicken avocado quesadilla and will be back to this location. 

4 stars for the overall atmosphere -- I felt welcome, but more of a forced welcome than a genuine one.
