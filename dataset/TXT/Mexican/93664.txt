e4NQLZynhSmvwl38hC4m-A Authentic Tacos 100% wonderful flavors!! Favorite is tacos de Birria so bomb! Fresh ingredients always, only down side gets too packed and hard to find seats but service is quick and friendly, also prices went way up use to be 1.69 for taco now it's like 2 something , I still go though I'm willing to pay extra!!
