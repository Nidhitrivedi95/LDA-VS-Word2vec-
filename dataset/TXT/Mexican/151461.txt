JTstxpVRd_uSD3hCxzrEvw I live close and have been half a dozen times. The food is good, but I'd compare it to any neighborhood Mexican place. The staff is always friendly and I've never seen it very busy so the wait staff stay on top of things. Good soft tacos (basic beef, cheese, lettuce), rice and beans are good but nothing special. I do notice you get shredded cheese not unlike what you'd get at giant eagle, I would prefer freshly shredded authentic white queso or what's the point? I can make tacos with "Mexican blend shredded cheese" and ice burg lettuce at home. One thing I will say is that the salsa is very good and homemade, spicy enough and roasted tomato flavor! I will continue to go for fast, cheap mexican but it's not one of the best meals I've had.
