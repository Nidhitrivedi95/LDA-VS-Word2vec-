fdS9moyk-R84-DgY5xrCRg After my third visit I'm comfortable with awarding a five star review. 

Dinner consisted of Mahi Mahi tacos, grilled chicken nachos, and a burrito. Everything was nothing short of outstanding.

Note: Initially I believed the ordering process to be a bit tedious but this appears to have worked itself out.
