IiTLzksQAv9U8CW3s0bmlg My husband and I have started coming here on the weekend for some delicious Mexican food! We have only been a few times but love the food! We think it's fairly priced and the portions aren't SUPER huge. The staff is super friendly and helpful, the restaurant is kept very clean, and there is plenty of seating without feeling crowded. They have the soda machine that has a tremendous number of flavors as well, which is always a great find! My personal favorite menu item is the chimichangos appetizer!!!
