3SLDrXzPmKF0iCY8WriLsA I do not suggest you go here. Today I went, wanting chicken tacos, and then being told that it would be about 20 minutes on the chicken. So I decided to go with something  easier, I got breakfast burrito. And I had to wait 15 minutes for that. Why? It's just a couple of eggs you had to make! My best friend that I had gone with, was nearly done with eating her dinner, when they just began making mine.  When I asked what took so long, I was told, "you're getting your order cooked fresh ma'am". 
I have had fresh cooked food and a lot faster time than this. I could've went home make eggs myself, and make the tortillas myself faster. The service was absolutely horrible, and the attitude of the workers, was not any better. Burrito, not nearly worth waiting 15 minutes for, nor paying for at all. I could've gone to any other restaurant, and gotten in my entire meal before it took them to make my burrito..I only gave this place one star, because that's the lowest you can give.
