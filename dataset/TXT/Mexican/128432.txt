i-LDatuEXFN3EDZK1sgllQ We came for dinner on a Saturday about 7:00 PM and pretty much had the place to ourselves.
They were setting up the sound system for the night so maybe the party starts later in the evening at Aroma? I know they have dancers on some days.

I came for the food, not the music, but it was actually pretty nice to watch hispanic music videos and enjoy my authentic Spanish cuisine.

The Empanadas Colombianas were amazing, Steak Empanadas with a chipotle aioli and aji dipping sauce. (I could eat these all day long)
The Paella Valenciana is delicious!!! Shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, chicken, chorizo, green peas, green beans, mushrooms, zucchini and squash. Flavor is out of this world!!!! (the left overs made for the most amazing breakfast the next day)
The Bandeja Palsa was also fabulous. Steak, pork belly, chorizo, rice, beans, fried plantain, fried egg and avocado. The steak was flavored so perfectly, not over cooked, and tender. Pork Belly and Chorizo were good too, but the star of the plate amid all of that meat,  was the rice and beans........ I couldn't get enough of it. 
Loved! Loved! Loved! I will be back soon!
