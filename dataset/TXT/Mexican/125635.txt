HTlsBAd9j1wlWDHxnYczBw We ended up in the neighborhood on a weekday (lunch time) and we stopped by La Fonda del Sol.
We went for the buffet, and what a nice surprise!

They had me at 'menudo and cocido' : ) I must not be very picky for menudo anymore, I thought the menudo and the buffet itself were pretty decent. There are not many options for dishes but they had a very good selection, and options for many ways of eating. I think vegetarians can enjoy rice, beans, chile relleno and enchiladas. They had chicken and beef fajita (hubby liked the chicken better, said beef was a little tough, but you would not expect the best meat on a reasonably priced buffet...). They also had shredded meat and ground beef. Plus some chicken in red chile sauce that was very good too.
I was not so fond of the chips this time, I remember them lighter and these ones were more like 'tostitos'...
Service was nice and friendly, I did not get the name of the young lady that served us.
Overall, great experience and hope to be back for my 'menudo fix'

Menudo - very good ratio of meat to hominy.
Cocido, big chunks of meat, too lean for my taste, but at least good amount of meat.
