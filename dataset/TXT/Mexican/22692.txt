2j78b8m1w4Sr2GVGCzFBtQ Although the food is wonderful the wait time was unbelievable. We ordered our food at 12:10 and it is still not here 50 minutes later. 

It would be understandable if we ordered something complicated but we ordered tacos. Nothing special, right off the menu tacos. Many tables have come and gone and our food has not been brought and our cheese dip is now cold. I am extremely disappointed and will not be returning for lunch moving forward.

Edit to my review: our drinks were comped and I appreciate that gesture. I would highly suggest either calling ahead with your order or going for dinner if you plan to go for Friday at lunch.
