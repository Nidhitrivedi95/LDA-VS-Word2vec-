4OUGSeQeASZGn9nSb8Ialg Oh dear...

The only reason this place has any stars is because the staff is STELLAR.

Food is okay. There is no variety, nothing special.
Everything is clean.
Atmosphere would be AWESOME if this town had any population.

And the staff is wonderful.

But there's no one here... How is this place still open?
I guess it's a good place to get weird!
