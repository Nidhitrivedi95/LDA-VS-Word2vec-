mUAEn4Ud0PN-Dv446vhfSg We really wanted to like this place. This place fits the definition of over rated! There wasn't anything wrong necessarily, but nothing of our experience was worthy of a 5 Star review. 
It looks and feels like a standard

The food was ok. We ordered the carne asada tacos, beef rolled tacos, and a quesadilla. Everything was average or a little better maybe. 

I really am not trying to say anything negative about the place. I would eat there again. It just would have to be someone else's idea!
All in all, with so many great mexican food options in the valley, Humberto's needs to step it up if they want to stick around! I wish them well.
