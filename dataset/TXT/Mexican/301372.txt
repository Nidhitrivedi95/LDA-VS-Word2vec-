Here is where I celebrated my Cinco.  With 5 rolled tacos, how could you go wrong?  The 5 beauties were lined up in a row with quacamole, cheese and shredded lettuce all plopped on top, it was delish!

Not that any of these place  can boast cleanliness, neither can this place BUT- you get it to go.  Eat it at home and you are A-OK.
