gIPrEKqnJwaAH0ZyvnQHeg I came here for dinner with my husband. We received a coupon in the mail so we decided to try it out.

The salsa bar is a very nice touch. I would say their medium is actually more of a mild, though. The bean dip is delicious.

I ordered the two item combo plate. I got a shredded beef taco and a pork tamale. The tamale was too salty/hard for my taste. The taco was much more tolerable.

My husband ordered a two item combo plate with a shredded beef burrito and shredded beef enchilada. He preferred the burrito over the enchilada.

Both our plates came with rice and beans. Both the black and refried beans were decent. I'd give the beans a 7/10, and the rice a 6/10. As someone who grew up eating homemade Mexican food, my expectations are a bit high.

That being said, the service was quick and attentive, and the presentation was great. I would be willing to come back and try something else from the menu.
