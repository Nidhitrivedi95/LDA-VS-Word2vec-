Lu8ueuI4LF5i6_km0ip0xw First visit on 12/4/17 to new Cafe Rio was disappointing. Ordered Enchilada plate to go, when l got order home, it was cold and watery. Chips were bland and unsalted. Would not eat in at establishment. Even though it was about 7 P M when l went in to pick up order, long line of customers waiting to place eat in order but no one seated to be served their order. Appears crew running way behind.
