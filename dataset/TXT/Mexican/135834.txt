INzLc1Y0JNQzIHjPH2Nbeg Yeah,  so this place is new and has a lot of potential.  The inside is really nice,  plus it has an outdoor seating area; great for the cooler months.  They serve beer,  which is a plus, though I didn't have any.  It did look like a good selection though. 

The food.  Well maybe it was what I ordered.  I ordered the taco plate (two tacos of my choice and two sides).  I chose to have a shrimp taco and shredded chicken taco,  both with corn tortillas. A side of the cilantro-lime rice and black beans.  Unfortunately,  this was about one step better than Cafe Rio and for those that follow me,  you know I hate Cafe Rio.  Not a good first showing. 


The staff, on the other had, is great. Super friendly and helpful,  you can tell the really enjoy their jobs. 

I'm not sure if I will try it again. It's a challenge to get to. The parking lot is impossible and Rainbow is alway busy.  Give it a try,  let me know what you think. 

Cheers.
