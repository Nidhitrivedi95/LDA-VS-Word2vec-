jAsvKe4-SteA-ZgyfVPoTQ If you're hungry for tradition, I wouldn't go here. 
While this location was the first one in Phoenix, I think the food has gone downhill. I'd rather go to Carlos any day than have dinner at Macayo's. 
The food is just okay. The chips are just okay. The salsa is just okay.
Nothing stands out as being really good, except maybe the margaritas.
If you purchase a Senor Bob or Cha Cha mug, you can get discount margaritas with every visit. But that means you actually have to tote a Mexican man or woman shaped mug back with you each time you eat a meal here.
My mom actually has both Senor Bob and Cha Cha.... 
*sigh*
I prefer to just to buy a margarita any time I'm here and they're pretty good. I like the frozen strawberry and the classic rocks/salt marg. 
If you're looking for a fun after work happy hour spot, the bar area of Macayo's is freaking hoppin.'  It's so busy that it can be a little tough to even find a parking spot.  I think they have a little buffet and drink specials during happy hour. And as it gets later on Friday evenings, the place almost turns into a little club. People start dancing and the music blares.
If you decide to go, just look for the Mayan temple look alike on Central.
