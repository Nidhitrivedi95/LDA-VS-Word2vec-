42TGx8KatGNPCi7rwOzazg We found the food at Verde to be very good, as we were looking for something outside of the traditional Mexican food experience. We found the service to be above average and each item we ordered was delicious. I have to concur with previous reviewers that the prices are a bit high to make this a place I would go to regularly, though I would consider it if they had a more inexpensive special.
