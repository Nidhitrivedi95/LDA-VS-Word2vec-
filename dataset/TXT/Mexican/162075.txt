l1GJnB9TJgGgEeI4at1M0A A real 5 star yelp restaurant.  We were somewhat skeptical before visiting this Mexican restaurant.  We tried fish/shrimp tacos and taco salad ono our first visit.  Wow, those are fresh and delicious.  This is the best CP value Mexican restaurant we ever visited. will come back again for sure.
