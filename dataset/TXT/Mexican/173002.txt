MesBAxNk_M7ISbBmVDiiWQ In all honesty I was a bit skeptical of this place when I saw it was going to be a Spanish restaurant. We have quite a few (really) good Spanish restaurants on the west side and wasn't sure it would find enough of a niche to stand out. Well Yelpers, I was wrong. This place is flat out delicious. I've had a jalapeño margarita (really good) and the shredded beef arepa (they call it an arepita) which is absolutely fantastic. The restaurant probably only sits about 60-70 people including the bar. I've been a couple times now and they seem to always have atleast 3 people working the floor which was plenty. The servers are very personable and quick. Take it from me, a former skeptic, try this place out.
