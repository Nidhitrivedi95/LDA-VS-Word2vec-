I'm never coming back. The food is good but not great. Enchilada nachos green sauce was incredibly bland might as well not have been on it. Huge selection of very interesting beer and an unbelievable selection of margaritas. Prolly best to go for drinks during happy hour and who cares about the food kinda thing. But face it... This is Vegas and there is a very long list of much better food and environment than here.
