We ate almost all of them.  We ordered from the lunch menu which is affordable.  The chile verde is some of the best I have ever tried.  Tender and flavorful.  The taco salad was also good.  Portions were more than adequate especially after eating a whole bowl of chips.

Service was very good.  The waitress was very helpful and had good suggestions.  We were a little in a hurry and she was attentive and got us served quickly.  We didn't lack for anything. We sent with a restaurant dot com coupon for lunch and it was accepted without issue.  I see that they have coupons on Yelp which I might buy because I will be back here again.
