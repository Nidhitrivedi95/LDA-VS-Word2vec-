MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA I love the tacos here! With all of the great Mexican restaraunts to choose from in the city, Grand Electric is surely my favourite. The tuna ceviche is top notch, and the fish tacos have the perfect combination of flavours. I love that they are always playing old-school rap, and the bourbon list and cocktails are awesome. Only drawback is that on the weekends there is a bit of a wait, and it's too loud for my parents- but otherwise 5/5.
