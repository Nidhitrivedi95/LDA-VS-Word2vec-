Q28MO9hEMyG0xrAnOF-dSw Loved the comedy show at Howard's new location.  I was fine with the old location but I feel this place will draw some great talent.  Saw Joe Matarese this weekend and he was fabulous.  It was a full house so I suggest getting there early to get seated and get your food and drink order in.  Howard is so funny.  Please start doing a podcast Howard.  It would be a great addition to your comedy club.  I listen to Fixing Joe, Nick DiPaola and Marc Maron.  I can definitely make room on my playlist for The Howard Hughes Show.  Thanks for a wonderful evening!
