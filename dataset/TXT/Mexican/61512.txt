After hearing friends rave about this restaurant, we decided to give it a try. It's a little hard to locate because there is no sign, but worth the search. 

We took a risk and had the torta ahogada. It was worth it. My boyfriend and I shared that torta and some tacos and were stuffed. The horchata was gritty :( but it could have been because we were there later in the night.
