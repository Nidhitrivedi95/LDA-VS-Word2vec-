1dI4oRq8wQrMs15nnj9TLA Despite my disastrous experience last time, I knew I'd be returning to Smoke's Burritorie when they added "wacky burritos" to their menu - including chicken and waffles and pad thai. I opted for the latter and waited a few minutes while the sole employee prepared my burrito. (Like last time, the joint was absolutely empty.)

Another primary reason I decided to come back was the much ballyhooed sauce bar, which is supposed to contain 20 different sauces ranging from coconut curry to mango pineapple. When I arrived, though, I noticed that there were only five sauces up for offer. Fine, I thought. Five is better than nothing. I went to try a couple of them and they were empty. They were *all* empty. Really, Smoke's? Really??

Anyway, the burrito. It was handed to me fairly quickly and I excitedly took it back to my table. My excitement evaporated after the first bite. Imagine the absolute worst pad thai you've ever eaten and then imagine it crammed into a soggy burrito. The predominant taste was pure sweetness, with the occasional bite of cilantro. And there wasn't even a hint of heat present. I wanted to add hot sauce, but the sauce bar was (obviously) not an option and the dude who made my food disappeared into the back the second he finished making my food.

What a complete trainwreck this place is. The mere fact that it's still open despite other, better options in the neighborhood is absolutely mind-boggling.
