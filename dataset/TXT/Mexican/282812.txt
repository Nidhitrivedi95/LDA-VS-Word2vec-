XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Given the ambience and very expensive dinner my burger should have been better.

I expected a mouth watering bloody and juicy med- rare and got a med- well hockey puck. They corrected but I fully expect to get the burger the right way at a Bobby Flay owned restaurant.

I am not sure I would go back based on my experience which is sad given I truly appreciate Mr. Flay's show's and skills.

good eating
