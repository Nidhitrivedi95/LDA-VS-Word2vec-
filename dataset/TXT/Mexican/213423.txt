Friendly service paired with a world class menu made for a unique dining experience. Having spent two years in Italy, I was in search of some quality pasta. The VUE's pasta Diablo exceeded all my expectations. Expertly prepared with a delightfully spicy sauce, this dish was the best pasta I've had since leaving Florence.
The restaurant comes with a fully service bar and they were happy to prepare an expertly crafted Gin and tonic for a warm Arizona fall day. If ever you find yourself in east Mesa, stop by the VUE at Augusta Ranch and be pleasantly surprised by a delicious menu and superb service!
