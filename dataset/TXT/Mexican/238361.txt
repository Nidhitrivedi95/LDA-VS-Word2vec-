SZpzMUdhh1xu2qlegzSyLg This place serves decent Tex-Mex food. 

I've been here twice now, once for the enchiladas and once for the chimichangas. While both were good, I apparently have yet to try their most popular menu items - the burritos, fish tacos, and Texas cocktails. 

The prices here are quite cheap, with most Tex-Mex dishes coming out to $9-12. My order came with rice, refried beans, sour cream, and a tomato. These extras were very generic and quite bland, especially the rice. The enchiladas and chimichangas themselves, though, were very good. 

After hearing that I haven't even had the best of what they have to offer, I guess I'll have to go back.
