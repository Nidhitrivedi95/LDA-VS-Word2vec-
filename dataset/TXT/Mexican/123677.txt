I've had the tacos ($2 each), the burrito ($6), and their special kimchi tacos ($5) on three different visits now. Each one I had made with Korean BBQ Beef, because well that's why I would go there in the first place. 

My mom is Korean and I've had my share of bulgolgi, kalbi, and all the other good Korean eats that both she and her family make. The bulgolgi (I assume) that goes into these dishes is tender, juicy, and filled with that distinctive Korean BBQ flavor no other words can be used to match.

The mix with mexican food sounded awful at first quite frankly, but after my first bite I was hooked. Who knew bulgolgi went so well with avocados and sour cream?! 

Another great bonus is that you get sweet potato chips with your meal. Which frankly are better than any other sweet potato chip I've had in this town.

Definitely give this place a try, at least for a taco. You won't regret it.
