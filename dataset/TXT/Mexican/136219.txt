iOt7ebp4Zy-5YUjHL1rbmQ We love both locations, so glad it's closer to us and can't wait for that drive through to open!!! 
We are huge fans of the chicken and stake tacos. We also love the crazy potato! 
This is our first go to for friends and family visiting! 
Love the new places location, it's large and lots more room to sit. The new decor is awesome! Super friendly service every time, and fast!
