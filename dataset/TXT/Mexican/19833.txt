1ZgqJjtb91E9tOKhKrzsuw Hacienda's is a treat and I am happy to give it 4 stars.  Angel the bar tender is awesome, the happy hour is great and the staff is friendly.  Our last few visits have really been a pleasure and I am a big fan of the Mexican Caesar salad they offer.  A nice family feeling restaurant in a great North Scottsdale location.
