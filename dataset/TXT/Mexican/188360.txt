o6Yor6ofIw2TqM3mN28Kzg I'm lucky that this place is so close to my work. I love heading there for lunch or even if I need a snack during the day. 

Every time I go in there I always get the transitional soft shell taco's in beef or chicken. I'm convinced they are the best. When they give you the food they also give you this great sauce which I usually put a lot on. 

If you are looking for real, authentic Mexican food than this is your place! Just be warned that it is a small place so it gets busy and packed fast. Here is a video I found of the place http://bit.ly/yrcmty
