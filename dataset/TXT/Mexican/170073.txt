lYsq47uDzdjYUGtyUq8aaQ This restaurant is the only reason to I would go to The World Market Center. 

For dinner we started off with the grilled octopus and skirt steak skewers. Both were soooooo flavorful. The octopus had great seasoning and was served on greens with some sauce on the side that this dish did not need (because it was already tasty).

The skirt steak skewers were also seasoned deliciously and came with a cup of chopped avocado. The skewers had these tender cubes of steak on them. 

My friend and I shared and entree and the server was nice enough to tell the kitchen to split it on two plates for us. The sea scallops were amazing. There was a little mango garnished on the top and was on a bed of rice. 

During the night there were girls coming around doing taste tests of different margaritas with and without Grand Marnier. This was a great addition to have to our dinner. 

Throughout the night service was attentive and our server was sweet enough to put up with us asking her to take our pictures. Her recommendations were on point and I want to come back soon to try the many other items on the menu that looked fantastic.
