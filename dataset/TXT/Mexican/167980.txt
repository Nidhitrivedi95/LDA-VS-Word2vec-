The avocado dip for the chips is AMAZING!! My girls and I loved it! Myself and one of my daughters ordered the chicken avocado plate. It was REALLY good. I was expecting a larger chicken to avocado ratio though. There isn't much meat at all. Everything was seasoned well and had nice flavor. Everything on the menu looked so good that we definitely have to go back to try more dishes. I definitely recommend the cactus margarita. SO GOOD! I ordered a small and it was a good sized glass. I'll go there for that again too!
