XfUoM-27iPHkbewPXepmFQ I have to give them three stars because the food looked wonderful and fresh. I have had their food before a while ago.   But then I saw the prices.  Who spends almost $9 for lunch.  With drink and all, that's what you would pay.  Too expensive for what it is.  I can go to a place where they serve you and it would not be much more.  I hope I am not being too cheap.  But think about it.  If you are a working person and you spend $9 for lunch, multiply that by 20 working days in a month and you've got $180.  That's a car note.  That's why so many people file for bankruptcy these days.  .....   Just a thought.   I know the chicken and accompaniments were probably delicious but ...... you know.
