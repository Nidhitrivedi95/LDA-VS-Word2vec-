hkpP3kY_x_zVpVz8gQ0ErA I came by to try this place since I was on the East side of town before work since i seen some positive reviews here on Yelp. I ordered the beef burrito and a beef taco. The food was good but some reason I was expecting something more (different?). The burrito and taco seemed pretty typical except the beef had a sweet glaze. I was some how expecting some kim chi to be there but i guess not. Service was quick and who I think was the owner was friendly.
