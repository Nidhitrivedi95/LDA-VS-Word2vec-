CZhc8YXdFLhAI4ViC2ERTg Good food Good Service. I've been coming to Viva Mercado's for 20 years. I've seen them go through multiple locations , changes etc. I feel like they are doing really well after opening their new location a couple years ago. I eat Mexican regularly through out Las Vegas. I've seen competing restaurants do really well and take a down hill Fall  on food quality so to see Viva Mercado's continue to do strive made me glad to see.
