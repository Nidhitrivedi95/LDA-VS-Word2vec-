As for the food. I'll start with the good -- tacos off the menu (my shrimp taco and my friend's coffee-braised-beef) were delicious. A little bland, but their give chips/salsa with various salsas that helped add a nice little kick. I also got street corn, which they drizzle/slather jalepeno mayo and cotija cheese on. It was amazing, I ate every last bite of it. I have to take a star off though because the daily taco (chicken with a jalepeno marinade) and tres leches cake was not impressive. Daily taco I can understand, it was a $2 deal at happy hour. And salsas helped make it pretty good. But the tres leches cake was more dry than it should have been. It did have a nice mango topping though!

I sat at the bar and had excellent service. My receipt said my server was Eric -- thanks for taking good care of us! Everything came out quickly and our drinks were quickly refilled :)

Oh and parking isn't the easiest -- the lot gets packed and has some reserved spots for Buffalo Exchange nearby. There is street parking nearby. I drove around the lot twice and found a spot that (thankfully) wasn't reserved by buffalo exchange.
