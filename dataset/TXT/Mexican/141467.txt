jBKJMUcMuBmHqe5_U7GQ0Q I try to give this place the benefit of the doubt. The chips and salsa are decent enough, the food is decent enough, but I swear I get the worst waitress every time I visit.

Me: Do you have any beer specials?
Waitress: Huh?
Me: ... I'll have a Tecate.
Waitress: A what? Our beer have weird names.
...
Me: I'll have the Pastor taco special.
Waitress: I don't think we have that.
Me: It's on the chalkboard in the lobby.
Waitress: I've never heard of it so I don't think we do.

The food is fine. I've not had a bad meal here, despite the 12oz Tecates costing $5.50 which is absurd. However, this is one of many bad service experiences I've had.
