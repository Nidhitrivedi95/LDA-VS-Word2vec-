The quesadillas were just OK with a different spin on them. They were open face with a small crunchy tortilla on top to give it some crunch I guess and they used a mild type of a Mexican white cheese. Be careful because the food is very messy since there's a lot of stuff they put on it. It's a super busy place and  very unorganized. It was confusing for the first time and I didn't know where to start to order. Not being fluent Spanish doesn't help and I don't think they care to help because you're in their territory so figure it out yourself. I found it was kind of cafeteria style where you order from one station and go to the next. But when I went to the next, some new arrivals were there trying to order things and I thought they were taking cuts. Maybe I was wrong because there were different starting points. Who knows but the food was OK.
