Why the 4 stars?  Yo, I ordered the chocolate de wannabe creme brûlée thingamajig and it only came with two slits of ginger snaps cookies (like the kind you pay 3 bucks for at ikea). I ordered two more of them rectangles and they charged me 50 cents!  They charged me 50 cents for two rectangles of a graham cracker (remember a whole graham cracker has 4 rectangles).  Man, as I eat those cookies I lost my appetite for the dessert (rarely happens). I didn't even want to take it home.  I felt like I got carjacked and I wasn't even driving. Carjacked by ginger snap cookies, from ikea!!! Wtf!? 

Ahhh, but I'll be back. I'll just stay away from them cookies.
