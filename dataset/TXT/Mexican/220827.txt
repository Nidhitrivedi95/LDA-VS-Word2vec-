rjlAUHT8B6KhKAmkZqS1xw I thought the food was decent. My friend and I were annoyed that we couldn't mix and match the tacos and had to get three of the same. Our waiter was in our face and asking us if we needed something every 30 seconds which seemed like overkill. I loved the decor and setting. Hopefully the waiter and taco situation will get sorted out in time!
