VXlK-DWw4ADR4TE7Eou5Dg Maybe its the time of year, but it was a great night here at Margaitas. The tables are full of happy people, eating and drinking. The food is a delight, I had the chicken platter with all the makings of your own fajitas. What a great street Baldwin is. Sayid was a great server, happy smiling guy. Try it right away, while its still summer.
