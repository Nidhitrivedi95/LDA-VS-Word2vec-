IYpaW7h8aPYKIK84_ZKMIg Delicious food.  Excellent service.  Staff is very attentive and immediately serves you with complementary chips and salsa.  Happy hour before 6pm on weekdays gets a few dollars off on Margaritas and wine.  Tacos are delicious and are customizable at the toppings bar which include various condiments.  The shrimp taco was my favorite.  The shrimp fajitas are also tasty and they give a very generous portion of large fresh tasting shrimp seasoned perfectly.  Prices are very reasonable.  Very happy with my first experience here and will be coming back soon!
