2g6x4ISNiMxFnotBuwmZmw Tacos were soggy and cold, not to mention worse quality than Taco Bell. Waitress got my order of tacos wrong and food took 30 minutes if not more to arrive, when people all around us (who got there after) were getting their food plenty faster. Waitress was then watching and hounding me to sign the receipt before I even had a chance to finish my food. Bummy place.
