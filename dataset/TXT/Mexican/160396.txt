kxzS-zh5nUNvBzYz2Q47pg Went to the Spotted Donkey for Cinco De Mayo.  The restaurant was crowded as expected. Fortunately, we had reservations. I had read various reviews and we were pleasantly surprised with or dining experience.  We sat outside on the patio. As crowded as the restaurant was or service was excellent!  Matthew the servicer was always there for us. The Busser Michael always kept or water glasses full and would get Matthew for drink needs promptly.  The chicken tacos and pork tacos were excellent?
I Decided that I wanted tequila instead of dessert.  The manager Susan was quite knowledgable on the tequila choices.  I deciding on a Herradura anejo.
The only negative was that our guacamole was not made at the table, but then you can't have everything.
