SWDxTrwU_qlEcJp36IYquw Was very excited for some Cuban food. I loved the service. They are very nice there. No bathroom though. So... Hold it in.

I got a Cuban sandwich. Was so excited! But I agree with some others reviews. The bread was so dry. If was like saltines... I almost felt like it was a day old bread. 

Overall ok. But I need to go back to try something else and see if it was just the Cuban sandwich. Obviously, it's a great place to get 4.5 stars. Stay tuned....
