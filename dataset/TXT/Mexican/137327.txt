Just got off the phone with Margaret from the store and she stated that unless specified, the dressing does not come with. First off, I reviewed my order prior to submitting and there was dressing asked for. Second, There actually isn't a check box for this in their online ordering site. It shows up once you get to the review portion of the order before you submit. Margaret then asked if I wanted the whole salad remade or just the dressing. I said just the dressing. She then stated that I could come in at a later time to pick it up. I said I would be on my way now to pick up dressing. I have even attached an picture of my order that shows the dressing was supposed to be included. I would retrain Margaret on her customer service skills are her tone of voice was harsh as if I was inconveniencing her.
