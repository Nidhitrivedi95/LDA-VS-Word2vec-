x7RRLRKyKdME9X3GuR5-5w Service was horrible. 20 minitues for a margarita in a empty restaurant on a saturday. I reserved a table for a set time for 15 ppl. One waitress with a bad attitude. I wasnt ready to order when every one else ordered thinking shell come back in a few moments to take my order or refill drinks... nope! Everyone got there food. Still no refill on drinks. Finally took my order and another guest at the table. When i got my food after 45 minutes of ordering in the not so busy place. She trys to explain to the other guest that they kitchen had no shrimp thawed. I had it at this point and asked to speak to a manager. He explained he didnt know what was goin on as he just got there and gave attitude. So i pulled him aside. And talked to him. He gave us 50 percent off our tab. Which still dont make up for a very poor staff attitude. To top ot all off, i ask for to go boxes and follwed the hostest to the bar. And stood there as she was talking to another employee and texting on thier cell phones.. i paid the tab and ran into another manager as i was leaving and explained to him how poor service was and i wouldnt ever return to this location. He shruged it off as he didnt care and said "that sucks"....  i didnt get my meal and only offerd one drink from the bar the two hours i was there. Note that they ran out of the liqure most was drinking and they couldnt atleast tell us sooner that the shrimp dish wouldnt be made..
