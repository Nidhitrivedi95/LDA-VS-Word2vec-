1ZgqJjtb91E9tOKhKrzsuw I thought I was eating in my favorite family restaurant in San Luis, Mexico! Excellent food; authentic taste with a current twist and all made fresh. The chips and salsa are memorable here. Excellent service; Joel was perfection! His recommendations were exactly what we wanted but just didn't know it! I had the sangria- made fresh and delicious but watch out! Don't fall in!
We will eat here again next time we are in the area.
