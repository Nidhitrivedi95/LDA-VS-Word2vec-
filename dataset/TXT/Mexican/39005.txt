6BcIG-1lnc58bxTlxQq17A I've lived on Woodlawn Road for 10 years and tonight decided what the hell, why not check out Tres Pesos for the first time with my gf to sit at the bar--instead of going to Azteca where we would normally go on Woodlawn.  

Great atmosphere, great looking bar, better than average margaritas.

However, the bar tender rolled her eyes at me when I tried to get her attention to tell her I ordered corn tortillas and not flour tortillas which was her mistake.

The steak fajitas had NO flavor at all, and the onions and peppers were dripping with oil.  Picture unmarinated beef mixed with onions and peppers and dropped into the deep fryer.  

My gf called the manager over so we wouldn't have to deal with the rude bartender again.  The bartender claimed nobody else complained about the fajitas all day, so why are WE?  

Thanks Tres Pesos, way to go out of your way to show customers who point out your substandard food that their constructive criticism is not welcome.
