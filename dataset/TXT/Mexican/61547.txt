aTvmLm3YfTs_L290fEolEw Food by far is the best around and we have a lot of choices in the area. The reason for 3 stars is the kids eat free on sundays policy. Every time we go in it's a different standard. I.e.: kids must be present, kids don't get a drink on f not present, kid looks to old for free kids meal, flat out no. I just want to know what's the policy. I understand if kids must be present I'm ok with that it's just like I'm stealing whenever I ask for it cause it's never given to you. So all around very good food and we love it. The rewards program is wonderful too.
