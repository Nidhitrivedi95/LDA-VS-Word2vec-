p6FPcgLymnpk_gAyQuW_Mw Been there more than a few times, but never ordered food.....until now. I stopped in late about 9pm after class one day and ordered a carne asada burrito and drinky-drank to sip on. I saw no other customers, so I wasn't sure if they were still serving food, but one of the guys there said he'll be right with me. I ordered my food and after he was finished cooking the meat, he let me pick and choose what I wanted inside my burrito too. 

Well good thing I got there when I did, because when I was finished paying the line was already 7 people deep and bustling with customers. 

Service: The cook, cashier and a random worker were all friendly and didn't get creepy vibe at all.. haha

Food: I wish I took a picture before I started but it was huge! I ate half and saved the rest for lunch the next day. 

This place is good any time of day and not just for those late night after partying food cravings...well maybe that too:)
