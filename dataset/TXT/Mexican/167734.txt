LtO6vTBfYzlgWArn3kRe_A Crazy how they won't give you carne asada fry's plate with out the fry's. I had talk to the manager and said to her I would pay extra so they won't give me fry's. She then said to me no because i can use that meat to make tacos and give them to my family which was very retarded when it was just me and my friend.
