erx8tQ0Wdc5YM0FddaKqKA There are so many taco places opening up in Pittsburgh and if you want to be on top you have to step up your game Tres Rios.  We went on a Friday night and were seated right away by a friendly host. Our waitress was great and the food and drinks came out very quickly.  The  happy hour special was pretty disappointing and the house margaritas were $6. I don't really call that a special but we ordered two and they were very tasty.  Another thing that they really need to do is give out free chips and salsa or for a very minimum price ($2-$4).  The only option was an appetizer of 3 salsas with chips for $8.  We really didn't want to pay for all of that but I am glad we tried out their 3 salsas which were mediocre.  For my entrée I went with the chicken tacos.  They do not come with cheese and I had to pay an extra $1 to get cheese on my tacos which I was not very pleased about. The portions are great and the presentation of the entrees is excellent.  My 3 tacos were served with a side of salsa and green rice.  The taco shells were different. What I liked is that they were sturdy and did not fall apart and also very fresh. What I didn't  like was they were greasy.  My husband ordered a burrito which was served with a side salad. He was very pleased with his choice and the salad had a nice light, lime dressing.
