9d7N-I00hu-VkXFry4Da-g I may be spoiled because I come from LA where the Mexican food everywhere is amazing but this place shouldn't be considered Mexican. Should be called tex-mex at best since even the salsas aren't even spicy enough or tasty enough. They're basically tomato sauce you could add your pasta to. And what "Mexican" restaurant charges for extra onions, cilantro and jalapeños? You could get handfuls of that for free at a taco truck. Very basic place. I'm again not from here and just here for work, but best place I had for Mexican so far in Phoenix is Irma's kitchen.
