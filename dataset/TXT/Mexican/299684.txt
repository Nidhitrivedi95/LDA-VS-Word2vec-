ZkUWOdBA4T7pdUhT0dkRzQ It was my 4th visit to Barrio Queen tonight and I am sad to say, my last. As the food is pretty darn good, I wanted to make this place a go to spot, but the service/experience is too much to bare. Out of four trips, only my prior visit was decent. We thought things were on the up swing, but tonight was the nail in the coffin. 

To start, the text reservation system failed and at least one couple who came in after us was seated before. We waited 20 minutes (not bad) but there were a lot of open tables so it was hard to understand why. Anyway, when I went up and asked where were in line, I got an poor excuse that their text system was acting up. Ok, fine, but I literally was 5 feet from the hostess stand the entire time and there were ZERO other people waiting in side. No name call as a back up.  It rubbed me the wrong way that there was no apology, just a bad excuse.

We were seated promptly after questioning our position, but from here, it did not improve. Appetizer came and we had no place setting or napkins, worse, nobody around to ask. Finally grabbed some cocktail napkins from the bar to hold us over.  We had the queso fundido so didn't need the utensils, but it wasn't as hot as it should have been, so we had to spoon it onto the chips with our fingers. Then the entrees came before we done with the app, again, nobody to help the runner with the full table, so we hand to stack stuff up and make room for him to set stuff down. We were pretty much done with our drinks at this point, no refill or chance for one though out the entire entree. Luckily we only had to wait about 5 minutes to ask for the check.
