lhcSKpqOyKwaC70zu-3X5Q My work catered a whole bunch of food from here and to be honest... everything was off. The food was ordered mild and it was still somewhat spicy and that bothered some people. The taste was underwhelming and I stopped short as I didn't want to get sick from this. The guacamole probably the worst I've tasted in awhile and it somewhat watery? Weird.

I filled up on their decent salsa and nacho chips. That was OK.
