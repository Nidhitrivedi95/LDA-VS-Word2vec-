92_L_cBI11zfiFkxLs7Agw Still happy I chose this food truck over the other options that night. 
The rest seemed more the generic variety and not offering anything special. 

I appreciated Rock-A-Belly's more unique offerings setting themselves apart from the other options.  

I had the Mash Pit fries, they had good flavor but also were not very crispy at all, which left me a little disappointed for the price.  I think if they were cooked longer they could have been really good.  

I also had the Chubby I think.  And it was good though the meat seemed a little dry to me.  

Not writing this be harsh in anyway, the even we were had was packed and I was still happy with my choice over the others offered.  If the fries were cooked longer the meat was a little juicer or had more flavor to them and not just flavorful sauce on top, this would be 4 stars for sure.  Food did come out quick which was nice considering how many people were at the event.
