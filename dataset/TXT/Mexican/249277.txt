ufwkkMd9yr9cFU1R5ONArg love their food. Absolutely the best  option in the neighbourhood....BUT having a bill add up to $50 for 2 means our visits are few and far between. Also found with a full house the one server can't seem to handle all the covers and service wanes...and at that price tag it doesn't leave one with a great feeling when the bill arrives. Another server and a few bucks shaved off the menu would have me there much more often.
