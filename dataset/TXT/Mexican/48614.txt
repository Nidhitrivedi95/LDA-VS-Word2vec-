8CcmHGUGlEEF2eNvS3ndMg One of the most authentic Mexican restaurants I have been to in the GTA. I was the first to arrive from a party of 4, and was greeted by friendly staff. Despite waiting quite some time for my friends to trickle their way in, the servers were kind and always kept my glass full. 

Since the appetizers and mains were relatively affordable, we opted to try as many dishes as our stomachs can handle, without the worry of emptying our wallets. We had the guacamole and nachos to start, and boy was that a wonderful start to a feast. The tri-coloured nachos were succulently crunchy, topped with a prized amount of ground beef, sour cream, cheese, tomatoes and other ingredients. The creamy guacamole was complimented with smoking hot tortilla chips, an indication that it was made fresh and in-house. On the side were two types of sauces that I do not know the name of, but the orange sauce was more spicy than the Extra-hot Peri Peri Sauce from Nandos! I must have been a daredevil to smother that on my chips.

The mains we ordered were the stuffed quesadillas, fish tacos (half off on Fridays), carne asada and emmoladas. My favourite has got to the be the fish tacos and emmoladas. The fillets were fried, yet maintains a subtle scent of the sea. Topped with a generous douse of lime juice, the flavours came alive. The emmoladas, corn tortillas rolled around chicken breast and covered with a chili pepper sauce, were equally tasty. The strength in this dish lie in the perfect meld of chocolate and beans. I claim to be no expert in food tasting, but the unique and bizarre combination here works wonders. 

It is unfortunate I failed to discover this place having resided in the area for 2 years. I highly recommend those with a craze for Mexican food to let Haciendas cater to your delight.
