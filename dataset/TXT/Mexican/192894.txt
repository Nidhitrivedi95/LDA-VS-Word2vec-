oN_A87dyVD2FBk7coLnhCg Not sure what the big whoop us..It was ok. We had cal burrito..it had plenty of chicken..really bland.they give you a little plastic container of sauce you can add later but flavor isn't cooked in. It had no beans..no rice..no lettuce..no guacamole..a small amt of cheese...and a dab of what I guess was salsa..again bland.  The size waa ok but for $8 expected more.  Was disappointed no guac inside.  Not sure what they think made it a calif burrito?  It was just chicken.  The service was ok it wasn't too busy so took about 10-15 minutes w 2 others ahead.  We might go back if in a pinch, we live around the corner so I was hoping it was better ..we would've been there all the time.  Oh well.
