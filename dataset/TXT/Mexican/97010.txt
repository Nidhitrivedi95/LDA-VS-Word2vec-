eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw First off very GREAT service from Mark ask for him
when you go ! Second very awesome nachos I tried the enchilada nachos with chicken and red sauce it was super delicious ! They have a cool deal also with the purchase of a entree you get a FREE HOUSE MARGARITA  and it wasn't just a whack margarita it was still very strong even though it was free. We stay a The D hotel so if your staying there or golden nugget it very short 5 min walk this place is very good and kid friendly also !
