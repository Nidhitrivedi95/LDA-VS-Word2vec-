4SWx95nlvFKzI9uzpQ6wjQ Was literally there at 6:51 my order was taken by LARISSA tall female red hair when I approached the window she told me I total said it then I asked to add a coke she made a second order for it I said I need it on the same order not split she said "I could do that" then proceeded to not do it then told its X amount and that she couldn't do math so I had to pull my phone out and do it for her she definitely shouldn't be working there she should be in school. Everyone else was great though
