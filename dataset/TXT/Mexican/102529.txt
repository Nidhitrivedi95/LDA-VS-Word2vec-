F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw Finally tried this place, but won't bore you with all the details of my day/my dinner date/the weather/various other unrelated information that many Yelpers seem to be a fan of.

We arrived a little after 5 on a Saturday, and snagged the last two seats at the bar.  All the other tables were reserved, so if you're dining out with a group I'd definitely recommend making reservations.  They offer samplers/flights of margaritas and guacamole, and they offer unusual flavors.  

We did a margarita sampler with hibiscus, spicy mango, & blood orange, all of which were good and I would consume in their full-sized version.
We had a hard time deciding which guac to choose, since they all sounded so amazing.  We went with the goat cheese guac, and this is a decision that we did not regret.
We chose to share the carnitas taquitos, which was a good idea because the portion was definitely too much for one person.  The food was very good and the service was very prompt and friendly.  We will definitely go back.
