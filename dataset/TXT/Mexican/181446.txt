nEIWxj6m1gGWe1gi596Zvg Always happy with Chipolte even if I twitch when they tell me GUAC is extra... I know I Know , I always get the Barbacoa.. tried the chicken once.. it was eh.. I get all the salsas.. this location is always packed but I seem to get in and out fast enough.. with all the bad press lately I wanted to write a review to show my Chipolte love.. never a bad experience.. never got sick.. Oh and dam good Ice tea... once there was a guac shortage that was upsetting but not there fault lol , I have never gotten out of there under 11 dollars.. portions have shrunk since they first opened but still feeling the love
