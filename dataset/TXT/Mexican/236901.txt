SW6ZQk22G1_CV81_gfnvNQ I came for brunch service (when they still had this at the end of summer) with my cousin.  We had a mango avocado salad, the lamb bacon and eggs taco, churros, and really terrific cocktails - I had a tomatillo Caesar.

The mango avocado salad was probably more on the average side (but still delicious), but the lamb bacon really kicked it out of the park for me.  It's like regular brunch with a flavourful twist in the lamb.  I've also had churros at a couple of places in Toronto, and still, La Carnita is my fave in terms of taste + just the right crunchy texture.

Also, the Caesar packs a punch but is a very tasty drink.

This place is perfect for casual dining and great eats. Yum!
