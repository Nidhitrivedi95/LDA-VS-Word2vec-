1dI4oRq8wQrMs15nnj9TLA Smokes Burritorie is having their grand opening today. They are offering $1 burritos."The toppings sound pretty typical for a burrito joint and include rice, refried beans, chorizo and pulled pork. All proceeds from the $1 wraps will go towards The Donkey Sanctuary, a 100-acre safe haven for neglected donkeys located in Guelph, Ontario."

This place used to be the Burrito Boyz, but they moved a few doors west. Now Smoke's Burritorie is right below/beside Smoke's Poutinerie. I think Burrito Boyz has some competition. Although the $1 burrito offer was pretty sweet, the line up took forever, but the upside is that they did come out to give us some nacho chips and salsa which was a nice gesture. 

I am sure the quality of the burrito was not up to their standards since they were just pumping out burritos like it was an Asian sweatshop factory (BTW no Asian workers). I will revisit to see if they quality is as great as their poutines are when they are working a normal lunch or dinner rush. Each burrito goes from $7.50 - $9.00 or you can go for a naked bowl for $9.00. Pretty standard prices for the entertainment district. They have different burrito options such as Chicken, Pork, Steak, and Veggie. I had the Steak burrito (El Gran Toro aka The Big Bull) and was impressed with how filling and flavorful the burrito was. It had Marinated Flat Iron Steak, Lime Cilantro Rice, Smoke's Refried Beans, Sweet Corn, Salsa, Crispy Onions, Crisp Lettuce, Citrus Slaw, Sour Cream, Fresh Jalapenos, and House Guac. Look at those ingredients baby!! Only issue was, I felt they could have grilled it a bit better on both sides as only one side had grill marks, and you gotta have that crisp bite when you eat a burrito. Am I right, or am I right? Hope to give an update soon to see if it is worthy of a 5 star. Jimstar Out!!
