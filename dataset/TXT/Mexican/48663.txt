8D4VMtrHQ5qBnRhYycq8IA I just love this place.

They satisfy all of the needs one has for hard-to-find Mexican groceries. They have a selection of queso fresco in their front fridge, incredible chorizo, and an overwhelmingly good assortment of imported Mexican treats, beverages and sauces (the hot sauce with chapulines looks incredible!)

In case this isn't enough, walk past the grocery area into their small dining area, where you will be given a menu to order some of the tastiest, most authentically prepared and inexpensive Mexican food in the city! Yum!
