Great atmosphere! Oyster Bar! Margaritas!

We ordered the shrimp basket (delish and spicy!), guac and chips (ask for their hot sauce, it's made fresh) and a few tacos. Everything was great. The drinks, the food, the server... it was PACKED on the Thursday night we went. We had resos for 7pm.  The place was lively, good music and people everywhere.

Definitely going back to try the crab bucket, the octopus tacos and all their other goodies. Very authentic Mexican.

We ordered three appies, two orders of tacos, a bucket of beer, four margaritas and with tax it was $133 for two people. Not bad for a birthday dinner. We left VERY full and VERY happy.  Can't wait to go back.
