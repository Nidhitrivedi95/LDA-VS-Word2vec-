36GvUjLg3drdOB3jgpqTOQ The food is fine, not great. Staff and service is average. 

This review is mainly to warn patrons of the clientele who frequent this restaurant/ bar and night club.  As I say this, I want to make it known that I share ethnicity with these folks I am warning against...gang bangers galore.  It is the Chandler, AZ variety; however many of these people are up to no good and are willing to do violence at a moments notice.  

I for one will not go back which is sad because I have had many fun nights dancing with friends and family.
