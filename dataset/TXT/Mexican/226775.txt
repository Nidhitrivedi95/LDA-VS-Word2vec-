S_bG5WWbtNXhhY9Y0GTcSg The best breakfast I've had in central phoenix.  The mood fantastic.   We went there for the first time on Saturday for coffee and had to come back for breakfast this morning.  My GF asked if they would rewarm her meal which had gone cool, and the owner, Maria, walked out with a hot plate and some banana bread that was killer.  I guessed was from Spain and I was right .   I'll be back many times!!!!
