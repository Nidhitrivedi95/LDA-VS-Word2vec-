XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg it was pretty good for a "celebrity chef" restaurant.

the tiger shrimp tamale was real good. lots of flavor.
the pork tenderloin real tender but the sauces i could do without. 
the raw tuna nachos were just ok. 
the salmon was good for salmon. usually i feel like salmon is bland. but this one wasn't too bland.
the pesto cilantro mashed potatoes were good. 
the chili relleno was eh. 

the desserts were rich. the chocolate was on the bitter side.

it wasn't spectacular. it was better than expected.
