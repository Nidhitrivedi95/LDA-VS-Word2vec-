4kDLEb1OgE7IrO54lCkn3A La Cocina Economica Toronto's most authentic Mexican eats. Walking through the door and greeted by a huge smile and a welcome was La Cocina's manager Javier (, I think really our good time vibe was started here). Chef Samantha's perfectly seasoned fixin's waiting to be seized by your tortilla. Her incredible palate shines making each bite an adventure south full of taste and pleasure. Will I be back, unfortunately they are closed Sunday's, soooo, definitely on Monday.
