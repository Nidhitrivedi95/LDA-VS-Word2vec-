-Qkx7W0itbAApcG5lJuMFQ Since my family and I visited Vegas December 2016, the place has been on one of my "TO GO" places. Not to say I wouldn't have this to go... anywho.

This trip I decided to take my fiance here and try this Mexican Japanese fusion place. When we walked in, we were immediately greeted by the cashier in a upbeat and jovial voice.  She handed us a menu and we proceeded to look. Prices were decent with each burrito averaging around $12.

Ordering was easy. If you choose to do combination, it's $3.50 which includes a side and drink. 

Decent place with decent price. Hope people take a look and eat at this new wonder!
