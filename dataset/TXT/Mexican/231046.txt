sJHf_8i4iky2yU4-PS1ksQ Excellent service and even better food. This Mexican food is actually as authentic as it gets. Just like the best places in Mexico that offer amazing home-cooked Mexican cuisine, this place isn't exactly decorated to be beautiful and 'mexican'. It is a simple and clean decor. The food, however, is simply delicious. I love this place.
