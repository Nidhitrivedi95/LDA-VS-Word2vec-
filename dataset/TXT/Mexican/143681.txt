JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg I love the fact that this place serves organic and non GMO food/ingredients. It used to be 50% off for locals, but it went down to 25% off and the prices kept rising it seemed like every time that I went back, but it's still great food and 25% off just for living in Las Vegas. They also started charging for things like refills on chips and salsa, which caused one of my friends to stop going. I also don't go nearly as often as I used to because of such things.
