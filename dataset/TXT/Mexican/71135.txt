C2BR0TjNacoNzItPLUHTAA This place is absolutely fabulous!! It reminds me instantly of a sea town like Key West, Fl with its feel and decor. The staff is attentive and pleasant at this fast casual restaurant that apparently comes straight from Maui, HI, their other location. 

This makes me want to go to Hawaii now. Their calamari is in sticks meaning they use the body instead of rings/tentacles. Very tender well breaded.

The fish tacos are totally crazy good. Mexico City meets Maui in an explosion of flavors. The owner told us the fish is flow in from Hawaii daily. The price tag is a tad high for tacos but I dont care. They are worth every penny.

Now the only dilemna, is when can I go back?
