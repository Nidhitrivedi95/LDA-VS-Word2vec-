ZkUWOdBA4T7pdUhT0dkRzQ First time here. I ordered three tacos: one of the special cochinita pibil tacos and two camaron adado tacos. They were soggy. So wet, in fact that there was a puddle on my plate. I asked our server (who took like 15 minutes to even help us), and she said that's normal, it's because of the cabbage. What?!  Very disappointing. My hands were so covered in sticky taco water that I really wanted a shower at that point.

Additionally, the place was about half full, but they crammed all of us into one corner. So, the people behind me would jam their chair into me when they got up.

The only reason I give two stars is that, for all the water, the tacos still had really great flavor. If these had been like normal street tacos, I'd probably give this place at least 3 if not 4 stars.

I'll try it again and update later.
