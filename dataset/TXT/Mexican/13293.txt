0jAexNHRHhkQv4zNYqenBA Ok so I have been here before and the experience wasn't that bad, that's why I went back - well that was a mistake! P.S. My review will be similar to the one for Hi Fi because, well, they both sucked the same!
 
I went last Saturday night and this place was like a sardine can!! SUPER wayy too packed! There was NO room for dancing, or even just mingling. Frankly, you couldn't even breathe!! Brushing elbows? More like brushing noses! It was miserable and as soon as I felt my claustrophobia kicking in I needed to escape! We were about to leave when this guy started talking to me, lucky for me he did because we found a small 2 feet by 2 feet area we could a least attempt to dance in as they started to play some awesome salsa jams. Best 5 minutes of music we had heard all night so we bounced our little hearts out, all of the white guys in complete shock at seeing these two little Latin fire crackers break it down lol, annnnd then we left. 

Seriously though, who wants to "party" like that?? I want to be able to mingle, get a drink fairly quick, DANCE and I don't know have room to breathe and chill out. I know places may be popular and "thee place to be", but it would seem way more exclusive and maybe even worth paying entry if the atmosphere was right.

Like really EL HEFE they have "maximum occupancy" laws for a reason! I could not imagine what would happen if a fire broke out! This place is not only NOT fun, but also NOT safe! 

I don't see myself ever going back on a Sat night. The ONLY reason I gave them 2 stars and not 1 is because my friend and I didn't have to wait in their long ass line. We walked up to the front and they just let us in lol.
