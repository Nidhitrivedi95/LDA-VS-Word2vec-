izNFwY0XMPsmmUDaSzB9ig I'm shocked to see the negative reviews. We've been twice and it was awesome. I've had the taco salad, chorizo empanada and my fav, the churros and ice cream. It's all great. The service is okay, but the management is fantastic. They have always stepped up when there were mistakes. I'm hoping this place does well.
