7-Ba9uSmYYpXgnQRoIPxMQ Review for a Saturday: This place was recommended from some Vegas locals. We were mainly looking for dinner, latin music, and dancing. FYI the taxi fare from Venetian to Havana was $40 each way! BIG MISTAKE 
We got there at 11pm...Dj playing great music, bar empty, dance floor empty. About 30 ppl total having dinner, some with children. We had reserved a table by dance floor. It's a shame we had dinner and left...back to the strip...no one to dance with at Havanas!
I thought the food was good. My Cuban friend thought she'd had better. Service was slow for a slow night. Music was great but super loud and hard to have a conversation  and had to do more sign and point with waitress when ordering. I would suggest lowering the music (since was more of an eating crowd,and empty dance floor) at least until a good dance crowd would show up.
