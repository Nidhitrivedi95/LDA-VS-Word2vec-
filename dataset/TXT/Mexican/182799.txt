NjDC1Evc2Wa6ykj8xVpoUw Very Good.....and consistent.  Service is great.  The young lady who has taken our order the last 2 times is very pleasant.  The food is great.  Fast service.  My husband loves the wahoo bowl w the Cajun beans and brown rice.  He eats the entire meal...which is odd for him.  I love everything I have tried including the amazing guacamole.  One of our faves!
