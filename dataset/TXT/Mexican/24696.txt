2XkVexeY_8zyc9nriSElQg Stumbled across this place enroute to the strip. Family style Mexican place (my favorite types). I had a few carneasada tacos $2/ea. They were goooooood. I guess I am not that experienced to really criticize tacos, but I know what Iike. Fresh meat, cilantro, onions, taco and guacamole will do it for me. loved this place and loved the fact I was treated sith kindmess from the moment I walked in as a lost Japanese kid with little to no knowledge of mexican foods... they prep your order right in front of you Nd have it ready immediately. .. great stuff I cant wait to go back.
