The staff was very friendly, there was a little wait time but we did go in on a busy Friday night, so I don't blame them on the wait. 

The drinks are cheap and they have a nice selection of Mexican beers.

The prices are very reasonable and 3 of us ate and drank very well for under $50.

I will most definitely be going back to get more of the delicious food and great service.
