xLeOANU-lqtDOIV6Owm3EQ Nope!  I should have known better than to eat out of a truck.  Not sure how this truck gets 5 stars.  I ordered the chicken burrito.  It did not come with rice and beans as the pictures show.  The chicken is shredded chicken and is gross.  It was greasy and messy and all around not very good.  The truck is old and run down.  I would not recommend this place at all. I only ate 1/2 of it just because I was so hungry. It does not come with slur cream or cheese.
