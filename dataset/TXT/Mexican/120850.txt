h-Oq86DZfZad9kKXe8m7Lg I came here after craving Mexican food, and checking out these reviews! So glad I did. I brought my family, and my dad is from Mexico City. This restaurant advertises it's Mexico City style food, so we were particularly excited. We came in and were promptly greeted, and noticed it was pretty full. Like the name suggests, they have a wide selection of tortas! My brother ordered the Del Rey, which they mentioned is the most popular. He loved it, my dad loved it, and everyone was happy. The menu is pretty large and you'll have a lot to choose from, and includes some tried and true favorites- like the quesadilla. Our food came out maybe ten minutes after we ordered it. So fast!! My dad commented on how authentic the food was, and everyone enjoyed what they ordered. I'll definitely be back. If you want good Mexican, skip the chains and come here!
