G8LBVca1vOBKYeMCMpajGA i love this place..... half the time...


I need to find out the hours the good passionate cook works...

this place is literally the best and absolute WORST mexican food in Vegas.

It just depends on when you go. There is a cook there you can tell actually cares about making good food.. and when hes working the food comes out absolutely amazing!!!! 5 stars!!!

But then, half the time I order, i can barely eat it.... its sad... you can tell the cook just slopped shit together and gave ZERO shits if the food was good...

No passion nor care for service... im trying to figure out this cooks schedule. because the other ones are ruining the restaurant. They have all the ingredients they need back there to make good food... its a shame more than half your cooks dont have the passion, nor the care! to make good food.... seriously its night and day.... its either amazing, or non edible...

Owner needs to crack down or hire a manager who isn't hiring garbage friends.

I bet every bad review is coming from those shitty cooks too... the good one is a gem and i bet every good review is from when he was working. smh...
