Iw9k29FJCZ0fC68oxK1NtA Cool LITTLE taco place in Kent. I got a chicken taco and a steak taco. Both were massive, and essentially the size of burritos. The chicken taco was pretty good, but the steak taco was meh. This is coming from someone who says the same thing about Chipotle chicken and steak. I think I just don't like cheap steak on tacos/burritos. Overall, cool little place and I would consider going back if I was in the area.
