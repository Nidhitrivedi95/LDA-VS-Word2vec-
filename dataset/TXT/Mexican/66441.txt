BEplfZTUzYwApjMUaOA12w I was pretty impressed with this place. I didn't expect much because it is a Mexican restaurant within an Italian themed hotel in Vegas (The Venetian). However, they had a great happy hour with four dollar and five dollar drinks between 4 and 7 PM and the food was excellent. The service was a little bit slow but that does not take away from the fact that when they were around, they were very attentive and nice. So I did not deduct any stars for that. That Miss fear is beautiful and be sure to ask for a table on the canal where the gondolas swing by. The view is breathtakingly amazing. I would definitely recommend and return on my next trip to Vegas.
