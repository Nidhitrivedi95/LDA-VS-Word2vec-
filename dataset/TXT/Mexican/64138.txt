When I first heard of the concept of Japanese sushi rolls combined with Mexican food, I was thrilled. However upon closer inspection and digestion, I found that the Mexican part of the equation was lacking, severely. This is a burrito joint without flour tortillas! That would be like a burger place without any buns! Meats like Al Pastor, Adobada, and Carnitas were not offered. Mariscos were not included either. They didn't even give you the option of adding Tapatio or Valentina to your burrito, much less things like salsa verde, and roja. This is at best a Chipotle + Sushi combination. 

The food is good, it's made well and the service is prompt, but I think the fusion especially the burrito part is a giant misnomer.
