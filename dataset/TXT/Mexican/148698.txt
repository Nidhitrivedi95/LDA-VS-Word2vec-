They really want you to enjoy yourself at Served.  The chef came by our table to check on our experience.  The front of house was very attentive despite the frantic pace he kept while servicing the room.

On the advice of our server, I had the soft-shell Benedict - a bright hollandaise drizzled across a crisp tempura-battered soft-shell crab and poached eggs with slightly spicy seasoning.  My husband indulged his Filipino side and had the tocilog and a side of span musubi.  He raved about the authenticity and quality of the food.

Do yourself a favor and go to Served ASAP!
