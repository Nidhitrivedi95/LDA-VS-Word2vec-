thLX_k20SPJ0KyusGTBIHw Pineapple Braised Pork is one of my favorite tacos in the city! The place has a real hacienda feel, as it was a pottery shop before, so its design and layout are as simple as they get. Great selection of food, great quality and their Taco Mondays are a nice relief if you're looking to get your taco fix early on in the week. Salsa selection is good, with a little bit of everything and I'm curious to have their tuna poke bowls!
