VBVqHnViRLSYAqP7v8iNNQ I would rather email our experience to management, but there is no contact info on the website. My husband and I live around the corner and stop by for happy hour often. The last several times we've been disappointed. We recently brought guests. They brought one bowl of chips for 6 people and 20 minutes later I had to ask for someone to wait on us. We were there again this week and we had the same issue. It took forever to give a drink order and forever to get our check. It's like they totally forget about us. It's odd because it's 4:30 and only a few people are there. We rotate going to happy hour at all the restaurants. I think Inferno is off the list for a while.
