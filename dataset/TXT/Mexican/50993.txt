92lt0pzWl8RRZiPCikDUpA Let's start this off with the fact that good ol Don Tortaco is walking distance from my house. I need to state that to explain why I frequent the place so much when I'm too lazy to go further. 

That being said, there is nothing about this place that particular stands out as a noteworthy. I mean, don't get me wrong... The food is good. But that's just it... It's good. Not great. Not amazing. No orgasmic. It's good. The stuff falls under the same ranking. For the most part, they're pretty all right. I mean I've had moments with some of them getting an attitude if my order is particular, but for the most part they're alright.  

I wish I had better things to say, but it is probably exactly what you would expect from the outside looking in. It's a step above Taco Bell at the end of the day. Wait... Prices are good though. I can say that at least. If nothing else, the price is right?

Take this, and do what you will.
