yZ0Ly75hbFx7M-9vDzrS4g It took 15+ minutes for the eight people ahead of me to place their order. I placed my order, out of product. Quoted 5 more minutes, at minute 3 mark I quickly realized it's wasn't going to happen. Slow service! Charged the wrong price; the staff was unwilling to correct the issue. Cafe Rio is excellent on the East side; this location falls completely short of expectations!!

Update: Steve, the manager, contacted me. He explained how the restaurant was short handed that day. I'm willing to give it a second go. I'll update my review after the next visit. Thank you Steve for the quick response.
