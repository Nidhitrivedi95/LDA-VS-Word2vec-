JsCKeWHA8n_5mFQ3F6t4UA It's good cheesy American-style Mexican good.  Think El Torito, Don Pablo, or Acapulco, but double the price and slightly better.

I've given it two stars for the price/quality as compared to other better Mexican places in Las Vegas.  Vegas has both amazing and crappy food, this is in the middle.
