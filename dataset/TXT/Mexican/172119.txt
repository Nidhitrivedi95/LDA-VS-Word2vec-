mB_cI1tCrNxxvr2e2myNrQ I was really excited to check this place out since I saw a video of it online a few months ago. My favorite part of this place was the Baja blast slushee (Baja blast with rum)! It was so good. There was also the usual food choices; however, I felt like everything wasn't super fresh. If I need some late night munchies in Vegas, I'd still drop by again.
