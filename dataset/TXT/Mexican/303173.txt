zY_YAwo4On0aqOABS-1cBA We were hungry and hoofing it in a hurry back to Bally's for the Price is Right show so we decided to grab a quick bite at this spot on the way. This place follows the Chipotle concept- pick a burrito, tacos or burrito bowl and meat then stack it with rice, salsa and veggies. The prices are reasonable and service was quick and friendly. They had only been open for 2 days but it seems their prime location brings them a good amount of patrons. The food was okay compared to Chipotle. The carne asada was good, shredded beef ok, chicken was a little bland. I liked their mild corn salsa. The one advantage this place has over Chipotle is the have shrimp (for $1 more).
