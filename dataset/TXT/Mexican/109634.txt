fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg Overpriced!!!!!! You pay for the name, he should take a break from his shows to visit his own disaster of a restaurant. The "borracho beans" taste like they came out of a generic off brand can of beans. I  figured they are called borracho because you have to be drunk to eat them and actually enjoy. I have never been utterly more disappointed, I would of rather went to Mcdonalds. Will never return!!!!
