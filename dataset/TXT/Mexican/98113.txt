ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA This past Friday night was my first, but will not be my last visit.  It's very difficult to find a restaurant that has genuine service and exquisite cuisines.  Ocotillo has both.   The most memorable part of the experience, aside from the food, was the very customer centered service from Amber.  The one notable aspect of the meal experience was that they let me eat, in peace, without those utterly annoying constant checkups.  I highly recommend this location and know you will love it!!!!
