I came here on a Friday night for dinner.  Every time I looked, there was always a line up but it moved rather quickly.  I ordered a Baja Fish and Chicken Tinga taco.  It was nice that the tacos came with a side of tortilla chips.  This place has a salsa bar and multiple rows of hot sauce.  I also ordered a serving of Mexican Street Corn.  The loved the interior decor and the vibe this restaurant gave.  I can't wait to come back!
