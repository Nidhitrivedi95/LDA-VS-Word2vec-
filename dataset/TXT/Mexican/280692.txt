XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg We had a 10pm reservation and were seated promptly and were greeted with happy anniversary wishes. My wife had the rubbed filet with the double baked potato. I had the pork filet with a corn dish on the side. The seasonings and flavors complimented the meat. The house margarita was outstanding as was the pomegranate martini.
Service was attentive and allowed for a relaxing dinner. 
We highly recommend for your next trip to Las Vegas.
