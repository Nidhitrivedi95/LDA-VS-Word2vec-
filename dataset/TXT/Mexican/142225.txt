jdaqp6fW0TqP2TdHatB7Pw Our experience was similar to the one Swank S. had below.  It was our first time at El Tango, we came in and found our own seat.  After sitting for about 5 minutes, we were told there is no wait service, we have to order at the counter.  My fiancee and I both ordered burritos grande, a beef and pork.  My fiancee requested no beans, but the guy taking our order said, the beans make the burrito, so he got the beans.  We ordered a side of chips and salsa and then two margaritas.  The guy said he would bring our drinks out and deliver our food to our table when it was ready.

And then we waited.  And waited.  We waited for about 15 minutes for drinks.  And these weren't normal margaritas.  They tasted as if they were carbonated with ginger ale or sprite in them, with little to no actual liquor.  And then we waited another 15 to 20 minutes for the chips and salsa.  Wait for CHIPS!?  They should have a huge bucket of these all prepared, ready to go!  When we got the chips, they were fresh and hot with three choices of salsa, but not worth the half hour wait and not worth the $5.50 price tag.  And then we waited some more, about 20 more minutes for our burritos.  And then I could see why they said the beans made the burrito, because it was practically all beans!  It was hard to find any meat whatsoever.  So they make no effort to try to entertain special requests so they can get away with giving you more  cheap ingredients.  I could have gotten that same burrito at Chipotle, with much faster service, there was nothing special about it.

The bill was over $40, for very simple food, everything was way overpriced.  I will probably never go back, as there are other places with better Mexican food and faster service.
