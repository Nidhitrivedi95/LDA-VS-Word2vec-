6LVadHqqjWlVnd-T7gAZyA Food is average. Nothing to brag about. The supreme fajita was very good but the onions and peppers were burnt. I had the beef fajita was so chewy and rubbery I sent it back and didn't eat(I've only done that one other time in my life). My wife ordered the  Margarita and was told it was only 1/2 price  in the bar ( witch was on the other side of the wall)and tasted like it sat in a frozen machine all day. Very disappointed
