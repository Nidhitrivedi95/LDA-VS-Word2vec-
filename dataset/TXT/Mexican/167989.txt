lv5Bnqlt93NnvNJ2oNcQ8Q I'm very sad to leave 1 star but here is my reasoning. After 3 trips to this restaurant, food was great and service was even better every time. However tonight I ordered chicken fajitas and as I was eating I took a bite that had steel wire in it from what appeared to be a dishwashing brush. I notified the manager and he handled it the best he could but something like this can't be forgotten. Hours later I can still feel the pain in my mouth.
