d_L-rfS1vT3JMzgCUGtiow Came here for a brunch outside the normal omelette and croissant fare and was very satisfied. We opted for the small plates brunch, and the waitress chose our first items. Corn tamale and tres leches French toast are not to be missed. The staff was attentive, friendly, and provided great suggestions of other items to try. Finish your meal off with churro tots and a mango mimosa.
