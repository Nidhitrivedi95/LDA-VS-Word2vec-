pomGBqfbxcqPv14c3XH-ZQ We tried Let's and this restaurant did not disappoint we ordered the tamales the Mexican shrimp cocktail the poppers which were hot to trot, we ordered the Mediterranean dish which included mussels clams and the lobster with fish and shrimp, our meals did not disappoint we ordered margaritas which were amazing. At the end of our meal we stayed for dessert the Ambiance was beautiful we ordered the sopapillas and the churros we had our 12 year old son with us. I give leticias a five-star the food did not disappoint we will definitely be going back. Our waitress was amazing the staff was very nice and helpful and we're attentive. Thank you for a beautiful meal.
