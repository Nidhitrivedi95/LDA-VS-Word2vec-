L2iT7pipc455Tgpbo35_mw I was so excited to try this place until I walked in. First of all, no one greeted us or said hello. My friend and I were awkwardly stared at by the staff as we sat ourselves. We then waited at our table for 15 minutes before having to get up and asked to be served. When the waitress finally came to our table I was shocked at how little she knew about the food. When she came back with our food we had to find our own plates and silverware. To top it all of the food was horrible and over priced. So disappointed in this place. I do not recommend it to anyone who is looking for a a decent dining experience.
