ZCe93zAkxr2KOBU1NT0lmg My work surprised us with lunch from this location. It is more similar to American-Mexican than authentic Mexican food. However, it was very good and rich in color. I peaked at the bill and it was very affordable. Would certainly recommend their party platters for large groups and will try a lunch special in the future.
