QhJT2fro3Dp1AaIVY7pgzQ The carnitas tacos were somewhat flavorful  the salsa is fresh but bland (watered down) Amy had the hard shell tacos and said they were soggy. Service was poor (not much English spoken and the person who took my order was on a personal phone call the whole time I was there).
Don't think I will be returning.
