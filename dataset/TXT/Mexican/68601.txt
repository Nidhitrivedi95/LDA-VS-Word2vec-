bMSiHjs2fbKbBNPyuTwhHA Service is poor. Lots of servers and bartenders milling about but no urgency to serve customers. Ordered soft shell crabs which were sodium laden! No spices. Just salt. Chef came to the table to apologize and said he would make them without all of the salt.....still insanely salty. Server placed dirty dishes from next table on ours as she was clearing it (throws up in hand). Just not a good dining experience. Drinks are hit or miss. Great view, poor service and marginal food. Street corn used to be great, but you can see the shortcuts they're taking since opening. And you have to pay parking to boot. AVOID
