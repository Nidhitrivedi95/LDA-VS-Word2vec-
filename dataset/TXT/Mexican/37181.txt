5pxRAyPz1PrW2amW7yYaxA After reviewing the menu, my friend and I decided to share a trio of Tacos w/ Carnitas (Slow-Cooked Pork), Al Pastor (Spicy Adoba Pork), and Carne Asada (Marinated Grilled Steak). We loaded them up with onion, pico de gallo, black beans, lettuce, cilantro, and fresh limes on the side. Guacamole is included with tacos, but if you can believe it, they forgot. Fortunately, we were dining in and I remembered after we sat down, so I was given a side of guacamole to compensate. Anyway, the tacos were just okay. The flavors of all the proteins just seemed a little off and none of the options were entirely appetizing. However, we also tried the Chronic Fries w/ Pollo Asado (Marinated Grilled Chicken) and enjoyed it. This is their version of loaded fries or more familiarly, "Carne Asada Fries" (though for this dish, only Carne Asada is extra $). The fries held up well and the toppings were good as the chicken tasted much better than our other protein options. Though I was not impressed with the tacos and subsequently not expecting much from their other menu selections, the Chronic Fries were good enough that if I had a hankering for loaded fries, I would consider a trip back for them.
