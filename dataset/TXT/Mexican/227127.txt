s0GeAnaUENWb2xAn_6EX-Q Mom and pop shop two dollar tacos down the street? Yes yes yes.
I ordered the pork tacos and was really impressed. If I had had more change on me I would have gotten an horchata too while I was at it. I have no doubts however that it's delicious.
I'm actually concerned that I'll just stop cooking and live off of tacos and churros now. Worse things have happened, I guess.
Very much a hole-in-the-wall type deal and absolutely worth it.

Heads up: it's cash only for the time being.
