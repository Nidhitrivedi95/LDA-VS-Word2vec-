MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA love their tacos! got their pork belly, chorizo, baja fish and octopus el diablo.

everything had a great taste of flavour. i'm not a fan of onions and cilantro which they put too much of it in but that's just my personal taste. their taco wrap was a little too small, i wished it was bigger so i can wrap all the toppings. my favourite was the chorizo and octopus.

luckily i didn't have to wait for a seat as i arrived relatively early. they have very limited seating, i had to sit at the bar.
