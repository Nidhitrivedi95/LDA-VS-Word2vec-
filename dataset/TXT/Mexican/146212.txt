JJe0yIYC_M3la1Qbm9i3UQ Great beer, cheap food, good times :)  Kind of in a bad area of town though... so just a watch out.  The menu is usually only a single type of item for the night (tacos, wings, etc.) so don't expect many options.  I usually go for Tacos which are amazing... lots of interesting tacos above and beyond basic beef and chicken.

The place seems to be hit or miss in terms of the crowd.  I've seen it packed to the brim.. but then i'v also seen it virtually empty.  When it gets busy the service REALLY slows down (even for basic things like Taco's or wings) but normally pretty quick/normal service.
