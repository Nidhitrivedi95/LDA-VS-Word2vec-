WpI5MZC3XzlTpcUOKXzCbA We went for dinner and had the taquitos and beef tacos. When they brought our plates the waiter warned us that the taco plate was extremely hot and not to touch. The tacos were so hot it was obvious that they either microwaved them or they sat under a heat  lamp for a good amount of  time. The taquitos came out and the plate was not hot at all and the taquitos were barely warm. The only thing that was warm on the taquito plate was the sour cream! gross.. our waiter was nice but that is not enough for us to return. I really wish this place was good because we haven't been able to find a great mexican food place in Vegas yet.
