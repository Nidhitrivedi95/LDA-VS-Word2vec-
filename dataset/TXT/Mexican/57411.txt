a8pmtlVKf7NiSLI-4KejIw I would give this 3.5 but apparently no half stars allowed. The food was delicious and the service was great. A lot of people seem to complain that the sizes are small and the price is high. I would look at this for what it is. It is really a tapas bar. Sizes are small because you are meant to share. Prices are high because the food is good. If you want a cheap taco go to Taco Bell. I had a swordfish taco and a tortilla soup for $23 and left full. Looking fwd to going back in the summer. The patio is great.
