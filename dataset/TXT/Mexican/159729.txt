kWItkhjHRuzfC11CP1E0ZQ This restaurant was a gem.  It was fabulous to feel like I was eating real food that was well thought out and attractively displayed.  It was far superior to the usual Mexican fare.  It felt more like you had been invited over for dinner to someone's home, especially when the family/ owners sat down at a table near us to have their evening meal during a slow period.
I had the carna assada with onions which was very flavorful.  It was served with a side of cactus and a grilled pepper in addition to rice and beans.  My husband had the Lalo's Special which he couldn't stop talking about.  Our daughter ordered tacos with rice and beans.  My husband took a bite of her taco and just said, "wow."
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone, but especially those who love real food and a cozy setting.
