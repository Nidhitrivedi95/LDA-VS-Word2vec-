UODskmUq92u6d2SH5MaO6Q Stopped by this place on Labor Day around noontime because I was craving a Carne Asada burrito. I wanted to try this place out as I have never been before. The place was clean and there were only two ladies talking about life issues who seemed to be enjoying the food. Walked up to the counter and the lady there was very friendly. I took a look at their menu board and saw what I had came for but
another item grabbed my attention.  It was a taco with coconut shrimp with mango Pico de Gallo ($3.89). I had to try it. FIVE STARS on this one. It was so good. The coconut shrimp was breaded nicely and the shrimp was firm and pleasant. There was no soggyness just loads of flavor. See the pics, yum. The carne asada was good ($7.19), but after having that coconut shrimp taco, everything else in my book at that  point took a back seat. I will definitely be back. Hope you all will give this a try as well.
