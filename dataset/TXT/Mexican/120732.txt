h-Oq86DZfZad9kKXe8m7Lg While the food here was pretty tasty, my tacos in particular being very good. My problem here, is that the tacos only had a suggestion of meat filling, and the prices are kinda silly high for what you're getting. I did try a second visit, and ordered a carne assada burrito for lunch, the burrito was about half the size I expected to receive. To me it doesn't matter if you have delicious food, if I'm still a kind of hungry when I leave. Overall pretty underwhelmed.
