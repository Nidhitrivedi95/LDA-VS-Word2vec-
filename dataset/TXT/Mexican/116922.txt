gldPX9ANF5Nic0N7igu2og I was really rooting for you guys since this is only feet away from my work. The food was bland and didn't have much of an "authentic" flavor.... or even any flavor at all. I ordered three tacos and they were heavily stuffed and I couldn't even begin the eat the third once (which I guess the portion is the only good thing). The price isn't too bad but there isn't much meat for $4-$5 per taco. I wish that it didn't taste like beans from a can and instant rice.



I went back again for their happy hour. On the front page of their website it stated that happy hour was from 4-7pm (it has now been updated) but I arrived at 4:35pm and the server would not honor it. He said that happy hour started at 5... I order chips and queso for my group. The chips tasted burnt and the queso was again bland as expected. The margaritas were decent but our server took about 15 minutes to bring each out for a member of our group when there were only 5 people... the place was busy but it's such a small place that busy means 30 people all together.
