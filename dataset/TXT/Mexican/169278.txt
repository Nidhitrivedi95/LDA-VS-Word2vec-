lWmDrnqgU6w3gFaJyn_1Uw I went here for dinner, and was really impressed. The evening atmosphere is really nice, I got there around 9 and there were candles on the tables. The server was super nice and attentive, my water glass was full the whole night. He answere dall our questions about sizes of dishes as well.

I got the Briar Patch cocktail which was really good, and looked pretty. Very fruity with nice quality alcohol. I got the VIeras which are seared scallops on risotto cake with whipped goat cheese and arugula. I got the portion with 2 scallops which was SO filling! The scallops were perfectly seared and not chewy at all and the whipped goat cheese is a game changer, so good. 

My friend got the paella negra, which comes in a good portion. It isn't incredibly spiced, but the squid ink is really rich. There is also a really good amount of seafood (shrimp, a nice scallop, squid) and well cooked rice. Overall really pleasant dining experience!
