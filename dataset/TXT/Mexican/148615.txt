jScBTQtdAt-8RshaiBEHgw I usually do not write reviews.   However, since this place took FOREVER to bring us our food.   I figured I use this time to say how S...L...O...W  this place is.    We have been sitting here for an hour waiting and waiting.   I really don't know about the food but the wait is HORRIBLE.  We FINALLY received our food and one of the dishes was cold. Had to send it back.  It wasn't the waitresses fault. They did the best they could. I am a business owner so it is always sad to see a business doing so bad.    I hope the owner get to read this review and make improvements.    Maybe less waitresses and more cooks.    I WOULD NOT go back to this place.
