Ks9nrEuLdjmrLH9uXz_G8A The food is good, don't get me wrong about it, but the service was SO freakin slow!!! One guy was doing everything, while the other people were just walking around not doing anything!!! The line was getting backed up, and the best part is, I spent 20 of my 30 min lunch over there and had to eat my burrito on the way back to work. I didn't even get to enjoy my lunch and the burrito because I had to basically stuffed it down into my body!!! I won't be going to this location again until their service is quicker. Go to the Val vista and baseline one, service is quicker, and more better.
