xlXwxfiUD4bgJFKUYwkzOg I agree with Topher.  We drove down for the grand opening that was advertised online and on a flyer we received in the mail to find out there was a private party of about 12 people (if that) until 7pm and then the restaurant was "fully committed" until 10p.  However complimentary shots of tequila were offered at Drop Bar across the casino floor-too little, too late. We decided to go to Hank's across the way...even though they are often busy, they never disappoint.
