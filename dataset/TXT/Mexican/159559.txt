kUICYu0N_TbtCz0Z8ynPFw Chipotle is your typical upscale mexican fast-food-burrito joint. Wait in line (which during peak lunch/dinner times can have you waiting for at least 10 minutes), specify what ingredients you want, then bam, ready to go. If you simply get a burrito, the price is great for a typical lunch break, but toss in many of the other options and soon your price will be cringe-worthy. The burritos are decently sized and will fill your appetite as well. 

The atmosphere is loud with the music playing combined with the 20+ customers typically present, but with available upstairs seating (which has a great view I might add), personal space is easy to come by. The finish and decor are stylish and well maintained.

While Chipotle doesn't really stand out to my taste buds, its a satisfying fall-back option for lunch when I'm pondering "hm, what should I have today?" They deliver consistently good burritos and combined with a great location, it is a frequently stop on my list.
