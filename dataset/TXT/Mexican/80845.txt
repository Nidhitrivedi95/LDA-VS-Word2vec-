CZhc8YXdFLhAI4ViC2ERTg LOVE this food!!! I've been 3 times and had delivery once and not one thing was less than good. Literally each item I've tried - I wish I could remember them all. The margaritas are great, especially the cucumber jalapeno one!  The service is pretty good, they seem slow but the timing/pacing of drinks/chips/appetizers/entree is actually awesome. There's always time for each "course" and room to breathe between. 

The bean dip and salsa and grilled peppers and onions are REALLY GOOD!!  It's super easy to just fill up on these!! But save room for the fried tortilla dessert they always bring. It's so good!!!!
