4Pb7SlTK89uSdqOwMNM35A Well thank God for Tequila Taqueria. We were a group of 8 that stumbled in after a long night of partying. We were celebrating my fiancées birthday and wanted to eat at a fun and upbeat place. Nailed it with Tequila Taqueria. We blew by the host and kinda sat ourselves...ooops. Andi was quick to sarcastically point out our mistake. At this point we knew we were at the right place. Andi read us the riot act before cracking a smile and introduced us to another server named Kristin.  We told them we were in town to celebrate and they knew just what we needed. A third server named Cindy brought out what seemed like an endless amount of pitchers of margaritas with a huge smile on her face. These three servers ganged up on us and worked flawlessly together. Andi didn't ask us what we wanted to eat..she told is what we were going to eat! Kristin had us laughing the entire time while Cindy made sure everything was absolutely perfect. After we finished eating we were about to ask for the check but Kristin beat us to the punch. Not before Andi and the bartender brought out a special birthday shot for my fiancée. We felt spoiled the entire visit and when Cindy sang Happy Birthday as we walked out we knew we were coming back. Oh yeah, we're coming back all right.
