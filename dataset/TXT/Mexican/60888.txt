aqTdhZDTSjA42_Uh2E6V7A I went here every weekend for most of the summer. We are always looking for deals and for a while (sadly no longer) they had 99 cent tacos and tamales, and I was in pregnant lady heaven.
I do think 1.90 a taco is a little pricey, it's not outrageous, and we are willing to pay. Cilantro, lettuce, tomato, lime, perfect.
Their enchiladas are simple and delicious.
We also have enjoyed their fajitas and the beans and rice were very tasty.
I did not enjoy my steak burrito, personally, it lacked veggies and was basically beans and steak. Very heavy, pretty boring.
I love that they have a variety of hot sauces and they are all very fresh tasting.
I am very thankful for this restaurant, it is hard to find good Mexican food in town.
