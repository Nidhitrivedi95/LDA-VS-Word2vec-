iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg Best fish tacos I've ever had. This place really made me fall in love with fish tacos, which I never really cared for before. Their ceviche is a pretty big portion, and tastes very fresh. I have to be honest I don't remember the other two tacos I got since this is a very delayed review, but trust me you will not be disappointed. Try to get there before the lunch time rush so you won't have to wait too long. Their home made drinks were both very refreshing and tasty. Can't wait to go back!
