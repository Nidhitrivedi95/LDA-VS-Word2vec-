A nice Airport restaurant with a decent menu. I can't fully review this restaurant as we were only served drinks.

The margaritas were good, not the best I've ever had but they held their own. Prices were ok, for being a Terminal restaurant, pricey for other standards. We were seated quickly and the hostess was nice. Our server came to the table some time later and we ordered two margaritas. My wife ordered the pink one and I ordered the spicier one, can't remember the names of them now as its been a few weeks.

The restaurant was busier so it took alittle time to receive our drinks and the server was ok. After we got our drinks our server went on her break, which isn't a problem at all, but the server that took over for her was absent. I mean, we never saw him/her. We would have had another round but after waiting 30 minutes with no server even after hitting the call button on the table we finally hit the Payment button. Still, no server, we finally had to wave another server down just to get our bill.

Overall I could do without going back to this spot, though the margaritas were good they aren't worth the wait.
