d4qwVw4PcN-_2mK2o1Ro1g Excellent service and good food prior to a show at The Hard Rock. Huge serving sizes you could really share. We ordered the avocado and tomato salad, chicken posole, stuffed jalopenos wrapped in bacon, and both the chicken and steak nachos. We could not eat all the nachos. They were so good but enough to stuff 2 off on plate.
