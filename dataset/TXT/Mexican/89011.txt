dODimuyIJGIxER5uzX5WuQ I've been here multiple times. My boyfriend loves this place. I like it because this is the closest Mexican food that I have found near by, that is close to our home town Santa Maria CA. Every time I go I feel like it's over priced, but I don't mined because it's always good. But tonight I got a "BLACK HAIR" in many Quesadilla. Not cool for how much I pay, won't go back.
