Cd2ERofxOeCbCi-0yDs0aw Yummy!!!!  The green chili here is AMAZEBALLS!  We ordered fry bread with green chili, no refried beans (normally comes with it).  The green chili was the best I've had in the valley and the fry bread was cooked to perfection.  We also had a bean and cheese fry bread and it was great too.  The folks here took great care of us.  I tried the enchiladas too and they were tasty.  I want to come back and try new things.  Definitely worth a visit!
