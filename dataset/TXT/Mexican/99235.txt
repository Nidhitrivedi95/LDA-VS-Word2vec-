eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg My 100th review! I waited for something truly epic to come along. Here it is. The Barrio Cafe! I drove up to see my bio dad and his wife. They decided to meet at the cafe because they said that they have the best food ever. I was skeptical because I practically live in Mexico, so who has the best food? Tucson has the best food! Just kidding. 

I get there and they're packed at 2pm. That's saying something. We had some somewhat slow service, but the guy was super nice so I'm not docking anything. 

We get the guacamole first. It has  pomegranate in it or something like that. What?!?! No. This was the best dang guac ever. I mean ever. I ordered the carne asada tacos. It was served with fries and two very unique sauces that I didn't think to ask about. My step mom had this cheese stuff and this corn stuff. I had a bite of the corn and it was incredible. The tacos were awesome. 

We had an excellent visit. This was a perfect choice in dining for the occasion. We did end up putting our lady Guadalupe on the floor because we needed more room for food. I'm definitely not religious, but I hit a huge traffic jam on the way home. Next time Lady Guadalupe can stay on the table I guess. I give this place a million stars. One million. 

I'm coming to Phoenix for training next month. I'm ready to gain some weight! I hope you're ready for me Barrio folks!
