Jd2NUZeVeyWi1tTNKXMt1Q I brought some friends from NM and they totally loved it. Corina was our server and she was awesome! This is a Friday night at 7 pm and she was super busy yet treated us like we were her only table. The chips and salsa also came with green chile, beans and sour cream sauce. So delicious. I had stuffed sopapillas with medium red chile. They were so good, with ground beef, red chile and rice and beans. I think they could've used some fresh lettuce but were fantastic nonetheless. Mom had the same with spicy green chile and absolutely ate her entire plate. My friend had a combo plate with a flauta, taco and enchilada. She loved all of it smothered in green chile. Nothing special about the margs but we really loved the food.
