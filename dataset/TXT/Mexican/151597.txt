jUQmWbY3KSCyxvsKJmPJPQ This locally owned restaurant is awesome, but the well known McKellips Road location in Mesa is closed due to a fire and lease problems from what I have learned. A totally different restaurant now operates at the McKellips location under a "similar name". Do NOT be fooled, it is not the same restaurant. HOWEVER Rancho de Tia Rosa's has another location at Higley and Guadalupe in Gilbert. The same food, same owners, awesome awesome awesome....... AND a new Taqueria is being opened at Greenfield and Brown. Renovation is under way. I drive by it every day. So a new location to open soon!! YAY!!!! The Sirrine family's Mexican food is not your typical mexican food. The recipes are awesome. You simply must experience it for yourself. We have never had a dish there that we did not like. We have eaten there at least once a month since they opened their McKellips location and used to eat at the FIRST restaurant from time to time too. So this review is not based on just one visit. We are hooked!
