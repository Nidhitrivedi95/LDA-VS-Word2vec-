6XpqswYWoSOx0a9MkosVRA We went for lunch on a Saturday. Great place! You can tell everything is made fresh. We had guacamole ($), plus their chips w/house bean dip and salsa as an appetizer and all are phenomenal. 
Entrees were off the lunch menu, a combo platter and two chicken tacos. The chicken tacos were a recommendation from the waitress and OMG, what a delicious recipe. It's a passed-down family recipe! 
For drinks, I had a margarita and my husband had a mojito. The margarita was delicious. The mojito recipe needs a little tweaking as it was lacking in mint/Yerba. Nonetheless , we will definitely be a repeat customer to try other items on the menu (or just keep ordering the same!)
