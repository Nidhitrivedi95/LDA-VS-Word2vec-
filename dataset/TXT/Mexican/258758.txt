vnIdWzIB2W4j9cDcd6tHAQ Came here as part of the TD Jazz Festival last night. They had a nice set up with the bad playing in the front, and you can munch and drink while listening to them. 

Only got a drink and some dessert, but seems like they serve Mexican food and might be a good alternative to Playa Cabana Cantina across the street. The question is, is the food good and authentic? Maybe. Menu has tacos and burritos among other things. 

But the Sangria was really good. A little pricey at $6, but a good sized portion and glass size. It wasnt super sweet where it tastes like juice, and had real fruit. Seems like they make it , not from syrup. We also got fresh churros for $2 each Super crispy, but a little thick on the dough - it was still good with condensed milk drizzled on top. 

I wasn't super impressed, but I definitely might give it a try again if craving mexican food.
