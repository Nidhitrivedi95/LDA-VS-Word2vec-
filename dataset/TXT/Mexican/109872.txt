fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg Overpriced!!  Got the street corn on the cob which was good, nothing spectacular, but it was $10.  Then 3 street steak tacos, which again were good, $19.  Service was very good and the free chips n salsa they give u were excellent!  Paid close to 3x as much of any other mexican place
