WVzCMOvn9MnEwTC20GmIWg Agreed with most other Yelpers. Opt for another restaurant if you can. Ordered the Dinner for Two; guacamole with chips (OK), molletes de chorizo (definite pass), and 4 tacos (chicken, pork, fish, steak). Everything ranged from OK to "these tacos all taste the same". The restaurant itself is nice, and the neighborhood needs a few more restos but this is not what we were hoping for. We will not be back.
