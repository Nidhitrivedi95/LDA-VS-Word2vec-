MmQsPiVSN08WtmlsC_ZSVA I went here based on other people telling me it is really good. I was not impressed. We ordered online and went to pick it up, which I think was the first issue. Our order was wrong. They forgot out churros and gave use the wrong salsa. My taco was cold. We got a steak bowl that the only good thing was the steak.  I got an empanada which was good. It was the best part. The chips in my opinion are better than Chipotle's, but doesn't make up for the small portions. Based on the other reviews I assume consistency is the issue with this place. For the same price I can get more food at Chipotle and I don't have to worry about service or quality.
