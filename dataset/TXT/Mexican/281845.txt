XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg My husband & I always eat here when we come to Vegas, we are obsessed with the port tenderloin sandwich (which is delicious). Our experience today will probably be our last. Once we were seated it took 6 minutes for us to be greeted & by greeted I mean we received a drink menu & he said he would be back to take our drink order. My husband & I really didn't need anytime because we already knew what we wanted. It took our server at least 10 minutes to return for even just our drink order. We decided to order our food as well. Another 15 minutes go by & sure enough our food & drinks come out at exactly the same time. Let me also mention that 2 double bloody Mary's will be charged as if you ordered 4 bloodys Mary's which is a complete rip off. Our server was obviously overwhelmed as tables around us were having to flag him down as well as bussers passing by. It's really unfortunate that the service is so crappy. Especially for the money spent & how much my husband and I look forward to coming here.
