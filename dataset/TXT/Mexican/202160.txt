PndkxtLCDv69LBE5Ay8Mwg Unlike our first visit late last year, our dinners were barely passable, with the fajita beef in the burritos so chewy that we could not consume some of it. We waited over 50 minutes after ordering for simply two burritos, and we noticed that most everyone seemed to be served very slowly. The waitresses were not attentive to refill drinks. I was disappointed with my food and will reconsider returning to this place.
