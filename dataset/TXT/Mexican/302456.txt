zwNC-Ow4eIMan2__bS9-rg If you are looking for Al Pastor tacos, this is the place to go! Hands down the best in town. The other tacos aren't too shabby either, but if you don't get the adobada (al pastor) you are wasting your time here. And that is the reason that you see my four stars: the other tacos are just ok and the burritos are just mediocre. I have not tried their other offerings so my four stars are based on the tacos and burritos. But honestly, why would you go to a place called Taco y Taco if you aren't getting tacos...
