9d7N-I00hu-VkXFry4Da-g Previously liked this place a lot, but the last few visits have really bombed. Most recently, a couple days ago. 

Here's the thing, this place is currently undergoing some major construction. There are no signs indicating the place is even open, let alone where to go since the front door is basically a disaster area of blasted asphalt and bare bones concrete blocks.

That said, these folks should be thanking the HEAVENS anyone is walking into their establishment.

So my recent visit went like this: Me, my Dad and my Aunt came in for lunch. Jesus was our server. Dad asked for the mini-chimi appetizer. I order a chicken burrito with fundido and verde sauce. No beans, just rice please.

Dad gets a full sized chimichanga, whilst my order is not only missing verde, but the rice. My order goes back once they realize the mistake...they bring it back, only now with rice still missing. Dad meanwhile realizes he's got the wrong item too.

Brought the issue up with Jesus, who is clearly irritated and has the audacity to argue that my Dad ordered from the lunch menu. Thing is, I saw him point to the chimi on the appetizer section when he ordered. Wrong answer, Jesus.

Service was so rude, I'd be reluctant to return to this place ever again.

Word to the wise: Get the attitude in check, Jesus. Don't blame the customer for your ordering errors... especially when people like us are willing to dine in your very dusty dining room as your establishment undergoes construction.
