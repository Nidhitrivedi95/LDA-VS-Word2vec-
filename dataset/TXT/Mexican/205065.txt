pup46G8qFBG8695RtbQNwA The food at Los dos has always been fantastic, last time I went I got a Christmas chimi and dear god. Their drinks are great too, margaritas are fantastic, micheladas are ridiculous. That being said, service was the WORST. To be honest I was unsure who our server was and not because there were several people coming by to check on us but because we literally saw him once and no one else could be bothered with our table (which was a damn shame because I wanted to indulge in a few more drinks). He was blasé as hell when taking our order and that was it, gone, much like the wind. The poor busser/SA who came by to clear our table got the brunt of my colleagues rage after we had waited (and I counted) 18 minutes for the check. Wanting to diffuse the situation I told the people I was with to wait in the car and I would take care of the bill, after waiting another 7 minutes (and desperately trying to flag down literally any server in the vicinity) I went inside to the hostess to ask her to send my server over so I could pay. 
I talked to a friend about this location and he told me he had similar experiences in more recent times as ownership had changed a bit there. Bummer, but I hear the other locations are better.
