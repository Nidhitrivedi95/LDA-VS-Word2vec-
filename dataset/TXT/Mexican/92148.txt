e0CehK0lUWqd530L4-ni3A First time here and I will not by going back. I got 2 carne asada tacos and a side of beans to go. If I am ordering brand to go you would think they would be put in a separate container. Nope! Beans everywhere they were all over my taco and by the time I got home my taco was soggy. To top it off the taco didn't have any flavor. And they don't even give you a lime for your tacos.
