Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ We went here twice for breakfast. The first morning we were really happy to see they served brunch till 2:30p on a Sunday morning and the second time we were late again for breakfast service but they said they had no problem serving it to us at noon.
My husband loved the blueberry pancakes and I enjoyed their chicken with Quinoa. The second morning we enjoyed the pancakes again and their lox on a bagel was really tasty.
The food is delicious and we would go back.
