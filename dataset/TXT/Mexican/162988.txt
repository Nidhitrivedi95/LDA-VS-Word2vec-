LBBp51YHui5gvXNSyUcLKg This place has definitely gone downhill. It used to have the best Mexican food at a great price. We each ordered the fajitas which now cost $16, and we received a plate full of sautéed onions with 4-5 pieces of over cooked meat and a couple of strips of green pepper. Of course we got the usual pile of beans and rice, but we really felt ripped off. We are really disappointed that one of our favorite restaurants has lost its way!
