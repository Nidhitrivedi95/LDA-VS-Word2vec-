While the food isn't horrible, it's overpriced for what you get (both quality and quantity) - if it wasn't so expensive, I'd give the food 3 stars, as it is, 2 stars. Had one specialty drink, the one they make at your table (their website is currently not working for their margarita list) and was extremely underwhelmed. 

Service was good, but out of the numerous places my mother and I ate at this weekend in Scottsdale, this was by far our least favorite. Will not be back.
