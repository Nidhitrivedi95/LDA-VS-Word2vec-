3WRvQJS9GIBubGxbHMzX2g Tried it since the food poisoning scare. Prices up a bit. $1.95 for a little over a tablespoon of guacamole. Their getting stingy on their portions too. Lemonade wasn't as good as what I make at home. Still a burrito is filling but not hot. Just like warm. Won't be returning for awhile. I used to look forward to this location but it's changed.
