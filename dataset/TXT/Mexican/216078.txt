R1PQEK6qvrZVC9qcWfKvDA Hawaiian style chipotle 

Overall:

Recommended if you are in the mood for a new style of chipotle. The food is not amazing but it is good. 

Parking: 

Decent amount of parking. *5 stars*

Establishment: 

Decor was hawaiian themed. Service was good nothing to complain about. *5 stars*

Food: 

Burrito: I had the hula hula chicken and the kalua pork. It was pretty tasty but nothing amazing. *4 stars*

Coconut bark: Good but only had the sample size with the check-in. Reminded me of a almond crispy almond joy. *4 stars*
