pdTYUCGkYz35utxPyUMoag My star rating is solely based on the foood!! The food here is excellent! I have been to this place a few times now and the food has never been a disappointment! Always full of flavour and just super yummy !!! 

The drinks are real expensive and pretty small, so I will steer clear of those next time. 

But the main catastrophe happening here. Is the staff. I personally had an incredible waitress when I was dining. She was very informative and took the time to speak with us about the menu and the options and make sure that we were happy! But the people bringing the food were so rude !!!!! Almost like that "i'm a hipster and i'm way better than you are" vibe, yeah it was horrible you couldn't ask them questions unless you were ready to get a snippy answer!! When you walk in NO ONE GREETS YOU!!!!! The worst ! And these hostess's run by you and don't even acknowledge the fact that you're here, don't reply when you speak to them. It was overall immature, it's like there was 15, 25yr old to cool for school kids running the show making everyone feel like an inconvenience. 

Either way I'll put up with their garbage service for the food.
