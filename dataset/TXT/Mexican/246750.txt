TXjg3qtm6gjlbP8Iwsm4lQ I've never felt the desire to review chipotle because everyone knows what to expect. It's decent food prepared quickly, and usually consistent from location to location. This location, however, is the worst one I've ever visited. The staff was friendly and the long line moved at a crisp pace. The problem was the food. The chicken bowl I had was so salty that it was rendered inedible. I just dumped it in the trash and went next door to get a sandwich.   Clearly either the cook did not follow the recipe or he either inadvertently spilled the whole container of salt into the pan during the preparation process. Definitely steer clear of this location.
