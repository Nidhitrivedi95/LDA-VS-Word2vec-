TH_Vr8_LCnAXFDUqSkF-HA As a family in the neighborhood we've been to popo's for 40+ years, often walking there from home or after school. Something has changed in the past few years and this weekends visit is most likely my last. The service has slipped considerably. I work in a kitchen & understand being busy, but the server openly sneered at us when we asked for my son's water refill (for the 4th time!) Other servers and the host outright ignored us. This is a systemic failure, this isn't one person or one day, they have been getting worse for years and it's finally broken me. 
It's a shame because this is where we'd normally bring our out of town guests. I'll be checking yelp for their replacement.
