3IwCop28R1_L5jMv6AkL8Q I'd been wanting to try Jalisco for a while, and when I saw a Groupon for it I decided to try it. We went last night at around 5:30. 
It's a nice, cozy restaurant with a relaxed atmosphere. The food was delicious (ceviche appetizer, shrimp fajitas for me and chicken enchilada for my husband), and was served quickly, and our waitress was really sweet and attentive. 
I'd give it 5 starts if it wasn't for the hostess, though. She seemed annoyed that we came in. She didn't greet us, she didn't even say one word to us. When I came in she came out from the back of the restaurant where she was doing busy work, and looked at me without saying a word. I smiled and said "hi, 2 please". She grabbed the menus and started walking towards the tables. Again, no "follow me please" or "this way", nothing. 
She stopped at what I assumed was our table, took away the extra silverware, put the menus down, and walked away. No "enjoy your dinner", "here you go", "your server will be right with you", not even a "you're welcome" when I said "thank you". She literally said nothing and her body language made me wonder if I'd done something to offend her. Maybe she was having a bad day, but we all have bad days and suck it up when dealing with the public. 
So that kinda gave us a bad first impression. The food and our waitress made up for it, though. 
We'll be back, but probably not for a while. Hopefully by then grumpy hostess will be gone.
