IYpaW7h8aPYKIK84_ZKMIg Brought the hubs here for his birthday back in April.  I don't believe they had been open for too long and unfortunately it showed.  The saturday evening we ventured in, they weren't overly crowded or busy...service was subpar.  Our server was very personable and attentive when he wasn't serving more tables than I thought he should be...so maybe they were short staffed server wise that evening.  Drinks and food were great.  Chicken wings were spicy HOT but tastey.  Salsa was on point.  Its nice to have a mexican food option in downtown.
