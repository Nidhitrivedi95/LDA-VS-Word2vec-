7GGJlp1aWfcXGQz6q7SkXQ Very disappointed so far with my experience here. My husband, gf and I paid $50 a person to reserve seats for the game on Sunday. We came in right at 10 and we were told we could watch any game. We asked that the channel be changed for the Seahawks and they at first couldn't find it. 

We eventually found out we had to wait for the stupid game before it up end which had gone into OT. 

One would think that as a sports bar they would have the sports package on tv that would allow them to watch any game. 

Regardless we ordered bloody Mary's (horrible and chunky) and some food while waiting to watch our game. After missing the entire first quarter we finally got to see our game. 

Food came:  flavor flav chicken (3 stars), chips and guacamole (chips were stale), spinach artichoke dip(horrid), jalapeño poppers (so so)... and the topper, I ordered ice cream and they were out. I truly feel like this has been the biggest waste of my time and money since coming up Vegas. I will not be returning.
