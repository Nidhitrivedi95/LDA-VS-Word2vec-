VRwT0pscR5vESCrAnUpNwQ Love this place. The bulgogi taco and the corn on the cob was my fav. Friend ordered the cali burrito bowl and enjoyed it very much as well-couldn't finish it though (generous portion size). 

Was in the area for a four day class. Ended up coming here two days in a row for lunch. Would recommend you to get here before 11:30, as the area can get very busy on weekdays during lunch hours. If you are staying in during their lunch hours, then make sure to have a friend order and grab the sauces while the other grabs a table. 

If you do take out, dont forget to grab yourself a fork/ spoon.
