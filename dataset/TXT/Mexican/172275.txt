mB_cI1tCrNxxvr2e2myNrQ Now, first things first, you need to your base score for regular Taco Bell and multiply that by 2. If you think Taco Bell is garbage, 2 x 0 = 0 (proof left as exercise to reader).

But I am a guy who occasionally likes to "Live Mas." Put it simply, it's Taco Bell, but with margaritas and loud music. Now, when I went the DJ was pretty good. Better than say contemporary DJs like Calvin Harris. But that's because Calvin Harris quite simply isn't that good. I digress, but people started dancing in the Taco Bell lobby. That's impressive. Also everyone got a shout-out.

Don't go on a date unless your date is legally deaf, or if your date is Calvin Harris. I had a doubledilla and it eh pretty ok I guess.

6.5/10 would recommend
