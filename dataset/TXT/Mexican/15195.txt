1_y5e1u-o93EKOigXgR3LQ Man, I feel bad for giving this review, but I was pretty disappointed. This place has the nicest servers too.  

I bought two tacos and a water for $8 I believe.  My issue with this place is:

a) I wanted a healthy vegetarian taco.  The tofu was deep fried.
b) The toppings were pretty slim.  
c) I finished both tacos in 2 minutes total.  

I would have preferred if they put some beans or something else in it.  When I spend close to $10, I expect to be decently full, but I was so hungry afterwards, that I went to eat pizza right after.  

I'm sorry. :-(
