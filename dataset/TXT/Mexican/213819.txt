QwPt--ZmXlSHq_UhUYpIYw The food is good but the amount of food you get for the price is way way off!!! I paid over 3 dollars  for a street taco...you don't get Mexican food expecting French cuisine portions...you just dont...but that was my experience...the bad part of it is the food had great flavor! Making it hard to give a 3 star rating...
