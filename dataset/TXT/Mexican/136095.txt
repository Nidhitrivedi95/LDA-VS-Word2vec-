iOt7ebp4Zy-5YUjHL1rbmQ Warning: not open on Sundays. That was our first attempt to try Backyard Taco only to find they are closed all day Sunday. The parking lot is small and once the other business in the same complex open will be limited parking since this was the only place open so far and the parking lot was full. Street tacos were good and l liked the salsa bar.
