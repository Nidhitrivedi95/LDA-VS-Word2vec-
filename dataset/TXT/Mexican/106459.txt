fL2vdjn-ApNcsVntxtg4Dg Gamble here at your own risk! This is my third time staying here for a local event and this is the worst casinos I have been too. Most of the gamblers are local elderlys and I promise you NO ONE IS A WINNER!! The only good thing about this place is the $3 minimum black jack table. Slots are super tight and will eat your money. At other casinos I  usually win some lose some but my goodness.. you can literally go days at the Fiesta Henderson without getting a decent win. Stay here fine but gamble here and you will lose all your money in no time.
