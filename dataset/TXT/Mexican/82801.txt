For a nice looking upscale restaurant, they serve water and sauces in disposable cups and even supply plastic flatware, which I thought seemed out of place. The salsa and queso were way overpriced for the amount you're served in a small plastic ramekin. The tacos were on what seemed like store bought tortillas that were not cooked at all. We went during the Pirates game so there were only two occupied tables in the restaurant with at least 5 servers on duty, but we were still mostly neglected as ours was more interested in socializing with her coworkers and being on her phone at the bar.
