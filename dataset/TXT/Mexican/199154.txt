P8lGz3aiwedtGQWrifuBTA My wife and I ate there last night... First the good the Red Chili was quite good. 
The chips were stale- red sauce and beans with chips were bad and tastless.
the carne asada was OK the enchilada served with it was awful.
The 7 dollar margarita was made by someone who knew not what a marg. is.
This place is headed out.
