75vRgse6O3P4GL_vi3Xr9Q Was driving home with the wifey from a night out in Scottsdale. "Let's get some street tacos!" I said.  Quickly launched the Yelp app and came across this place.  Hmmmm, 4 and a half stars, pics look tasty, and jam packed. It must be good, right?  WRONG!!!!

This place is awful. I mean really really awful. Nothing we ate tasted good.  We had a chicken quesadilla, a steak quesadilla, a bean/cheese burrito, and asada tacos. They all sucked. The asada was bland and dry.  No salt at all.  Just charred pieces of meat.  The chicken was flavorless. The tortillas were stale. The bean and cheese burrito was an absolute disaster.  Please see the picture i posted.  No, that is not a plate of beans we ordered on the side.  That came out of 1/2 a burrito.  Bland, flavorless beans and some cheese wrapped in a greasy, half-ass-wrapped tortilla.  And who puts minced cabbage on steak tacos? The only taco that should have cabbage on it, is a fish taco. And the cabbage should be shredded, not pulverized.  The red sauce was not spicy at all, and lacked any kind of authentic Mexican flavor.  No condiments anywhere.  No variety of sauces, no radishes, no pickled jalapeños & carrots.  They just throw a couple of dried up lime wedges in your plate.  I saw a few people with some roasted jalapeños on their plate, but you have to specifically ask for it.

Quite possibly the worst taco joint I've ever been to.  The people who gave this place 5 stars should really get out more often.  This place is garbage.  Try PHX Burrito House down the street.  Much, MUCH better.  But those f***ers close early.  Or, for the best tacos and burritos in all of Phoenix, head over to Ta Carbon on 43rd near Thomas or on 59th near Camelback.

By the way, I ate there at 10:30.  I'm writing this review at 11:30...from my toilet!
