O_UC_izJXcAmkm6HlEyGSA I eat burritos like they're candy.
So to have a burrito placed in front of me that was so exquisitely sculpted, dressed, topped and stuffed - it would have felt like a crime to inhale it. I savoured every bite of the Carne Molida Picadillo burrito. Even the margarita I had was fresh and delicious. And looking around the table, it doesn't seem like you can go wrong with whatever you order.

The atmosphere, music, and servers all feel VERY authentically Mexican - and their amazing homemade salsa took me right back to every vacation I've ever taken down there.
