TrJvNiNo6yt2lfkSOc6E_w This is by far my families favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. Always fast service, delicious food & amazing margaritas! My sister in law and I always get chimichangas- I'll always get chimichangas here! I love the rice too! And our other FAVORITE item - the white queso dip! The salsa is excellent too.

I love Cozumel & can't wait to try their new Richfield location!
