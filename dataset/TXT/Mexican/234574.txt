svdEhLmNmpVaIv1WLtoOvQ What a wonderful find!!! We stumbled in here after looking for nearby food and couldn't resist the name.

They have a wide beer selection from breweries all over on draft with a supplemental bottled list that is sure to hit anyone's tastes or prefences.

They have a full bar so if beer isn't your thing,  no worries. 

That leads us to the tacos, there is such a variety of different amazing tacos that we found ourselves hard pressed not to order way too many. 

Rather then having plates the tacos are are alacart. The al pastor taco was my favorite, but nothing we tried was short of a 4 to 5 star taco.

If you havent tried this place you have to get in here!! The service was amazing, Emily was so sweet and attentive helping us navigate through the many tacos.

Will be bringing our friends here!!
