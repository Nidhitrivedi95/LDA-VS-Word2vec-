Wc9UpJhOcdSj7olZkz7SJA First this is one of my favorite burger joints in all of Arizona. Make sure you add the bacon and onions and grab the pink lemonade on the side. 

If you are in a rush its probably best to skip this place during the lunch rush. This goes double in the summer as the indoor seating is limited and the lines are always long from 11-1PM during the week.

I have also tried the taco's which were OK, if you are coming here its probably for the hamburgers.
