LtO6vTBfYzlgWArn3kRe_A This is one the worst restaurants ever came across. I have to get on separate lines just to order my food it literally took me an 1 1/2 hrs to get my food and then to eat my food with my family they were already done eating and my food was cold . This place needs to get more organized and have better communication. I was just visting ,not coming back again ... Ps I rather not give them no stars but it doesn't let me
