sS__otwzn0INyR_5Dimfdg My favorite Mexican food in Arizona so far. I have been eating here for a long time now, and every time I go I want to try something new but can't seem to stay away from their tacos. I recommend their carne asada, caramello, and jaz tacos. I get them every time and am never disappointed. This is a real Mexican food joint- don't expect to receive excellent customer service, especially if you want to customize your order. The workers are always friendly, but some of them don't speak English fluently and will get confused if a customer gets picky. Also, the tacos don't come with cilantro and onions so you have to ask for it on the side if you want it. No big deal- they will give you a huge plate of both cilantro/onions if you ask! Also, the beans are amazing. They put some kind of spicy sauce in them.

Actually, this might be my favorite place to eat period. This is the place I will be craving and thinking about if I ever leave Arizona. SO GOOD!
