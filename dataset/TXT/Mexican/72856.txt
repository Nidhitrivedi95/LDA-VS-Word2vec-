Cd2ERofxOeCbCi-0yDs0aw We have since moved away but this was my favorite breakfast burrito location since it opened.  You can tell by the other reviews that it is just freaking amazing.  Even their plane chips and retried beans are good.  The owner is awesome ( from what I remember his mom is Maria).  Wish I still lived closer because I crave their red salsa and burritos.
