cCV0q8VV5RZIfcvolWXlBQ I hate that you can't trust Yelp reviews anymore bc of fraud (I was offered good money to write bogus reviews- so I take everything I read here with a grain of salt)  Nevertheless I hope that Taco Bell management reads this occasionally...altho I doubt it.  
So anyway.....
Most people write reviews to complain.  I'm trying to be more conscious about the reviews I write & write good reviews, as well as the inevitable bad ones.
Which brings me to my reason for the 5 Stars.  It's NOT bc of the food.  I'm NOT a fan of fast food, but my husband likes it so I acquiesce... sometimes.   

SUSAN is the reason I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars.  
I'm a big believer that ANY place of business will excel if they treat their employees right.  I wrote another review of this same restaurant bc of another woman who worked there & she quit shortly afterwards.  
My guess is that management & TPTB @ Taco Bell do NOT know how to treat & therefore retain good employees.  We'll see how long Susan continues to work at Taco Bell, I'm guessing if she's gone before too long... then we'll know the reason WHY.  
THIS IS A MULTI BILLION-DOLLAR COMPANY FOR GOD'S SAKE!
Can't someone catch a clue???
