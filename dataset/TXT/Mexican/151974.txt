jWpTckAGWMWEffl2D7NhCA Came here last week to pick up something for my lunch date with my husband at his work.  We normally order out for both of us at an Asian place, or I'll get Subway for myself, but wanted something different.  Had a craving for chili relleno burrito.  Ordered one of these to go and it wasn't too bad.  However, definitely something you can NOT eat while driving.  It was very messy as there was a red sauce that just went everywhere.  Glad I wasn't wearing white.

Maybe less sauce in the burritos.  But it tasted alright.  

It seemed like a place for all types of people.  I was actually surprised there were several other Asian people in there besides me ordering.  

Though there were many orders ahead of me, it really didn't take too long.  The place seemed clean.  Not a big place.  Would I come again?  Possibly, but I'd get something else to see if other things taste alright.
