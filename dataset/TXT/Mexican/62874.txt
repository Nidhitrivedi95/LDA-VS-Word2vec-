aXRrMXXoAN7lawHICgmsxw Great little place to drop in and grab a quick bite and a cocktail. The happy hour is awesome. The staff quite friendly. And the food is delicious. The Dressing Room has a nice little cocktail list with some well made drinks that are a great deal during happy hour. The all day burrito was a very well made combination of flavours that really works well all day.

I look forward to dining there again!
