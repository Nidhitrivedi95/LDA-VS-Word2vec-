RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg Great street tacos and on the strip. I ordered 2 of Asada, 1 of pastor and a mulita of Asada. Tacos are served on freshly made tortillas red salsa, onions and cilantro, and quacamole. The pastor taco came with a green sauce I'm not sure what it was made of but was definitely unique. I found the Asada to be a bit on the salty side but fine once you squeeze a bit of lemon on them. The location seems very busy but clean and easy to get to from the strip. I will be coming back on my next stay in Vegas.
