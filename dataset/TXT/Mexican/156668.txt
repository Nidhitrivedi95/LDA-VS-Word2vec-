KGqvUQQA4c9GJpi5-znsew I have been to this location a handful of times and although the drive thru line is always long, it is all well worth it! They give me a meal deal without a drink and charge me less; I can't say the same for the Federicos on Cave Creek. The also give me tiny sides of rice and beans..again, the other location does not! Score for this location and the awesome customer service and giving the customer what they want!!
