G7LYpILnHveyvbg3sJePPw $4.95 for anything on the menu is the best deal this city has to offer. Period. 

At that price, I wouldn't have even cared if the portions were small and the food were shitty. In fact, I was expecting it. But I can admit when I'm wrong, and boy was I ever! The servings were huge for the price, and the food was super tasty. We biggest mistake was underestimating this spot and ordering five plates of food (nachos, perogies, mac and cheese, pulled pork sandwich, quesadilla - all delicious)... my belly was figuratively bursting by the end of the meal. They also have an incredible selection of drinks, and pints are super cheap. 

My biggest regret of the whole evening is that I'm going to want to eat here now every night.
