U21YaTK4PVlfNHQSyBkJUg This place is great! 4.5 stars...I had a green chile beef and bean burrito smothered in their spicy green sauce, and it was delicious! The green sauce has a great kick to it and awesome flavor. The beans are yummy too! 

I've been away from Phoenix for sometime and don't know how I missed this place when i lived here. Definitely a good lunch spot!!
