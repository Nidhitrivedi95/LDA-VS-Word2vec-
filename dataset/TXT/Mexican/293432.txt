YYE0C8FeDpB6zqB0kSEh7w I am from New Mexico and have been waiting for a restaurant that serves New Mexican cuisine!!!  This is not Mexican food.......it is New Mexican and as such is truly "addictive".  The red and green chile were perfect and if you like it hot, like I do, ask for triple x hot.  We started our meal with chips and the best salsa; they sell the salsa if you have a mind to take some home.  I ordered stacked carne adovada enchiladas with red and green chile (it is called christmas style); it was simply amazing!  The restaurant was beautifully decorated and you can even have a beer or a margarita!!!  The owner is a little lady who runs her butt off making her customers happy!  Be patient, the food is worth the wait.... or better yet come early like we did!!!
