frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A We recently moved to Phoenix and were excited to try all the new culinary wonders around us. Unfortunately we found this place first and were HOOKED! We have been there 3 times in the past week. The mole is delicious as is the Aztec Tinga Burrito. Even the veggie taco is scrumptious and is not missing meat in the least! The horchata is really, really good as well. Keep it up!
