ms7cmWkPiSBDTnz-1sv2kQ Went to Ticoz while in Phoenix for a softball tournament and the weekend of April 9th-10th.  A friend of the team's knew the owner and took us there after the closing ceremonies on Sunday for a late dinner.  We had a party of 12 and they sat us out on the patio. Luckily there were heaters cause it was kinda chilly. Good weather for a cup of pazole to start off with..yummers. For dinner I had pork Chimichanga. So good!  Unfortunately I could not finish cause I had been drinking most of the night and my stomach was filled to the brim.  Everyone was quite happy with their food and most took left over back to the hotel to snack on later.  Service was fast and friendly. Our waiter was a lot of fun.  The owner even came back to the restaurant after he heard our friend was there and stayed to chat with us and even help our waiter deliver all our food.  Fantastic place.
