mqqpu_OBoaQmtA4wFfG-Yg My coworker and I went to lunch yesterday. Service was extremely slow but I was willing to not complain until I saw a ROACH crawling just were we were eating. I told our waitress and asked to speak to the manager. The manager comes over and says "oh I heard you saw a roach, we sprayed in the morning so thats what happens, I am sure it was just one of the little ones" i am sorry, but should the size of the roach matter? He never apologized and acted as if having cockroaches at the restaurant is perfectly ok. Never coming back. Id I could give zero stars I would.
