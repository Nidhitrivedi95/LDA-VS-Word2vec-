Haven't been back to an Arriba's in probably close to four years or so thats how disgusting and horrible i thought the food was everytime i went. Very hesitant on coming here especially on Christmas for dinner, but since it was literally the only place open in the area i decided to go for it. Surprisingly,  our server was awseome and super friendly and my meal was excellent. Couldn't believe it. Not sure if it was just this location or what the deal was but i will probably only eat at this location if i eat at Arribas again.
