P8TQOkplgiQDdHRUj-IZRA very warm and friendly service 

the restaurant / bakery offers a selection of dishes from 3 countries!: columbia, peru and mexico. 

that day we tried a couple of popular peruvian dishes they were different but nothing i'd order again.  

the highlight though was the warm to the touch golden globes of almojabanas - a columbian cheese filled bread (see pic) i'd stop in for this anytime :)
