lrAUseySfmFeZkWOGfsKnQ WORST TACOS and misleading advertising. Let's start with the fact that just because you have a open window store front on a street doesn't give you the right to label you're tacos "street tacos." Let's leave that honor to the proper establishments like King Taco in Los Angeles. 

Moreover, a traditional "street taco" has the basics starting with and most importantly...A CORN TORTILLA, NOT FLOWER! Now if you're trying to have the basic "street taco" then you missed the point by just offering asada y polo. Maybe substitute your chopped cabbage, with some cilantro. Try substituting your liquid green paste with real avocado guacamole. Instead of generic store bought pico de gallo, maybe serve diced white onions. And last but not least, maybe substitute your ground red chile with water for some actual flavorful salsa.

I would like to note that I have never given a bad review in Yelp, but these tacos reminded me of eating a Taco Bell taco...only worse.

Oh, and I believe it is state law to offer your customers a receipt and not tell them that you can't or to come back in an hour, just saying.
