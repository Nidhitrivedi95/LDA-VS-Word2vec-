They used to make a great old fashion with a huge round block of ice; this time it was crushed ice. My wife ordered a drink and it was half filled. The rest of the order was bland and mediocre. It seems like they skimped on whatever they could. The street corn had a drizzle of topping. We ordered chips and guacamole and received enough chips for one and when asked for a refill they charged us for it! Also I swear our server was high; he forgot our order, he asked us if we needed to order after we had just placed an order with him, etc. It is sad when a place that was once one of our favorites decided money is more important than the passion of having great food and service. On the bright side one of the servers remembered us too bad we won't be coming back here.
