qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A It was my first time visiting this restaurant. The food was fantastic! The signature salad was delicious. The Pesto torte appetizer is a must have.
The waitress was friendly and helpful. The atmosphere was great. 

The only reason that this rating is not higher is because the bartender left his shift with no one to take over. I was looking forward to trying a signature cocktail.
Hopefully, I when I return to Vegas the bartender will be there.
