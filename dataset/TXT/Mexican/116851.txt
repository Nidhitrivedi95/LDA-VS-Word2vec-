gldPX9ANF5Nic0N7igu2og I. Love. Tacos. So believe me when I say, I've had my share of them.  I didn't even realize Condado existed until one of my friends randomly stumbled upon this treasure.

For starters, the staff is always super attentive and friendly even when it is super busy (which it usually is).  Each time I go I usually get a margarita. I do have to say they don't have the best margaritas, but their chips and queso make up for it.  I usually do a chip and dip trio which I get the spicy queso, salsa, and guac (per request of the group, I'm not really a guac fan).  The chips and queso are to die for.  I also get El Santo, one of their speciality tacos.  The menu has tacos already made up, or you can make your own.  I can't lie, I love El Santo so much that it's what I normally order, so I can't speak to the other items.  BUT, anything the rest of my group orders they absolutely love.  

The prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere is very fun ! I will keep coming back for more, for sure !
