XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Yum yum yummy in your tummy! I positively adore Mesa Grill and have been here at least 10 times. Everytime I go to our tradeshow at Caesar's, I make sure to eat at Mesa a minimum of 2-3 times. Lunch or dinner, you won't be dissapointed. 

Here are my favorite dishes:
-apple salad: an awesome salad as far as salads go
-lobster tacos: TO DIE FOR, I could eat 10 of these in 5 minutes
- Blue corn pancake with duck: a must try! 
-coffee rub filet mignon: can't go wrong with a filet, always done to perfection
-new york strip: my personal favorite of the steaks, delicious and a huge portion
-rib-eye: flavorful and very filling, big enough to share at lunch 
-pork tenderloin: well done and great if you don't want steak

We usually share the mashed potatoes and spinach sides which are also good. The service is always excellent and the jalapeno corn bread they give you is awesome. I would give Mesa 5 stars, but the price (naturally) knocks it down a peg for me. The cocktails are good enough, while not being as great as the price is high. 

My best friend loves Mesa so much that even when staying at the Mirage, he pulls himself away from the poker table long enough to trek over just to dine here multiple times a day. Now that's commitment. Give Mesa a try for sure!
