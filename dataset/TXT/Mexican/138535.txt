Iz_SYYhg-fQDQcVgkX9Zxg Great service! Delicious food! Came here after a horrible experience at Las Pupusas (same shopping center), Zusanna from El Nopal made sure we had excellent service she was upbeat, courteous and very attentive! We got tostadas de camaron and fish, kids got breakfast burritos and carne asada fries everything was really delicious and tasty thank you El Nopal for turning a bad experience that you didn't own into your hands to ensure we had a pleasant family brunch. Will definitely come back :)
