Yevhl8bTwdJuu_LWKv-4Fw I'm not entirely certain how to classify this place; it's really somewhere between a gastro-pub and a restaurant.  There's quite a mingling scene, and rather pretty decor, but perhaps my experience is coloured by seat vultures.  

There has definitely been a decline in courtesy in the US, and this night really highlighted it, when the server directed my brother and I to seats that were immediately snatched by an older couple that had been there far later than we.  Now, had they made eye contact, I would have been happy to cede the seat to them.  I mean, they are older, and hopefully having a good date together...  My brother and I could easily stand.  

However, when the server apologized loudly for the seat snatching, these two blithely continued to enjoy their "good find" without acknowledging their breach of etiquette.

Most distasteful.

That said, they have an extensive rum list, and rather decent fare.  I can't vouch for authenticity, in that I haven't eaten enough Mexicana cuisine to have a strong idea as to what they should taste like.  That said, I've been to a lot of Tapas places around the nation, and mexican food in completely latin run and patronized restaurants... My sense is that the flavours are good, but off the mark.

Still, I enjoyed my short rib taquitos and carnitas tacos.  My brother seemed to like his meal.

I'd go back, but not aggressively.
