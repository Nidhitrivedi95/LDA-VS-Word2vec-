CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q You wanna know where all of the Latinos eat at 3AM? This place is legit eating and not a tourist trap. In fact, this one is so legit that I was one of the only non-Latino people here in twilight hours, and it was packed. This location is way better than the one on the strip because THERE IS TONS OF PARKING. Also, the line is SO much shorter! 

Carne asada fries... even a half order is monstrously large. But you should get them anyway. Either share with a friend or if you need to eat your feelings.

Those mulas. Who doesn't love fresh tortilla with griddled cheese?

Adobada is what they are famous for. Get a mula with adobada. Double win.

Maybe it's just me, but horchata on a fountain just doesn't taste good. I found it terrible, but I've only had fresh horchata at little mom and pop shops.

Super awesome dude chopping up all of the meat for orders. I was a lost puppy not really knowing what i was doing, but he was so super patient with me anyway and just super nice. Often people get annoyed when in a customer service-based industry, but everyone working here was really nice.

See ya again next time at 3AM, Tacos El Gordo!
