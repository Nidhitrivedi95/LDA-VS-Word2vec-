plHKBwA18aWeP-TG8DC96Q I have been here three times and every time the food has been superb. The rib, chicken, and fried chicken (On special) tacos were all amazing. Although a single taco is expensive, it is filling and delightful. However my two favorite things are not the tacos themselves. First favorite is the queso. It is quite delicious by itself but the chips that come with it are hands down my favorite chips at any restaurant. They seem to be some sort of flour based chip instead of corn and boy o boy are they delightful. Beware, this serving is very large so I would recommend sharing with at least two people if you want to have any hope of finishing your tacos. Also the corn/broccoli side dish us AMAZING. whatever crumbly goodness they put on top should be illegal but I'm glad that it isn't. One star off because we've had bad service here and I liked it better as Byob (especially when atlas bottle works is right next door). Overall definitely a place to check out if you haven't yet.
