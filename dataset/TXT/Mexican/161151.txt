kz4razShIa8Z09qRKjJZaw My love for Gecko Grill can be summed up in three words: Shrimp. Mango. Quesadilla. It's a huge folded flour tortilla stuffed with shrimp, fresh mango, cheese and seafood sauce, and grilled to perfection. I've been ordering this dish off and on for seven years and it has never let me down - testament to the consistently great quality at this unassuming Mexican joint located in a strip mall.  

The salmon tacos (grilled salmon topped with fresh mango salsa and cheese) are also divine. But since seafood can be polarizing, some other faves include the new-ish fiesta chicken taco salad (grilled chicken breast, fresh mango salsa, avocado, lettuce and cheese), the beef, chicken or pork burro grande (with beans, cheese, guacamole, sour cream and salsa fresca) and the chicken fajita burro (grilled chicken breast, fajita vegetables and beans served with guacamole and sour cream on the side).

Chips are homemade, light and crispy, and both the red and the green salsas are superb. The creamy bean dip is a nice bonus.

And oddly enough, the barbecue's really good, too. (Before my son discovered he liked Mexican food, the BBQ pork sandwich is all he would eat.)

As for atmosphere...well, if you like pink -- and plastic flowers -- you're in luck. For the rest of us, the food is SO good, who cares about the décor? Dining area and restrooms are always clean and the staff is excellent. (We had the same server every time we went for nearly four years until he graduated from college.)

Of note - only Pepsi products are on tap, so if you're a Coke fan, be prepared to pay by the bottle. The mango water is excellent; my mom gets it every time she's in town. If you still have room (which we rarely do), both the flan and the dessert chimis are delicious.
