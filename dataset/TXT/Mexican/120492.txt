GzBIAjAMHD9iVZK8BT6XMw Tacos huevos just recently opened but I recommend you stop in! We tried it for lunch and had a rotisserie chicken bowl with over easy egg on top and 2 street tacos and both were great. Service was friendly. Tacos are handmade! Fresh ingredients. Good price point. It is in a building connected to the Urban Lounge bar which looks like it has a cool ambience as well as an art gallery in the back. We will certainly be back.
