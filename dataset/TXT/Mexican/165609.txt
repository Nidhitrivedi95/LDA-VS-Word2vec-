LnsAgGlvIPmc9eV_cMdU5w Great food and vibe. The staff and owners are really friendly and were great with my 4 year old and 1 year old. I've had the fish tacos twice and they're awesome. My wife had the special taco... Think it was shrimp. Overall a great restaurant. So happy to have a great spot in the neighbourhood.
