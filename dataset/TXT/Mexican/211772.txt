qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A I went here on a date and I got the Jamaican Jerk Salad which was amazing! I'm not a huge fan of spicy food, but the muted flavor of the goat cheese and dressing and the sweetness of the mandarin oranges on the salad balanced with the spices on the chicken seamlessly.  My date got the Mexican Style Slow-Cooked Pork (pictured) loved it.. The portion sizes were bigger than I expected (which is awesome) 
Our server Louis was the man and he explained the menu and specials perfectly and gave us a brief history on the restaurant which was really cool to hear! Great table service, never an empty water glass. My date wanted Sierra Nevada which they didn't have, but Louis suggested a different beer they had which he really enjoyed! Yay Louis! We also ordered the carrot cake which was to die for! Louis told us they have an in-house pastry chef! We will definitely be back! Seriously a great time, perfect date night! We'll be back for bottomless memosas!
