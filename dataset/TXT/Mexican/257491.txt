VIJ2KiDKhUVhhpNylEIfog Stringy chicken that's apparently been sitting in a pot somewhere for hours, no caramelized onions or cheese even though I asked for a taco Mexican style. Maybe it's because the students aren't back from break, but there were three girls behind the counter. And on top of all that, no chips with a one taco order. If I wanted a half-assed snack I would have made it myself. This is a vastly over-rated restaurant only suitable for half-drunk, hungry students.
