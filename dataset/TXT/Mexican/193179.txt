OOHlm2lbVgPHhSe98YW3yA Great location with minimalistic, hipster vibes. They offer samples of the different agua fresca flavor which are delicious. I got three tacos and was delighted when the cashier told me I could mix and match from the taco selections. I got two shredded pollo and one korean taco. It said the pollo was a best seller but in my opinion the Korean beef was the best. I can't wait to come back here!
