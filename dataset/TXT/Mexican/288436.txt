yG9SpxEQVIhk6e1o3jbSKg Agave is what you would expect a Mexican restaurant in Crocker Park to be.  Decent quality food, if bland and uninspiring, and an ultra trendy atmosphere.

THE ATMOSPHERE:  I usually review the food first, but as food is not the focal point, I'll concentrate on what is obviously the most important thing. The space is really cool.  The front of the restaurant is a giant window, perfect for people watching.  The place is decorated in deep reds and polished wood with cool modern-ish art on the walls.  The effect is more undifferentiated, sexy Latin than Mexican.

THE SERVICE:  Very friendly and responsive.  Our waitress was very pleasant.

THE FOOD:  The quality of the ingredients is very good.  However, this is ultra Americanized Mexican.  Mon cher chou had a burrito, served loosely wrapped, meant to be eaten with a fork and knife.  He said that all the ingredients were very good-- it wasn't as if they used the melange to cover up sloppy preparation.  I had the shrimp fajitas.  There were 8 shrimp on a giant bed of grilled onions and peppers.  The Mexican rice was well made and flavorful.  The guac was serviceable and smooth.  Margueritas were standard.

It blows my mind that more restaurants in Crocker Park don't have kids menus.  Crocker Park!  That paeon to suburbia!  Agave's owners were wise enought to develop a really nice kids menu-- 8 selections, each for $6.  It includes some American food and kids' versions of quesadillas and burittos.  You can choose from one of several sides-- rice, Mexican rice, etc. and FRUIT!!!  How nice not to have to feed your child fries!  The fruit cup was great--albeit miniscule.  There were fresh berries, apples and pineapple.

All in all a decent place to grab a bite if you are not expecting authentic Mexican food, but just want something tasty.
