Sat in a booth and had to wait for a server for about 30 minutes because of the band that needed to play with their rear ends in our face. At least it was authentic, I think.

The margaritas that everyone has raved about on Yelp are sub par. 


The guacamole was actually very good. The nachos were pretty good as well. The soup they give you is awesome. So how did it get a D+? The dinners were terrible.
As for the food, the "gulf" shrimp are salad shrimp that ruin what was a flavorful dish. The chicken salad was over cooked chicken on some leaves of lettuce. The mole poblano had the same terrible chicken as the salad that ruined the dish. 

Bottom line: Stick to Taco Bell.
