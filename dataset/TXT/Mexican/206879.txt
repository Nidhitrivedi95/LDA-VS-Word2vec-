Q4AWWdBWe_ojYX1a4ffXFQ I hardly give five stars. Actually hardly give any good reviews unless everything is perfect. I have worked in restaurant industry, my girlfriend is manager for several restaurants. By far this is the most perfect casual dining restaurant we have seen. Super clean, simple decor, good uniforms, friendly cashier, fast kitchen. Perfect tasting food. I live in Chicago where there is a Taco place in every corner. However, this is probably the best Mexican food i have ever had. 

Plus when it got busy the manager stopped working on his lap-top jumped in the kitchen helping. He was very supportive and friendly to his employees. That is what makes the difference between a boss and a leader.

Whenever i go to Vegas, I will include El Dorado Express in my to visit places.
