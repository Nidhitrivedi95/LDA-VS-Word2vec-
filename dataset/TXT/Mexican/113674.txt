gdtZA3sVQ5Hk-3oPBArdLA Very impressed with the food, tried a few different things, tacos, taquitos and the corn. Everything was fresh and excellently seasoned. Missed out on the ceviche so I will be heading back soon and often. Super friendly staff made it a great experience since I took forever trying to decide what I wanted.
Worth the trip.
