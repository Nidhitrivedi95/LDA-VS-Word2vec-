7-Ba9uSmYYpXgnQRoIPxMQ We stopped in here after going to the movies one evening and got a Cuban Sandwich.  It was pretty tasty, so we came back a week or so later.

When you first get it, it seems like a great place.  Nice atmosphere, lively, etc...

It was a Friday night around 7:30-8pm.  It was busy, but definitely not packed.  The whole other side of the restaurant was empty.  Needless to say, our waitress was slow. Not really around very much.  We ordered two mojitos and it took 10 minutes to get them.  Meanwhile there were 3 bartenders who were not that busy.  Finally got the drinks and ordered.

The Tostones Camerones were pretty good considering they were smothered in cheese.  Anything is good smothered in cheese.

I ordered the Vaca Frita.  The description was a flank steak marinated in their mojo sauce with rice and beans.  I was thinking the steak would be tender.  Not so.  It was a plate of dried out, burned shredded up steak.  Had absolutely no flavor.  The rice was fine, but its rice.  Hard to mess up.

My husband got a chicken breast that was covered in onions and a side of white rice and beans.  It was good, but NOTHING SPECIAL.

I guess what Im trying to say is that this place is nothing special, although you might think so when you first walk in.  It's super overpriced for what you get.  I will probably never go there again.  

If you go, just get an appetizer and the cuban.
