TEaBolNAkOdRm2gvIYz4OQ Quick getting seated. Friendly staff. The food came out so fast and it was delicious. I got the pollo fondito, which is supposedly "everyone's favorite" but I have to be honest, it was good but not the best. My fiancé got the el crudo and it was great! I'll definitely be coming back to try other dishes, though!
