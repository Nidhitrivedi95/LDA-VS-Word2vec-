-qb_3LLSnBcHA6zc8NRSxQ Great service! They had a musician walking around to each table singing music while he played his guitar. He was friendly, too. The complimentary chips and salsa were tasty. I ordered the green chile chimichanga enchilada style (red or green sauce options), and I enjoyed it very much. The rice and beans are also very good. My girl ordered the fried fish tacos and liked them, only downfall was that the homemade corn tortillas were not warm enough.
