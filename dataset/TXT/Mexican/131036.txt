iBlQvqiy5Rg2h-y9TS1yOA Man, I REALLY want to love this place. It's the closest place to my house that serves margaritas, so by default they get at LEAST two stars...and unfortunately, that's about it.

I've been here several times (I keep trying to love it) but it always disappoints. Each time I've been here, the service has been sub-par (both at the bar and also at a table). But look - I'm willing to look past bad service for great margaritas, but that's not the case either.  The drinks have NOT been delicious, but they certainly were pricey. 

Ugh - and the FOOD...I've tried a couple different entrees and appetizers and it's just not that good. From the bacon wrapped jalapeño to the taco salad, the execution just isn't there. Everything on the menu sounds great...but it just doesn't hit the spot. 

I'll give it another 6 months and try again...like I said, I REALLY want to like it.
