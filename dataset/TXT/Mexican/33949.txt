4tmDq6jkFMQ3eac-BkF1jw So sad cause I so wanted to have fun Saturday. We all decided to try the new spot in Old Town before meeting our friends for dinner at Eddie's House. Well NOT a good idea. Sad but we will not be back EVER. Too many great spots in Scottsdale and terrible terrible terrible service
