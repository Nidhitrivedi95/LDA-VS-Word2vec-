mES9E5K4HbYoPFXGv0pUuw Time to upgrade my rating on this place.

This actually became the Mexican restaurant I frequented the most recently because it was a favourite among coworkers at my last place of employment.

I do actually like the grilling of the tortilla she'll. I've never been to Mexico so maybe it is a style in a particular region there?

Anyways, I'm upgrading by a star because they have a great weekday lunch special, the food is consistent and the service is pretty friendly. I recommend that you give it a try if you're in the area.
