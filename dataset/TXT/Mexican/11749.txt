Go upstairs, park yourself at the bar and make sure Tony is your bartender. 

Went here with a colleague yesterday and we had a blast. It's always fun talking to other tourists. After much contemplation we went the chicken nachos. Mighty tasty. She had a couple of beers and I had my signature Grey Goose on the rocks with a lime. Believe it or not, we did not spend an arm and a leg!

Fun atmosphere, the music was awesome and it was just chill. Service with lots of smiles and nothing to be had but a good time.

BIG THUMBS UP in my book.
