Yewxcf5-kbESoS5r1l-1AQ 1st round: 

"Donald Trump Taco" lots of tongue with no brain... (see round 3)

"Bavette" (Arrachera)= 90% a touch on the dry side, but regardless, full of flavor;

"Contre-Filet" (Bistec)= 95% really 
C really good.

Round 2: 

"Longaniza" (agárrame confianza!) solid 95%, specially with the fries wall centred with coriander, onion and double tortilla!

Round 3:

The infamous "DT (tongue) Taco"= 100%. Truly amazing prep, just for  connoseurs!

Friendly staff, nice urban deco, stand up concept, just like in Mexico!

All in all, an dream addition to the taco offering on the island. Made rememberu the "Chupacabras Taco Stand", that good! ;o)
