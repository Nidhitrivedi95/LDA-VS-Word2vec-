S_bG5WWbtNXhhY9Y0GTcSg I was back in Phoenix on vacation and decided to stop in. It's right off the light rail which is a plus. I sat at the bar but you order first then grab a seat inside or outside. I opted for a Mimosa and the French toast and sausage. Definitely farm to table is correct. A generous portion of French toast, with fresh berries and delicious syrup. The sausage was in a nice casing that popped when you cut into it. 
The Mimosa was great accompaniment to the meal. 
Great customer service and prices that can't beat.
