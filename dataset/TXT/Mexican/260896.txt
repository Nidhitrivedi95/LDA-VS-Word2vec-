VRwT0pscR5vESCrAnUpNwQ Upon eating here, it is quite obvious that the people behind this restaurant have focused more on the design and appearance of the restaurant rather than the actual food.

The queso was not very good. Tasted like easy cheese. Also, it was not even warm.

The taquitos were alright. Good flavor.

Finally, the tacos were decent - but again, they were room temperature.

All in all, I won't be back. I don't go to Mexican restaurants for fancy design - I go for the food, and Wilbur did not deliver on that.
