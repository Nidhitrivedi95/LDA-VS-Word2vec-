MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA This place was good and draws a vey mixed crowd of people. Definitely got character. Went on a Saturday right when it opened (they do not take reservations). 

The food was very prettily presented and it is more of a tapas style restaurant than actual meal style. 

Ordered: 

-fish and cauliflower tacos which were good, but not life changing 

-the tortilla soup was very good and had a very diverse and rich flavour profile

-chicken wings were good and meaty 

- ceviche was disappointing, repeated properly, but not the right proportions for all the ingredients in it

- the spicy squid was good and the fresh guac added a nice balancing note to the food 

- the kale salad is GREAT! It is not overdressed and comes with twisted spiced nuts of sorts on top. Delicious! 

-mojito was very sweet, but still yummy and had a great ginger presence

-the lemon/lime? Dessert was good but nothing out of this world and very small portion (a two bite dessert kind of feel)
