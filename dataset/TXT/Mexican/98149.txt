ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA I came to this place a couple of weeks ago and all was pretty good... Came back today and it was a disaster, service wasn't very good this time. In addition, my husband ordered scrambled eggs and they were almost raw to the point that he could barely eat any of it (only the edge got cooked). When we mentioned this to our waiter "hey, just wanted to share feedback that the eggs were not cooked" all she said was "ok"... then she came with our check and apologized and said she "took care of the issue", we noticed she took $2 off of our $30 check... regardless of the amount and not even expecting a discount at all, based on principle, this experience today sucked... doubt we'll be back...
