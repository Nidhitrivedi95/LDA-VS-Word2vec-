WpI5MZC3XzlTpcUOKXzCbA Let me just say WOW. This place was recommended to me be a local family member and it by far exceeded my expectectations. I went with my brother and my one year old niece, and the staff was incredibly attentive and made sure we were taken care of. We sat by the windows and had a beautiful view of the city, including the strip. I tend to make assumptions about how the food will be based on the salsa they start you off with and the salsa here was really good. The mango margarita was so close to heaven. I was happy with the variety of dishes they offered and ended up ordering the shrimp stuffed chiles rellenos. I really want to highlight how amazing the staff was though. They all worked as a team and made our visit very pleasant.
