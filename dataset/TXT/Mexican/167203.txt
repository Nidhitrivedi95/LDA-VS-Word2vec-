LrBDBaGfONR7Kmg8sG38dA Just tried to eat here for the first time (it's one of those places we keep driving past and say "hey we should go there sometime, it looks cool" but never actually go). Waited a couple minutes for a hostess, ok cool maybe she's busy nbd. A man greets us says it'll be about 15-20 minutes for a table, I ask if we can just sit at the bar which is completely empty. He responds "no there's a wait for the bar too" we say ok no worries and give our name. About 10-15 minutes pass and we peer around, the restaurant appears to be at least half empty but there are several people waiting for a table. Now a new girl is at the hostess stand so I go up and ask again "excuse me can we just sit at the bar" and she says "sure, you can sit at the bar top" "ok great thank you!" We proceed to sit at the bar top. I look down and the bar really looks like it hasn't been wiped down all day. The same gentleman who told us we couldn't sit at the bar is making margaritas in the corner. He looks directly at us and then immediately away without acknowledging us and then walks away. We sit at the dirty bar another 5 minutes, no one appears to work the bar and we gave up and left. SUPER disappointed. It looked so cool.
