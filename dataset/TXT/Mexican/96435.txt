eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw The service was slow, our food took forever to come out and when it did it was cold and the the cheese on our nachos were hard and gross. It took forever for them to refill our drinks and it was not even busy, we were like the third table out of four eating.. I have hard such great things about this place but I didn't experience any of that today. I don't think we will ever be going back to this place again..
