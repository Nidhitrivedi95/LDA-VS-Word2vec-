GETVAz5SCk8rFziexV54Aw Return for lunch and we were a little disappointed. The chicken mole was okay but it is much better at Los Sombrero's. My mother ordered a beef burrito, which isn't on the menu, but what she got was mostly a rice burrito with a tiny amount of beef. The service is still very good as are the Margaritas. Don't think we'll be back.
