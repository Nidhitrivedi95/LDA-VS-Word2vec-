O_UC_izJXcAmkm6HlEyGSA Excellent Mexican, and probably very authentic (but what do I know?).

This place was surprisingly busy on a Monday night, but we managed to snag a table for four without issue. The seating is TIGHT though; expect to be rammed against the seat behind you.

Chips and guac are excellent, though I didn't care for the wings.

While the tacos al pastor were good, I think they were trumped by my partner's tacos de chori-queso. I mean, sausage and cheese? Yes please.

That said, the burritos knock the tacos out of the park. In terms of value there's no comparison (burrito the size of my fat head), but the sauces they layer on top are phenomenal. I started diverting chips meant for the guacamole into the remnants of my dish.

Ordering to go is a hassle-free process, and they were prompt and punctual with the food. Given how tight the resto is take-out will be a viable option for us, despite the warm vibe of the place.
