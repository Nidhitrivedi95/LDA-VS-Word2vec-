On a not too late Saturday night, we wanted Mexican food along Old Town Scottsdale.   Decided to try Salty's.  Wait was not long at all.  We waited 10 minutes before the hostess came and asked if we had been attended to yet.  Of course not so she brought us water and said she would return with chips.  Another 10 minutes later she brought those.  Close to 10 minutes more and the "replacement " waitress takes our order.  And how long before drinks arrive?  Yes, 10 minutes but only the alcoholic drinks.  My sprite took another 10 minutes even though we were next to the bar.

Finally the food comes and it is good.  I ordered the grilled shrimp bowl and hubby got the steak salad.  Shrimp could have been bigger.  Rice was cooked perfectly and the combination with the black beans was good.

If you have lots of time to kill, check this place out.  No free wifi.  We sat outside so we picked it up from RnR across the street.
