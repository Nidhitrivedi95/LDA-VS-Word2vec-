IhbvQcaLJh80JhJA-OPv1w I really love qdoba. I don't get to eat here as often as I'd like bc I don't live right by one, but when I get there I am reminded how sad that makes me!
To me, this is one of many places where you need to know the best items to order, in terms of value, what to put on the items, etc. as an example:  On a recent trip, I got the Pick 2, with the gumbo and the nachos. They were both stacked so high they were hard to carry steadily to the table, and my dining companion and I SHARED this for $7.50 and were both full! However, I saw another diner who ordered the Pick 2 with soup, and had maybe a 1/2 cup serving of soup. 
Anyway, the main thing I need to say here is TRY THE GUMBO. It is so amazing, and is mainly what keeps me craving qdoba. The pork and the shredded beef are both fantastic options. I love corn salsa, so I'm always happy to see that. Their guacamole is very good quality too.
