4K5NUsinIgtq-yuxdp2HdA Stopped back in here the other evening around 8:30 or so. I was pretty hungry and it was Tuesday so I got 3 tacos and an order of latin potatoes. I got a grilled fish, a tempura fish, and a shredded beef taco and all were fantastic. Once again they were very large tacos and the longest part of the wait was the huge line to get to order because it was taco Tuesday on ASU campus. The potatoes were pretty good too will likely order them all again. Would recommend to anyone trying to get their taco fix.
