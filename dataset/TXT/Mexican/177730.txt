mUAEn4Ud0PN-Dv446vhfSg Read a lot of reviews for this place saying that it is good and it is my husband had the carne asada nachos I had a chicken chimichanga out of guacamole today a little bit disappointing but the front counter girl apologize for this she gave me lots of sour cream on my chimichanga which made me happy husband stated the steak was a little overcooked and chewy portions are huge plan on taking some of it home for another meal we will be back
