UJewG9UgVXQ7fyP4UHwnxw No, just no. Don't do it, you'll regret it!!   Came in for a quick lunch and got the three taco plate to go. I'm not a big eater but when I pulled it out of the bag it was literally the size of one Rubio's Fish taco - which I DO recommend you get. I opened them right away and proceeded to eat them but they were still cold and clammy. They all had different delicious descriptions (Carne Asada, Al Pastor and Chicken) but they all tasted the same - bland bland bland!!  I actually rummaged through my glove box to find a salt packet which I did thankfully find, better but not by much. The only thing that would've made this meal good, it's to have gone to Rubio's!!
