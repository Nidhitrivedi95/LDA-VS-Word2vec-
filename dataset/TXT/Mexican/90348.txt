dusNIzdCaH6EoLl2hRy6cQ I'm tempted to rate a 5 star, but minus a star for the lack of eating space (well moreover comfortable eating space).

Great place if you want something quick, yummy, and CHEAP. How many places can you eat on the strip for a $10 or less dinner. I grabbed a chicken salad w/guacamole and it was excellent. Fresh food and efficient service. It was $8.11 including guacamole with my chicken salad. Well worth it!
