1ZJz840L496LAmQdeDv0WA Came here on Halloween night, it was pretty busy! But the staff was friendly and fast paced so it wasn't much of a wait for our food. I think their menu could use a little touch up because it's kind of faded, but it's still legible! My boyfriend and I got an order of Carne Asada Fries, corn on the cob and two margaritas.
The fries were sooo good. The portion size was very generous. For me the fries were a little too crispy but I didn't care too much because everything else on the plate with it was too good! 
The corn on the cob was yummy. I've never tried corn with all those toppings but the flavors worked perfectly. I'll be getting it again the next time I come in! 
The margaritas were really strong. But I liked it. So no complaints there :). They were fairly filling despite the fact that the cup looks like it isn't holding much! 
If you're in downtown container park, I would recommend this place if you're in the mood for some good mexican food!
