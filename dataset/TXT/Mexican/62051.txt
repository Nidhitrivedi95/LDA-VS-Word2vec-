aVKOO7rBVo2lCj-KElxp5Q Had the lunch special of 2 tacos (ground beef), chips & salsa, and a soda for $6.  I ordered the hard taco shells, and though they were soggy and broke apart, I still ate it up with a fork.  I liked the taste and enjoyed them.  The chips were good, though the salsa was nothing special.  The owner/employee was very friendly.  I was satisfied with my visit and will return.
