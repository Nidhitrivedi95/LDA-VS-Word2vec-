J5ebC7fKqrSF8KuS8d6hgw Had lunch here on a Friday with an old boss and boy am I glad we decided on Sierra Bonita! We both had the 5 spice chicken sandwich and fries. While I am not a huge chicken sandwich eater this was perfect! I even went home and talked about this sandwich! It was very juicy (which sometimes can be tricky and can be VERY dry)...the flavor was great. The fries were cooked to a perfect crisp too. It was a great lunch to wrap up a busy work week!
