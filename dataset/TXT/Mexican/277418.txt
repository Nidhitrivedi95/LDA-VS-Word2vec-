Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ I eat here pretty much every time I am in Vegas. The mariscos de camarones and the prickly pear margarita are delicious and unique. 

The last time I was here I met the owner of a food tour company that takes corporate groups on eating trips around the city. He had very complimentary things to say about Javier's. 

The other thing I like is that Javier's opens early. If you are arriving from the east coast and your room at the Cosmo or the Aria isn't ready then come have Mexican lunch.
