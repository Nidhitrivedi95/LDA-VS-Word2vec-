But it is currently 9 pm on a Sunday and the lobby is locked and the we knocked and the employee looked right at us and gestured with her hand under her neck like "no go" or something. Then she walked immediately to the back. Well still kind of wanting the food, we go through the drive thru and she immediately answers. We ask for one sec to think and then after a short time say we're ready and there is no answer or voice for the next 3 minutes, we actually backed out and drove back up to see and then finally she asked what we wanted and we ordered and paid. She was overall rude and it makes no sense that the lobby should be locked WITH PEOPLE INSIDE EATING and yet she looked right at us and chose not to let us in.
