XMrLwzmEAsfNpbKRC7vUzQ Well, I'm vegetarian so my reviews of the food are lacking. I usually just get a grilled cheese or cheese dip. They are both delicious but I don't think any meat-loving adults would care much about either. They do, however, have an incredible number of TVs. I think I counted between 75 and 150 last time I went. There's always something to watch. The service is great. And they have a pretty decent beer selection for a chain restaurant. I go to the Flying Saucer for beer a lot and they have about 1/2 - 2/3 the selection of the Saucer, which is still quite impressive. I'm not big on the food there but the Brewniversity club does have its perks (free stuff, mainly). The food is pretty decent bar food, there's plenty of beer and there are plenty of TVs. Definitely my kind of place if it werent for the food prices.
