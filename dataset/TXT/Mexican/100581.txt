eSENXDnnNSo-MLLkWJQ8Vg I was very enthusiastic to finally eat at this place because of all the good reviews, but was disappointed.
First of all the place was filthy, tables were dirty, food on the floor, I felt bad because there was only one server but based on appearances i would not recommend this place. 
The food was ok nothing special I was expecting better. I ordered a quesadilla, it looked delicious don't get me wrong but it had no flavor. Mom ordered chicken tacos and was quiet upset that they served her food on a broken plate. If your looking for authentic Mexican food then this place is not for you.
