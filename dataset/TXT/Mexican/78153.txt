cL38u23Ez492pToB4xZZXQ Just awful! By now, enough of us out there have had Chipotle. It's loved by many because of their fresh ingredients and lack of greasy deep fried objects. Pedro's attempts to be a Chipotle-like business but completely misses the mark. If you're going to mirror your business with an existing/successful one, you'd better make sure your food looks and tastes good! It should, at the very least, taste close to the original. 

The cilantro-lime rice was wet and mushy, the steak didn't even look (or taste) like steak and the remaining toppings were bland and uneventful. On top of that, the staff seemed very inexperienced and borderline rude. It's hard to find REALLY good food inside Tower City. Pedro's now gets added to the list of places I'll never eat at again.
