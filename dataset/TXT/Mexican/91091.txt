DyOzNIeXUksPNLXYHnB-oQ Love this place!! Went for taco Tuesday, and I got tacos, queso, guac, and margartias with our group. The food was very good and authentic and a great price! It gets very crowded and was hard for our group to find a seat all together, but the place was great and I would definitely go back
