eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg I was looking forward to trying this place because I constantly see people here and the reviews are really good. 
It's definitely not your normal Mexican spot...they don't have rice or beans and they don't serve chips and salads. Instead they serve bread and some other stuff with it...it was okay....the waiter was okay....he was kinda rude when we asked if the had rice and beans he said "no we don't serve that, whatever you see on the menu is what you get". It was obviously our first time here and he didn't care to explain how this place isn't the typical Mexican restaurant. I ordered GREEN enchiladas and when I got my food they were RED. The chicken isn't even shredded in the Tortilla it's literally like a whole chicken breasts. I tried to eat it, but it just wasn't good. So I told the waiter this isn't what I ordered and he looked at his paper and said "oh yeah you're right". Umm okay I know I'm right. So I asked him to take it off. My bf ordered chorizo with eggs and potatoes....the meal looked like a joke. First off the server forgot to add the chorizo and it only came out with 2 eggs and a very small side of potatoes for $15?!! He then brought the chorizo on the side in a small little cup that they serve ketchup in. 

I don't recommend this place. Our service sucked and the food is mediocre.
