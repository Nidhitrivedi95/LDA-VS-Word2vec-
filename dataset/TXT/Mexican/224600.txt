RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg Visited Tacos El Gordo last Saturday at 11 AM. The place was already packed and the security guard lady was already giving people directions on how to order their tacos (unheard of if you go to the Tijuana location). The lines were not very clear and the menu was hard to see because of the décor hanging from the ceiling.

I had my usual, tacos de carne asada. They looked and tasted legit! So the wait was worth it. Corn tortillas were handmade, salsa and guacamole on point and asada cooking over fire. I truly enjoyed my tacos and wished I had order 6 instead of just 4. I was very disappointed that they didn't have Mexican Coca-Cola or Fanta. They only have canned sodas and a fountain drink machine. Tacos were $2.25 each and the fountain drink was $2.00 (cheapest meal on the strip I tell you).

Decided to come back on Sunday before heading back home. Well, they say they open at 9 AM, but in reality they didn't start serving people until 9:30 Am ( I waited about 45 minutes outside...the smell of the asada I tell you). When we finally got to order I ordered 5 asada tacos, well I noticed that the guacamole was missing, so I asked where is the guac? The taco man replied "we don't have any until the evening." I was VERY DISAPPOINTED that they did not have an essential ingredient on their tacos yet again they still charged me full price. 

After a mixed experience, here is a rundown of my review and suggestions for the owner:

- Food: Come over in the evening for tacos. I will never come at opening time, they were not ready to serve their clients. The wait is worth it later in the day when the tacos will be served with all the ingredients. Owner: Make sure you got EVERYTHING ready for your customers at opening time.

- Service: The women who work behind the cash register and the cleaning ladies, they were pretty cold, no smile, no "how you doing?" The taquero, no smile, but hey, thanks for making me some delish tacos.

- Location: Not enough area to sit inside/outside. I understand that it gets super crowded inside, therefore, have something like a long bar table area outside. I don't mind eating tacos standing up, but at least have a surface where I can put my plate and drink while I eat.

The way they separate the ordering areas by meat...please get rid of this. It causes confusion and unnecessary extra long lines for one type of taco. Instead, open at least three stations that serve all type of tacos, mulitas, etc. Also, don't have the security lady directing people where to go. I witnessed her running people out of the place by telling them that the line for asada was too long. Instead, have her do her job of making sure people don't steal tacos or get into a fight only. Also, clear the menu view...we get it, we love Mexico, but having "banderitas" hanging all over the place? obstructing the menu? not cool.

Overall, I will return next time I visit Las Vegas.
