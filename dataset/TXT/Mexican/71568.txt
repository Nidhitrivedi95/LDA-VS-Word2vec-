C2BR0TjNacoNzItPLUHTAA Try the Mahi Mahi burger with blackened seasoning!! 


I tried the fish tacos as well. They were delicious, but my fish burger was outstanding! The mahi was so juicy and tender!! The blackened seasoning was perfect. It was a generous portion of mahi mahi fillet, fully covering the bun. 

Inside is very casual, so I may have expected lower prices, but the quality was so good, that it made sense. $25 for 2 people with 1 burger, 1 order of tacos, and 1 drink (and 1 water). The staff all seemed very friendly, and attentive even though there is not a formal wait staff. I like the decor but the atmosphere is a little quiet.

Sometimes, I guess you can believe the hype! I look forward to returning and trying the coconut shrimp next time. 

If you have kids who love fish, this would be a great place to bring them. They offer a kid's menu.
