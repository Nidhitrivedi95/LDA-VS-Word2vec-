1HfkEkNhI6XJXkgrCTBKpw Love coming here for any occasion, but especially to watch a sports game.  TVs are set up all around, so you have a great view from any table.  I haven't usually had a problem getting a table, but you can call ahead for a reservation.  The food is really good and even pretty healthy, especially for a sports bar.  I have had the black bean burger, which is amazing if you are vegetarian or vegan.  Last night we got the pork nachos to snack on, which were messy but tasty.  I also love their fries.  If you're looking for a lighter snack, they have a couple different styles of popcorn to choose from; I have had both the sage & maple and the truffle bacon & parm, and would recommend either.  When I think about Urban Tap though, I really think about the tap--they have an excellent selection to choose from, regardless of what style of beer you prefer, and rotate their selection pretty frequently, great if you're looking to try something new!
