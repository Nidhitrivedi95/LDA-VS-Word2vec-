GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog Great service,  great food, clean,  just absolutely loved it.  Atmosphere was really nice.  Best coffee I have ever had . Their tacos were absolutely scrumptious the fusion between Chinese and Mexican food was absolutely a great idea . I would definitely go back but I would have to go back when my pockets are full it's a little pricey but well worth it
