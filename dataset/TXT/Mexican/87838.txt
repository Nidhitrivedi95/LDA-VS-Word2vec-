DljmXW8D07LVTA1Y69xosw First time here as I'm working here from out of town.  I saw the high review ratings and thought I would try it out.  I had the Huevo Rancheros and ordered an appetizer of the Carne Assad nachos to share.  The food was GREAT!!!! The only downside was our appetizer came out after our entrees and our food came out in waves.  It would be nice to have the appetizer first then the rest of the food put at the same time.  I still have it 5 stars for the freshness of the food and the customer service provided.
