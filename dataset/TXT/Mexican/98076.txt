ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA I luv this place! Beautiful layout, i wish we had sat outside because the inside was soooo loud (the reason why  i didnt give them 5 stars). had the ocotillo chicken, bahn mi and falafel burger, we shared. Oh and can't forget those fries! All was excellent. I can't wait to go back.but i will sit outside!
