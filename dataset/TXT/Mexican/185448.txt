Nut3ob6m58of2curSbrFWQ I attended a dance workshop on Sunday at the Rock Center for Dance, and when we broke for lunch, I decided to walk over to Don Tortaco. 
I've never eaten at one before, and it was close, and cheap.

I ordered the 2 cheese enchilada combo.

Service was polite, and the location was clean. 

The food was just "meh."  The cheese tasted funny, the tortillas didn't really seem done all the way...I didn't care for the rice at all.  

I'm not really a fan.  I will take Roberto's any day of the week over Don Tortaco, if given the chance.  It wasn't awful, but it wouldn't be my first choice.
