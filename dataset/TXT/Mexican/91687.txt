DyOzNIeXUksPNLXYHnB-oQ I don't give many 5s but this place deserved it!  Great food, great service and a full salsa bar!! Hard to ask for anything more.  We had a few vegetarian and grilled chicken tacos. MMMMM so good!  The Gordita and guacamole was also fantastic.  Definitely coming back here soon.  Pricing was very reasonable and the salsa bar was excellent.  Love this place!
