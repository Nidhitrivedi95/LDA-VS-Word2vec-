gY95Q7BVB636-tAcDqC9Ww Food was not even close to being authentic Mexican.  I have never had mexican topped with cheddar cheese.  We had 3 people in our party and they gave us 1 very small bowl of salsa and when we asked for another one we were told there would be a charge.  Terrible food and service and kinda pricy.  Would not recommend.
