GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog Open late for those who are looking for a bite to eat after a rachet night at Marquee but don't go out of your way to come here. It's not a very authentic Chinese restaurant but their Mexican cuisine might be better. We sat for 15 minutes before the server even came by and the restaurant was pretty empty. I tried the fried dumpling which was alright. It was fried like a crab Rangoon, with thick dumpling skin. The swallow a cloud noodle is just Hong Kong style wonton noodle soup. It has egg noodles, bok choy and wontons. The noodles were fine but no taste, the broth was bland, the wontons were mediocre. When pigs fly is a braised pork stuff steamed bun. The filling is sweet but decent. The rou jia mo sandwich is a more traditional dish that I was looking forward to. It's also a braised pork filling in a toasted bun shell but I was Sadly disappointed. The filling was so salty that it didn't even taste good. Not what I was expecting.
