RIIOjIdlzRyESw1BkmQHtw The tacos are quite good.. but to my surprise, the highlight of my meal was the guacamole.  It was probably the best guacamole I've ever had.. I was quite sad when it was done.  It was totally worth the drive from Toronto to stumble upon this place - and I'll make sure it's on my list of places to go back to when I'm back in Montreal.
