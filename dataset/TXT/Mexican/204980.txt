pup46G8qFBG8695RtbQNwA My father loves Los Dos Molinos, an Arizona tradition for as long as I've lived in the Valley of the Sun.  When coming to the Valley from South Carolina, his first stop is always at his favorite restaurant.  He even wears a Los Dos Molinos T-Shirt TO Los Dos Molinos, so you can imagine he's a pretty big fan. Today we went to the location on Chandler Blvd in the Ahwatukee area, for the first, and probably last, time.

What could possibly be so wrong that a restaurant I've been going to since I was a child has made it onto the "do not bother" list?  It ain't the food, because the food at any Los Dos Molinos location is going to be excellent.  Instead, it was the service that I found questionable, namely, the use of the Ipad in their billing.

I have never, EVER had a waiter announce to an entire restaurant of people what my bill has come to.  I have never seen a waiter stand over someone while they're deciding what tip to give, and frankly, it's a scam.  If you can't bother to print out a bill and give it to me, don't expect me to come back.

I'd suggest hitting one of the alternate locations if you want Los Dos, and do it before they all adopt this idiotic billing system.
