-Qkx7W0itbAApcG5lJuMFQ I should've reviewed as soon as i finished eating but i was in a hurry to watch Backstreet Boys concert 

But anyway, im back. I was actually surprised there was no line when i came on a saturday evening. Everybody was so busy going to it's neighboring In and Out burger they missed out on such good food right here. Place was pretty clean and there was adequate space for their guests...but let me get this over with and jump to my sushi burrito experience

I went ahead and ordered two from there best sellers. First was the Long beach which was oooh so good! First bite was heaven! Sushi was fresh and melty, sauces were rich and flavorful and my oh my was the seaweed wrap amazing! So fresh almost like they just got it right out of the ocean aahaha im over exaggerating but what the heck! Next one i got the was the Rockport since i wanted to try something spicy. It wasnt very overwhelming at all which was good. But i just had to say although it was good, Long Beach still stood out for me.

I had a really positive experience for my first sushi burrito and i just wish they'd have a few more stores open in other states say new jersey or new york perhaps? I hope they take that as a hint
