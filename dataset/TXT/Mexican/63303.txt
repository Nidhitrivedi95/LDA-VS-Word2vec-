aYE-oZFvSOHsyAtcpf0frQ One of those great surprises tucked away in a strip mall! Unquestionably the best Mexican I've found in the area. So far I've had chicken, steak, shrimp, and pork dishes; all high quality and well prepared; tender and not fatty. The flavor and quality has been especially noticeable in the dishes that showcase the meat: carne asada, chile verde (pork), all the shrimp dishes. Camerones a la Diablo-sauce was delicious! very spicy, my new favorite Diablo sauce, though my stomach was regretting it later that day--apparently lost my tolerance to spicy foods since moving to the Midwest. Luckily the other Camerones dishes are tasty too, so I can save Diablo for special occasions. Then to top it all off, the chile verde sauce was ridiculously good too! --great balanced lime, tomatillo, and spice. I'll always make sure someone at my table orders something with the verde sauce so I can at least get a taste.
