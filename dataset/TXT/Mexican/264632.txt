Wc9UpJhOcdSj7olZkz7SJA We both had the standard burger with fries and the vanilla shake.  The burger and the toppings were very  good and fresh.  I would rate them better than say The Habit.  The fries and shake were excellent.  The service was also excellent.

If you're looking for a really good $5 burger in a casual setting I can highly recommend The Stand.  Also - the outdoor seating was nice - it had a portable AC blower which made it comfortable on a day where the high had been in the low 100's.  Another benefit was that they weren't blasting music in your ear so you could have a conversation at a normal volume.
