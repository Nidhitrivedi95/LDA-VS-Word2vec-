b8fEuQPrf383f6pzdm8-1w I made reservations for 5 online and received a call the day of to confirm. Upon arrival we were immediately seated. The food was good. I got the chicken and corn enchiladas which were delicious. The chips were bottomless and always hot upon arrival. We sat outside and had a great seat for people watching The city. 

The only thing I'd mention is the fact that our waitress voiced her frustration over another tables lack of tip...telling us how pissed she was that they only left her a 7% tip and how she has to split her tips 3 ways at the end of the night and how she hadn't had a paycheck since January ... I mean really?? vent to your fellow co-workers not your patrons!
