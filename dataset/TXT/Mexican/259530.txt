Voeq7aGDmCGMjE_SQiHwRA Highly disappointed visiting the Pittsburgh location this past Friday night. We went to meet friends for dinner and drinks and ended up getting crammed into a smaller table and when I gave the hostess a look regarding the space she replied, "just sit anywhere. It doesn't really matter." To make matters worse there was clearly no air conditioning on or working at that time. The only ventilation was the front doors being opened. I personally don't enjoy eating dinner while dripping with sweat which is what we all did. I've never eaten that fast before just to get out of there to get fresh cool air. At one point someone came over to FINALLY open the front windows but the damage was already done with the heat. 

We have eaten at this establishment in Nashville and loved it, however the Pittsburgh location did not impress. I don't remember much of the food due to trying to stay cool and wipe the sweat from my face. 

On top of all of this, there is no contact info on their website to send an email to management.
