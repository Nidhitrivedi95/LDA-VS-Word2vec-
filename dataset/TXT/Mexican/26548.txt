3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ I have no idea why people like this place. I have been here several times with co-workers and dread it. The first time I went, I asked the waitress to surprise me with a taco trio. The flavors she picked sounded fantastic, but I was woefully disappointed. The flavors were drab and the tacos were greasy. I tried different combos afterwards, but none of them had a distinct flavor that left an impression. It's a cute concept being in an old church, but none of their food stands out.
