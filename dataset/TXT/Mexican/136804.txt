IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA Ok, so we stopped because I wanted Mexican for my birthday. Jordan our server greeted us & sat us. He literally sat down with us and answered every single question we had.. And offered his favorites on the menu! Since it was happy hour & my bday, why not get some drinks.. Strawberry mojito was to die for! At the end of the meal, Jordan brought out Flan with 2 candles for my birthday! 

Jordan, again thank you soooo much!! You are amazing, very knowledgeable & absolutely adorable!!
