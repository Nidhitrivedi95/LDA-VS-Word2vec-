ufwkkMd9yr9cFU1R5ONArg Came here for breakfast yesterday after wanting to come here for awhile and was not disappointed. I have tried every possible place in Etobicoke that you can get breakfast at over the years and I can now say that this may now be my new favourite spot. I loved the Art Deco vibe they had going on inside, the artwork on the walls and the music was awesome. I forget the exact name of what I ordered (will post a picture) but it was gluten free waffles with chicken, with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce on top. For my sides I had half salad half hash browns. OMG is all I can say, but it was absolutely delicious. The waffles were light and the chicken was a shredded texture, almost like pulled pork and had a great spice. The eggs were poached perfectly and had a beautiful runny orange yolk so you could tell they were truly organic (the menu says they use fresh, local eggs). They were not drowned in hollandaise either which was great. I cleaned my whole plate....there were several other things on the menu I wanted to try so I think I will be back very very soon, probably next week lol. What a great little place that makes delicious food, and underrated in my opinion (compared to the regular breakfast places in Etobicoke people go to). I also prefer this place to Goodlake btw, which is very close by.
