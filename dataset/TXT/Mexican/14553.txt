0xtBEP5zCu1153SoqqemLw I go here for lunch at least once a week, I recently brought my friend who is from Mexico here and loved it! The tacos el Pastor/Adobada are simply awesome, sweet and spicy and just perfect, if you go to a Mexican chain over this place you are missing out. Its a bit of a hole in the wall but do not let that fool you, its awesome. Keep it up.
