GoMlPsj-w62P58ZjUPYKmw LITERALLY WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE! If you have a gluten allergy I would avoid this place!  A friend and I walked in and we were greeted right away which was good. I asked if I could get the chorizo but they barely had any so I asked if they could make it fresh and right when I said that he started giving us attitude then whispering to his other coworker. Then my friend told him he is gluten free and that the spoons needed to be switched and he just seemed to be annoyed with everything! Rolling his eyes at us! Making remarks to us to his employees. Then I asked to speak to the manager and he didn't even really seem to care I will make sure to avoid this place for awhile!
