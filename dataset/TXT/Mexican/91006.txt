DYnFGGYU3SkrKT_G4djpYQ I have driven by this place a thousand times and always wanted to try it. Finally I did today and I was disappointed. The staff was very nice and the location is great. Since its "America's Taco Shop" I ordered the three assorted taco plate with some chips & salsa. All the meat was super dry and overall pretty tasteless. The food came out super quick, which is good from a service perspective, but I knew the food had probably been cooked earlier & sitting there for a while. As I ate each taco my intuition was right as it just tasted like re-heated meat and not much flavor with it. The chips weren't too fresh but not bad. The best part of the meal was the salsa as that was very good, but not enough to get me to go back. The service & the salsa kept this review at a 2-star instead of a 1-star.

I left thinking that this could be an amazing place because of the location and the patio, but the food was just disappointing. I would have to know that they upgraded their food in order for me to ever go back again.
