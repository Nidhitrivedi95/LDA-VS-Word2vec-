RyJIi1IP0UQ5qGbwazgsIA I normally have great things to say about this place. Always ask for flour tortillas chips. Might want to pass on the fideo. It generally has the consistency of spaghetti. Aside from that, the food is usually great. Lots of lower calorie options available.

Today, is not one of the days I have rave reviews. We sat there waiting for 30 minutes after being told it would be a 10 minute wait. They said no tables available. Do they not understand that we can see the patio and half the dining area from the waiting area? We could see 8 open tables in the patio. 5 open tables in the 1st dining area. We passed13 open tables when we were finally called inside. 

We waited another 15 minutes at our table before we were even acknowledged by our waitress. She took mine and my husband's drink orders, and ran off to go fill them. That would have been super awesome, except there were 5 of us at the table!!!

We ordered drinks for the rest of our party when she brought our drinks. She brought our food, and then hurried away again. I had to stop her at another table to remind her about drinks for the rest of my table. The drinks were for my children!! 

This was honestly the worst restaurant experience I've had in a long time. This used to be one of my favorite places. Now I'm not sure if I would ever recommend this to my out of town guests again. For a restaurant that gets so much resort business, you'd think they'd treat their customers better.
