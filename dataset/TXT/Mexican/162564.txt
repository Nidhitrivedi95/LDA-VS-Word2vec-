It has been around for more than a decade because of its consistently high quality. However, it is not a cute gringo restaurant with a strolling mariachi band. It has about 25 seats with a tv blaring a Spanish language channel soccer game. The clientele are from the old sod, but everyone is welcome. I only wish they were closer to where I live.
