We order chips and salsa. The red sauce was more of a spaghetti sauce so we got verde in hopes of spice and it had none. 

Got jalapeño poppers they might have been spicy but you can't taste them due to the super thick breading. 

Fajitas beef was eatable but no favor. The vegetables where not cooked at all and the amount of sour cream you get in laughable. They might as well not include it at all. Chili's has better fajitas. 

$101 later... I we are still hungry.
