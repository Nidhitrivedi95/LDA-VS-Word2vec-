Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Food was very good. But the service was extremely subpar. Waiters were terribly slow and unresponsive. Gave me attitude when I brought up the issue. Overall, less than decent dining experience. Terrance Cafe was much better. Surprised to be treated this way as suite guests. Servers need to be benchmarked. These servers are a disgrace to their chief.
