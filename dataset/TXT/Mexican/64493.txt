Been here 3 times now and I am less impressed with the place each time. This time was the usual Margaritas (always good - but just some house pre-mix so they cant really screw it up), along with some Orange Blossom??? draft beers that are surprisingly tasty, but seem to be lacking in alcohol content.

We ordered chicken soft tacos (which were a small corn shell instead of the expected flour). I thought they were very bland in comparison to the red and green salsas they supplied with the complementary chips.
We also ordered the grande burrito (deep fried). The only thing "grande" about it was the price. It, too, was very bland IMO (or maybe my taste-buds were just still on vacation after being burnt by the red salsa???). Either way, the size made it nowhere near worth the $12 asking price.

One thing that was somewhat disturbing- we ordered our food and it literally arrived like 1-2 minutes later. WTF? She said they put our order in front of a larger table.  OK? Now for the disturbing part- This must mean that every time I go for mexican food, all they do is make me wait 10-15 minutes for my food, when in reality, this is just so that I think that they are actually cooking something? Good to know.

The service started out attentive, but since one of us is a chips and salsa junkie (not me) they seemed to start ignoring our flag downs for more chips on the 3rd request. I figured since the tiny tacos and burrito they presented did not satisfy, maybe that was why we were still hungry after finishing our orders? Either way, Management listen up... don't be stingy with your tiny bowls of chips and salsas!

On the plus side- The one thing I do like about this location is the atmosphere, but since we only end up here due to the BMW dealer being nearby, here's hoping the car will not need any services for a long while.
