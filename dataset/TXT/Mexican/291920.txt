YTmnXQxBuNwU_L3uQGH2-A The food quality has dropped! The margaritas are still the very best around anywhere. The service is great but what's with the food? Being from San Antonio and a chef myself I just don't think it's that hard to make but yet they seem to serve yuck sometime. Come-on guys get it together!!!
