e2ApirIzYID9xIye0r_gKQ Went in for dinner today and as always, the food was amazing!! Everything is always fresh and made in a reasonable amount of time. We have gone in last visits but today was different. As soon as we sat down we were greeted by a girl named Aaliyah. She asked if we needed refills, took our trash as needed to be thrown away, and constantly checked up on us. She was super friendly for a place who doesn't wait tables. This girl deserves a promotion, she makes your restaurant look amazing. Keep it up! Highly recommend this place!
