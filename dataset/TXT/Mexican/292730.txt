yVanb8fVmGtQFEYw05lZUQ My husband always brings us to eat at Pepe's. It is extremely helpful that they are open 24-hours and serve everything on their menu at all hours of the day. The meat (we prefer the carne asada and pastor) are always very savory and never dry. The tortillas never fall apart and their beans are to die for, figuratively speaking of course. The horchata and other aguas are next to the soda machine so you can get unlimited refills and that is definite benefit. 

The dining area is moderately sized and very close together. There are gender specific bathrooms. There is juke box available where you can select your own music. I've never been to this location, or any other for that matter, that are ever not busy. Nonetheless, the cashiers always go through the line pretty fast and accurate.  

Because it is in a shopping center there is more than enough free parking lot parking and stores nearby to walk off the food after you're done eating. The decor is a map of Mexico along with their mascot (a rat with a sombrero).
