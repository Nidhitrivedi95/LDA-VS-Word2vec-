C2BR0TjNacoNzItPLUHTAA We loved this place. We've been wanting to come in for such a long time and can't say how happy we were to finally do so.We both had the coconut shrimp which was fantastic. It comes with a pineapple chile dipping sauce that we we really liked. The service was great. Very friendly and helpful. We'll be back to try something else.
