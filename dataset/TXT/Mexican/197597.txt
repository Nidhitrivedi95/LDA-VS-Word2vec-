OYmhgXMMmFdxLRyTazl-hg We came for the 2nd time for the taco happy hour. $2CAD per taco. Tacos were pretty good! Good service, and we got to try a variety of hot sauces. I now have a new favorite hot sauce so i'm pretty stoked about that! I will definitely be returning in the near future. Thanks for a memorable meal!
