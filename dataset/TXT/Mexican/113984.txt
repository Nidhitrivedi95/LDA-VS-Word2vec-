GETVAz5SCk8rFziexV54Aw I must write a review for my new Favorite Mexican Restaurant!  My husband and I have had dinner here twice in the last month.  The first time we ordered the Chicken Tomatillo Enchiladas and the Steak Asada Quesadilla.  The second time, we shared the Steak Fajitas.  Everything was SO good!  It is family-owned and everything is made to order.  Fresh and delicious!  I don't understand the poor reviews here because our dishes were all very well-balanced.  I must mention also that the Margaritas are just wonderful.  It's a little hard to find, as it is tucked back in a strip mall, but if you love good traditional Mexican food, you'll love this place.  We'll be back here again very soon!

1/3/2017 -- I posted my original review months ago...and we still LOVE this place!  We try to go about once a week and have tried just about everything on the menu, but keep coming back to the Chicken Tinga Tostadas and the Carnitas Platter.  In November, my Mother-in-law turned 90 and we had a birthday luncheon for 12 guests here.  They were so nice and accommodating and it was a perfect day.  I just cannot say enough nice things about No Que No.
