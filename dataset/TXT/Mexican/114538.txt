gGt00WW8sNY2Sop7jYa7Tw YASSSSSSSSSSSSS.. I have been dieing to get to this lil mexican spot and all i can say it was worth the wait. Aside from the decor and lighting it was a really cool vibe in here. I came here with two of my friends and we all loved our food.Our sever was more than great and when she brought our food out she came with a team we were like geesh we feel like royalty here no lie! I had the melanese sandwhich, and i ordered two margaritas the bakersfield and the pineapple margarita, i came with every intention to order their seasonal watermelon rosemary margarita which our server mentioned they are no longer serving those at the moment i had my taste buds all ready so i have to catch that one the next time around. Oh and how can i  forget my guacamole and chips the guacamole was to die for with the almost a hint of spice very good. I will definelty re visit this place of business very soon !
