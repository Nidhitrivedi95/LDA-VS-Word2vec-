_H4GXECi4nHfJTz4dsQV_w Oh my gosh! So so good! We'd heard great things from everyone who'd been here and of course their reviews support that praise. We walked in and were greeted immediately by a very pleasant young man who was experienced enough to know that we were first-timers so he took the time to give us some information about their process and products. Lots of great things on the menu and when we finally made our choices we were NOT disappointed! The food was wonderfully delicious! The burritos were very very filling! I had the studio fit burrito and I would so get it again! A thumbs up all the way around - location, environment, food taste, quantity, and quality, and service. 5! 5! 5! 5! 5! 5! 5!
