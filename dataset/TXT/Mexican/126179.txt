hU7z5Jtl57RIODS0hPg9Ug I am so picky about my mexican food it's not even funny. If this review were based on the excellent customer service it would be a 5-star-er. Their carnitas taco was to die for should have probably ordered like 5 of them. Didn't like the carne asada at all, a weird flavor and was super chewy.
