1Vvxx-9AoINg8TJXOZgEHg Awful food. We went here for dinner and ended up sending 2 of 5 dishes back. Of the 3 dishes we kept we had a few bites because the food was inedible. Service was not very good either. The manager seemed annoyed we didn't like the food and didn't even apologize for the poor quality of food sent out.  Do not recommend this place to anyone.
