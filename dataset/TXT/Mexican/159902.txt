KwufI-XUy8Vs2cnJ8n7F6w I have been wanting to try this place for months! Today I had a long day at work and thought I would pick up chicken from this new place for dinner! I went thru the drive thru and all the staff I interacted with was very nice. When my boys came home and sat down to eat they go "don't buy this chicken anymore!" I thought the same when I ate my double chicken avocado salad. Not a fan
