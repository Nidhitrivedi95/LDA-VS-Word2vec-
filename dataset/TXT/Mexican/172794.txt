mES9E5K4HbYoPFXGv0pUuw I have been here twice with my girlfriend and both times it was awesome! The service was absolutely phenomenal. They were super friendly and genuine both times I was there. 

The food is excellent as well! Huge portions for an inexpensive price! I had their chicken quesadilla and it was delicious, ginormous, and under $9. 

Perfect if you want a quick sit down meal. You order at the counter and they bring your food to you. 

I would definitely recommend this place.
