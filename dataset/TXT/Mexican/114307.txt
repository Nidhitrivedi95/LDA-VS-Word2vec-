gg0zeYKlmvk_rScipyOyKw We ordered the Chile relleno plate which comes with 2 rellenos with a side of rice and beans. The beans and rice were just like any other place. The rellenos were decent. Not spicy at all which was great because my bf is sensitive to spicy food! I love that they have grilled onions at their salsa bar!! They gave the food extra flavor. And the salsas are good too. This place is definitely good enough to come back to. I'm looking forward to trying some of their burritos.
