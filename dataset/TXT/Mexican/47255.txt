7WZHJyMln_Ai44PJ3_Q1Qg I think there may be two different food trucks and only a single entry on here for Yelp.  I am not sure of this but I suspect this is the case.  I went to a food truck in front of a convenience store and it wasn't good at all.  The meat was so stringy and chewy that I could barely even eat it.  The tacos fell apart and made a mess.  I would have been better off eating them out of a blender since it was a total disaster.

I also really didn't like the tortillas used at all.  They are those cheap one you can get 100 of for like $2 at Food Lion in the bag with the yellow label and the Mexican flag on it.
