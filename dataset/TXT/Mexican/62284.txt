AVYfBU4WhaQ9YVFPmApL3w I have gone twice since this location opened.  The fare is not at all tex-mex but authentic Mexican.  As other reviewers noted, they bring a great variety of salsa with the chips.  It is very fresh and flavor able, with different heat levels.  By far my favorite dish so far is the carnitas.  Fantastic flavor and so tender.  It comes with two sides, beans and rice, the same bland types you get at all Mexican places.  I would like to see some lettuce and tomato on the side as we'll.    it would be good to see maybe special plate combinations with carnitas.
   I have also had the combo fajitas and they were very good.    Came out sizzling an the best part the vegetables were not overlooked.  My wife had the chicken enchiladas and they were excellent.  Very good seasoning on both.  The service was good when we went both times.
  I ordered the house margarita and although the flavor was real good, it could have a little more tequila in it.  The menus are terrible.  Bring a magnifying glass if you want to read it.  
  We will definitely be going back.
