The website says that you don't have to make a reservation so my boyfriend and I went and the lady told us it would be about 40 minute wait time which is understandable for a small place and even after that she had the audacity to tell us that they take long to prepare the food as if she did not want us to stay there. After that we just left, never coming here again. If I could give it less than one start I would.
