DLwpjhatiSRN7QqZQwokSw I really should have known that this place was going to disappoint me by the empty patio - a rarity on a hot summer day; but I thought hey, I could be wrong, it's happened before.

we entered the store- and the cool AC sent me straight to heaven - I thought, see? I was wrong - well, I was.
I bought 4 soft tacos - one of each kind - they didn't have any cherizo one left, which was disappointing but I thought, well, now I can try new things; I shouldn't have.

There were 2 kids serving; no green or red salsa left- which was disappointing to my friend. What made it worse was the fact that when my friend walked out the door, the boy pulled out a massive container of salsa to fill them up :O 
The "fresh tortilla" was not fresh- maybe they did make it that day, but it was 6pm on a humid day and and what you made at 5am just may not keep. Maybe it was meant to taste doughy, but I've had home made tortilla and that was not the case.

3 tacos out of 4 were - unsavory - but by the time I got to the ONE that was good my appetite was severely ruined and I could not stomach it. 

Now, I'm a BIG fan of food, Mexican being my top 5 - from that, tacos and burritos tickle my fancy any hour of the day - I would eat just about anything but not this. I was STARVING.FAMISHED but this was not going down. 

WHY I paid $12 for 4 unsavory tacos and a warm can of grape crush, I have no clue -because Burrito Boys and Chippy's were in walking distance... but I took one for the team and now you know not to go to this location. I hear the other locations are great; I'll have to go try, even if just to revive my love for tacos.
