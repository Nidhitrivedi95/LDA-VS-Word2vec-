n3kuSEwXUn3acFjmKiE16Q It's very rare that a place truly impresses me. This place knocked it out of the park. Just stopped in today for takeout on a recommendation from a friend. First of all, the place is so dang clean that you could eat off the floor. Very impressed by that! I ordered a chorizo breakfast burrito and rice and beans. PHENOMENAL. Fresh authentic Mexican food. Not greasy. High quality. Prices are completely fair for the quality of the food. I will definitely return to this place and bring friends with me.
