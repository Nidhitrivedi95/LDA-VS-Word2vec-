GC5wcui5uejRZTi8OCNPkQ This was my first time visiting Mi Casa Grill Cantina inside the Silverton Casino. I will start by saying that the decor inside the restaurant was beautiful. It seemed almost cave-like. Bright colors, furniture, etc. 

Now for the cons. Our server was very nice but seemed to be overwhelmed. My friends and I had asked for certain ingredients to be removed, certain type of liquor for our cocktails, etc. and he completely forgot. He also seemed to never come back to our table unless we asked one of assistant servers for another drink or water. When we were finished with our meal, he asked if we wanted dessert and we said yes. At that, this would be an up-sell for the restaurant. Again, totally forgot to bring a menu over and disregarded to come back and check on us to ask for the bill. It seemed the other tables around us were being served properly...except for us.

Now for the food. The first batch of tortilla chips were awful. All broken pieces and tasted like they were sitting out for a few days. When we asked for another basket of chips (to the assistant server), they tasted even worse and completely stale. For my entree, I ordered the Chicken & Steak Fajitas. Meat was cooked well and veggies were done nicely. It could have used a bit more flavor as well. The refried beans were a bit under warm and the "spanish rice" was dry. 

Overall, I will not be coming back. There are so many better options to choose, including El Dorado; Bandito's, etc. Take this recommendation and move on to the next choice on your list.
