oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ We were in search of someplace to eat with a party of nine in Vegas. Trust me it was no easy feat. We stumbled upon Chayo and let me tell you, it was awesome!! We had an assortment of food, front the Chayo burrito to the machego burger, superb! Service was outstanding. Will be back!
