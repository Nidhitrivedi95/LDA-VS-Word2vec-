QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA By far the best food and price we've had so far. Way better value than even the food courts in the casinos and on the strip. I had BBQ chicken nachos. My husband had buffalo chicken nachos. We shared the free margarita from Yelp. All was delicious, portion size was huge. Wait staff very nice, and not at all busy on a Monday just before noon. Did not see any scorpions in the tank.
