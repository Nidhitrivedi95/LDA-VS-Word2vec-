x2CLU-qw2Hpwu2vSGLEorg I've been living close to Eastern and Trop for ... like 8 years already but haven't had a chance to check out this place yet. And ... encouraged by great reviews (and :) ... as I find myself following B.K already) I decide to give Las Pupusas a shot. And it definitely lives up to its name ... I was hungry like a wolf so I ended up ordering 4(!) pupusas - 2 with Chicharron (Pork) and 2 with Loroco y Queso (Cheese).
And that was my mistake :) because when girl gave me bag with my food it seemed a little to heavy. They put like a whole pound of spicy cabbage, good 8-9 oz of that liquid stuff you pour on top of it (I just don't know the name of it in Spanish) and 4 good size pupusas.
I did ask them to cook pupusas crispy because it does taste better.

So, bottom line:
+ quality
+ quantity !
+ price ... (although it's probably average for this type of places but still) .. my bill was like $7
- well ... I'm not sure for the rest of the menu ... I will have to try something else but I'll reserve 5 start rating for places that really WOW me. This restaurant is a great value for a casual meal but nothing fancy. So 4 stars - solid GOOD!
