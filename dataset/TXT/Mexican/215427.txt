QYuojrlW94mpEwnp0uUIWA I lived in this area at one time and could not find La Parilla when a friend suggested we eat there. It's tucked away in the first shopping center after Eastern on Flamingo.

I wasn't sure what to make of the place--Was it a Mexican food spot? Was it a burger joint? I stopped trying to put it in a box and have accepted that it is it's own creature. I can tell you this--it's definitely a fast food spot. 

What I get:
*lemon pepper chicken wings (pro tip: get them cooked extra crispy)
*carne asada tacos 

This is a small shop that puts out consistently good food.  They have a diverse menu (which generally concerns me; La Parilla gets it right) so there is something for everyone to try and enjoy.  I've been here plenty of times and have eaten my two trusty dishes more times than I can count. You might like the wild burger options or the Mexican sodas.  I can only say that I have never been disappointed. It's greasy fast food and they cook it well.  What more needs to be said?
