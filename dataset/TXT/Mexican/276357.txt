Xg7Gt8vlSPxSypDQQSVsAA Love this place so much! I've only been twice but my food has been delicious each time!! This place definitely has not made the Mexican food "Tex-Mex." It tastes authentic and the flavoring is great. Service is fast and friendly. The chalupas and fajitas are great options! My number one choice for Mexican in this area, hands down.
