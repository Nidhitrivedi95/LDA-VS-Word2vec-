VRwT0pscR5vESCrAnUpNwQ Amazing place for tacos. I was so happy not to be disappointed for once and Wilbur actually surpassed my taco expectations. The salsa buffet and collection of hot sauces was a lot of fun to explore. Any of their tacos seem to be delicious. I would recommend the chicken taco that comes in a hard shell with moist juicy chicken stuffed inside. La carnita was delicious also, they definitely don't skimp on the meat here. 

The only meh thing was the Mexican corn. The spices and toppings was delicious with just the right amount of spice. Unfortunately the corn itself was a little old and not sweet as I hoped it would be. No matter,  the food was still worth a return trip in the future!!!!!
