cwCLcQns_SSExsBCzWNQDA WTF!!!! The burritos used to be large!, I have ordered the block for 2 days and received 4 different sizes of burritos, I complained to staff and they said the owner said to reduce the size.  The price or name did not change.  The place is called PHAT burrito, not medium burrito, or skinny burrito.  Get this fixed!!!!! The taste is the same but the standards in the place are degrading, floors dirty, bugs, general unkempt appearance.  Whimsical is cool but it is looking a bit neglected.

Fix this Shit!!!!
