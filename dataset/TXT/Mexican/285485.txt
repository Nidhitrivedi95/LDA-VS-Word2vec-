y3RlbCN0UrDdLnjSF9NkXA Open for 30 years must be doing something right.... food is above fast food but by far not the best I have had. The soup is killer but any kind of salad you order- well might as well open a bag from the store... not an item to go out of the way for. Free chips and salsa. The best thing I have had so far is on the appetizer menu it's steak w chese on flour tortillas and it's great!!
