5-fpVbhoZcuSWatzof5YIg I've eaten at Rubio's in California and always loved their fish tacos, but this is the first time I've been to one in Las Vegas, and unfortunately it wasn't what it used to be, or wasn't as good as at the other location.  I ordered a fish taco, what they're  known for, and the only flavor that stands out is the onion.  The service was good--I was the only one in line--it was clean, the staff was friendly and I got my order in a timely manner, so that's why they get a three star rating.  Raw onion is notoriously overpowering and it really took over the taste of the taco to the exclusion of all other flavors, including the salsa I added to the mix.  I miss the nice fresh taste I got in California where the lime and fish flavors combined with the corn tortilla and cabbage.  Good for service, fell flat in the flavor department.
