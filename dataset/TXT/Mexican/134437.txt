iikAHVLZrZn7Zy1aEPD25A I hate to say it, this location has completely gone to sh!t. They used to have friendly counter staff, good portions, and a clean restaurant. Now, the restaurant is virtually empty and not a clean table in the house. 

Don't worry, I'll wet napkins in the water fountain in front of your employee and wipe down my own table. The trash cans are overflowing, so should I leave my trash on my table? I'm sure it will get cleaned up before next shift... The men's bathroom smells like a typical 7/11 backdoor restroom. A little bleach and new mop heads never hurt anything.

They also load their iced tea with ice so it's completely watered down; I don't drink soda. This always drives me crazy. Have contacted their management and corporate and they never change. Not sure if ownership or management has changed, but this went from my favorite Chipotle to one of the worst.

Oh, I had 45 check-ins here. You lost another loyal patron.
