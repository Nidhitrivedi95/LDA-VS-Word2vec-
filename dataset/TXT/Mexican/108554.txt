frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A As the name implies, it's an eatery that specialized in tacos and wide variety of salsas.  Among 5 of us, three ordered tacos and were pleased with the food, and two persons ordered the Quesa: La Condesa Mahi Mahi and Sonora Arrachera Quesa.  The quesa is like a jumbo empanada  made with corn flour dough then deep fried. We ordered it at the waitress recommendation.  I'm sure the soft corn flour dough makes it very hard to stay together during the frying process however the creation is way too doughy and heavy, with little filling. Nobody ordered burritos. If we come back again, I'd definitely recommend my friends/family to stay with the tacos.
