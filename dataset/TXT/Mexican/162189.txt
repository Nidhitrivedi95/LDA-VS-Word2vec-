l1GJnB9TJgGgEeI4at1M0A Went to El Fresco's on a friend's recommendation, it was great!!! I had the carne asada torta, excellent I'm not really sold on GMO free meat but their meat is fantastic, everything else was great too, the chips, the house pickled condiments, even the plates, yes they have actual plates to eat on and silverware. Great little place a little hard to find but worth looking.
