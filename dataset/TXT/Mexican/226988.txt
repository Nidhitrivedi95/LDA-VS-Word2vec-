S_bG5WWbtNXhhY9Y0GTcSg The staff here are amazing.  Very attentive and always carrying a smile.  The restaurant itself is very clean.  The decor is very refreshing and the seating is plentiful.  We chose to sit outside which can lead to being forgotten, but the wait staff checked on us regularly.  

The food wasn't fantastic, but not bad.  My wife had the Mushroom Omelet.  The onions and mushrooms were tasty, but the eggs were bland.  It seemed to lack simple flavorings such as salt.  She ordered a muffin as well which was very soft, fluffy and tasty!  I had the short rib sandwich.  It to was just bland.  The short ribs really didn't have any flavor other that of cooked beef.  I chose a side order of fries which unfortunately were raw.  This was a disappointment especially for the price point of entrees.

Give this place a little bit to get in their groove.  If they can spice up the food a little, this place will be another phoenix hotspot.
