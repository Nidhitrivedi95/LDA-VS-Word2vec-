CuP3Z3CUZrV22FytT_uZ1A Stopped in to Chipotle for dinner. I ordered a bowl with double chicken, white rice, and veggies, a bowl with chicken, brown rice and veggies, and crispy steak tacos. At 5:45 PM, not only did I not wait in line, the order was done fast and correctly. I ate the food at home and it was delicious.

In reality, this was one of the best Chipotle experiences I've had. Most of the time at other locations, the line is out the door. They had plenty of staff on hand and there were many people dining in.

Since this is the closest Chipotle to home, it will be my go to spot for my fix.
