lBgH5QveRunGHsBS6rj5iw Pretty much the same menu as big brother Cozemel's and still a nice place to enjoy dinner with friends. Nice staff, good Margarita's and clean place.
Such an upgrade from the last place.
Mexican tacos are good but i prefer El Rodeo's tres tacos more. Have not had a bad meal or time either sitting inside or on the patio.
Come on down and enjoy some Parma Mexican food.
