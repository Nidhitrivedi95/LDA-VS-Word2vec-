MtxfrJwF-OTvJGyWV1PfzQ My favorite plate is camarones culichi ! 
Everything i have had here is good, but culichis are my favorite! Only thing I dont like is that they dont have many tables and we kind of feel like we are obligated to get up as soon as we are done for others who are waiting to be seated.
