XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Wine selection docent exist unless you buy their overpriced spanish wine. No Cabernets or good California Whites available. Food is WAY OVERPRICED for what you get. Small portions and very expensive. I don't mind dropping a few hundred on dinner but at this place after I ate I felt like I was given the once over by a staff of used car salesman. Being local I know there are hundreds of better places to eat for the money. A real shame I used to like this place a lot.
