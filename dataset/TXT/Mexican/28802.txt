3u5el8pjsc6igwPlls0_6Q Almost gave it a five....just becuase its different than your standard.  We need more of these before Trump puts up the wall and forbids authentic tacos! Not a fan of the chicken tacos, steak was excellent with the mesquite taste. I would prefer a good corn tortilla.  Salsa was excellent and not hot at all......i tried every salsa they had.   For sure going back.
