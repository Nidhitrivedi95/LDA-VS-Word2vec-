SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA Went here for happy hour and dinner recently with a party of four.  Drinks were fine, prices good (especially happy hour), food was so so.  Although their soup was excellent and their chicken was good, the beef was just rough.  Came out grey and just looked gross.  Flavor wasn't good either.  We all said the same thing about the beef, no matter what it was on: a taco, burrito, fajita, whatever.  Seating outside is nice.

It's a decent place for happy hour and cheap apps, but the food wasn't what it should've been.
