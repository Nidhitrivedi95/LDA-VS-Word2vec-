4Pb7SlTK89uSdqOwMNM35A Simply put; my wife says these were the best nachos she has ever eaten. I can agree they come close to the best. Huge portion that could serve six. Hat is the only thing we had. The server was polite and it didn't take too long. Next time we are in Vegas we plan to have their nachos again.
