zJGtD3y-pAIGNId4codEEg It was our first time here. The food was great and I loved the tomatillo salsa. Our tortas were yummy. I'm always a bit nervous bringing my baby to restaurants because you never know if they'll get loud and crazy. The 5 stars goes to our wonderful server who went out her way to accommodate our baby. Kids eat free and she brought out beans and a pancake. She kept asking if we needed anything and she was so pleasant and made us feel comfortable 

Hopefully we'll come again soon because the menu looks great and all day breakfast, I'm all for it!
