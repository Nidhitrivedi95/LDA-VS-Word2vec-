UoRSHohdGuzfrpydZ9j0Lg Lotsa expectations, hype was built up by reviews of other yelpies! Unfortunately I have tasted better mexican food in other smaller cities of Ohio. Chele Releno was not even close to what I had expected. Quesadialla was ok. Bland guacamole, salsa was the only good thing I tasted. Flan was not very rich and creamy as I had expected. Camarones Borrachos was passable. Tasted the cactus for the first time and it wasnt as bad. 
I'm not going to go back for more.
Staff is extremely friendly and nice, 5 star for good service.
