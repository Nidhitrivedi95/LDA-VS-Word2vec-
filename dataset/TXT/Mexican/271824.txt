WRsx6oYB8vtEM24auz275A I dined here with a few friends one evening during the week. There weren't too many people dining. Between my friends and I, all of our food was really tasty and filling! The prices are great and what they should be. The service could have been just a tad better, the waitress was absent most of our time there. Regardless, I would definitely recommend this place and I'll be back some day soon!
