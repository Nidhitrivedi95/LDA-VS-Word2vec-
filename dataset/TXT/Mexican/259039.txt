VO-p1uczeMbzH8bEAv-RgA Their green chile (anything) is phenomenal. Been there for both lunch and dinner, and they give you nice big portions. Parking is a bit cramped since you have to share it with Cheba Hutt, Cornish Pasty, a Dentistry, and some other places. I had to knock off a star because median that separates the booths is flimsy and so your neighbors are prone to rocking your booth/drinks/plates.
