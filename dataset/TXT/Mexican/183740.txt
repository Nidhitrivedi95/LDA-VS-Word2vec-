NOfbzTpQ7hrt6ZbJVeXUUw Came here with a group from work. We had reservations. Well I mean we were suppose to. When we showed up they had no idea who we were or what our reservation was. Our reservation was for 5, by the time they checked us in, arranged the tables for us, it was almost 5:30. There was not a lot of people in this restaurant and the service was very slow. They really weren't on top of it. When we finally did get some drinks, one of our girls drinks that was brought out had lipstick on it. Full on lip imprint on the glass, when we mentioned it to the waitress, she told us all to check our cups. Wow. Appetizers were good but overall a lot of us won't be returning.
