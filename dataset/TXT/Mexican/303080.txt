ZXC9HaHWeHnKKtbqX74Q_A This place is outstanding!!  Best Mexican food in this price range.  The burritos are amazing, and the fish tacos are epic.  We come here often... great place!

** Update 2017:  Sadly the day has arrived.  Senor Taco has *significantly* raised prices to where the point that this is no longer the great deal it used to be.  I'll still come here once in awhile, but almost nine bucks for the enchilada meal a bit much.
