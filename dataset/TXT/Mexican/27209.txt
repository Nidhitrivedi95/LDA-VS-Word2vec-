3FiTfmHWr1TbDbaepDrC2A Great a new Mexican place to try! Don't waste your money.  Ordered a spicy green Chile pork burrito. There was nothing spicy, green, or Chile about it. The sauce was actually brown and had the taste of sugary brown gravy. As for the actual burrito they use a fresh tortilla that is about 14 inches round and is stuffed with everything but green chile. They used literally 3 table spoons of pork in a burrito that was 7 inches long 3 inches wide  and 2 inches tall.  No shortage of beans and rice.
