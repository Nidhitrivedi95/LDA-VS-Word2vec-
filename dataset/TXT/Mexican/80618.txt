CZhc8YXdFLhAI4ViC2ERTg Fantastic service with Ignacio. Great food! We ordered taco salad and pork green chile burrito. The order came with chips and salsa as well as bean dip and jalapeños. Really good. My meal - burrito- came with a chicken based soup , which was just OK IMO. Atmosphere was very inviting. If I lived in Vegas, I'd be a regular here to be sure.
