OTcBXjDkViDPds4Lxy8KIQ Great food and drinks-service is minimal- you order at the bar.  Looks like a lot of their business is takeout.  But worth the inconvenience as the food is great-excellent stuffed sopas and tamales-mushroom stuffed with sausage, smoked chicken,red chili shrimp, green chili stew- all were were excellent.  The kitchen is open and you can smell the smoked chili as they are cooking your meal.  Happy hour specials from 3-5 are great value.
