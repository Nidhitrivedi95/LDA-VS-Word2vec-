Interesting variety on the menu and great salsa bar.  What more could you ask? Authentic Mexican food, well prepared. I had the carnitas (a pork stew) with salsa verde, one of the evening's specials, for $8.00. Came with rice and beans.  More food than I could possibly eat and delicious.  I  took half home with me.  Drinks are also  very reasonable. Mexican sodas in the bottle are $2 and Mexican beers are $3.50. I will be back soon and bring people with me.  Even if it is on the other side of town for you, it is well worth a drive.
