BgQ5ob0QiZfO5YbgI7VyFw Don't be fooled by this restaurant's exterior because the quality of the food and it's inviting atmosphere is worth experiencing! I am ashamed to say it took me a year of living so close before I even tried it and it was a waste of a year. The food options are plentiful and you can't go wrong with almost any dish you order there.
