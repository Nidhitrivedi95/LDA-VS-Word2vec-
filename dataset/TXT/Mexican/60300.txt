aLIJSHJfLQuFu3CamjOS2Q As visitors we always look for places the locals go and Rita's appeared to be just what we were looking for. It was great!  The atmosphere and neighborhood may not be fancy but since it is right off the freeway what do expect?  Service was very friendly and efficient, the food was great (especially the salsa). We highly recommend this place!
