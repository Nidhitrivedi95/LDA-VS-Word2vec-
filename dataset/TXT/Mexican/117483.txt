gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw We came for restaurant week for lunch. We had some great choices we had the halibut ceviche and the kale chopped salad. We also had the calamari to start. All 3 were great, we get calamari everywhere. It's one of my daughter's favorites, it's was great I loved the breeding and the sauce was very tasty. We had the Cuban sandwich and the Meyer lemon chicken, both were great. The sandwich was full of flavor with great crispy fires. I really enjoyed the chicken. It came with a refreshing potato salad and a chimichurri sauce that went great with the chicken. The service was 5 star, Nicole and her bussers gave us great service. We had several managers that stopped to make sure everything was great. Chef Lorena graciously stopped over checking on us and talked with my daughter. She loved it. We are locals and have found a reason to come to the strip. The inside of the restaurant is charming.
