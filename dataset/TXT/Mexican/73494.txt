Cfry9-vvuseDsbF3Q2H8ew The food here is really awful. I ordered the veggie nacho style fries and it was a soupy mess. There were hardly any beans and the beans that were there were tasteless. Nothing had any flavor, not even the salsa. The guacamole was runny and the fries were soggy and greasy. I watched the cook in the back appear to make my food so I am genuinely curious as to how my fries were also cold when I opened them 30 seconds after I got them. I have tried a Rivas on Desert Inn and I thoroughly enjoyed the same dish there which is why I tried this location. Unfortunately, I will not be back.
