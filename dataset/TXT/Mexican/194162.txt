orUB2tOqvyAQSQPnIZDlCA Hmmm...sat at the bar to watch the game and eat some good Mx food.  Food was great and drinks were good when I could get them.  The service at the bar was horrible!  I had to beg my server for attention.  I am not even sure there is a bartender that works there as a "bartender".  I used to love this place but now, eh.  Sad.
