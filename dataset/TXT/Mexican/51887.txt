9ehTNgvu0vZgHjWkQqF6KQ I love this restaurant. Never had bad service. Chips and Spicey or Milder Salsa always comin, Ground Beef, Cheese Enchiladas, Beans & Rice, Shredded Beef Tamales with Guacamole and Sour Cream. Always Good. Always a Hot Plate. Virgin Daiquiris and Virgin Pina Coladas excellent.
