cYhv7XVpqJIpb6BLzZBaFQ Not often in Berea for much of anything, but made a trip out to finally check out Campus Grille. Turns out they were closed so quickly yelped for a new joint...and Maya it was. 

The scoop: 
Service was on point. All were Mexican and it was nice to exercise my native tongue. This is the definition of tex-mex food. Huge portions and a joy to look at. Flavors are there. Sad not to see a mole on the menu or actual queso fresco atop my enchiladas, but how many people outside Mexico/SoCal understand how important queso fresco is to enchiladas!? 
Margaritas were cheap and sweet. Go jumbo. They got oomph. 

All in all, the lady was extremely happy which made me happy. That's a win.
