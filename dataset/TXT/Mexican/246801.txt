Their burgers remind me of California burger joint burgers and they have amazing onion rings, fries, and their fried zucchini are fantastic.  The only thing is that they don't carry Coke products, they have Pepsi instead.  Also, the prices are kind of high even though I think the food quality is worth it I advise you try their daily specials.  On Friday they offer the Farmer Burger combo with fries and a drink for only $6.99.  The only non-burger item I have tried is their country fried chicken breakfast bowl and I regretted not getting their burger.
