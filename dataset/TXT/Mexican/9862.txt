_WtxQbDK7B-ExGdeG-2j6Q We went on a Saturday night a few weeks ago and sat at the bar. Ordered 2 appetizers and drinks for two. The bartender and 2 bar backs were talking the whole time and never paid attention to us or even looked our way so that we could order another round of drinks. The meat on our appetizer was cold and the cheese on top was not melted at all. We finally got the bartender's attention for our check and then he asked if we wanted another drink...um, no thanks. They were not that busy. Paid more attention to a large group of young people over which kind of wine they wanted and they all shared one bottle! We won't be returning...
