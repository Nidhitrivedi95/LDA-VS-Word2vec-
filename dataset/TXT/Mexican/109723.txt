And to further confuse things, the staff refers to everything and everywhere in the restaurant as 'flavortown' - clearly a Guy catch phrase.  You'll also notice that the staff nearly makes a poor Guy impression through your stay, giving that 'hey, I'm cool and relaxed and this place is HIP' vibe - only it's not genuine at all.  How neurotic is Guy that he imposes his personality on the staff?... 

The food is actually quite pleasant! We had two of the Mexican infused burgers and the guac, it was truly great.  I would eat it again and recommend!  The only downside to the food are the chips - they're stale, hard, and flavorless.  If I didn't need a vessel for the delicious guac, I would have avoided them at all costs.

The wait staff was somewhat of a toss up here.  Our waiter was Ok, they were speedy and stayed on top of things.  

However, the management is clueless.  During our entire meal, the general manager and bar manager hosted a vendor (Shane) who was selling a drink infusing gimmick so they could start making Mules at the bar- he was loud, right next to us and we couldn't even hold a conversation.  The bar manager even asked how we were at one point - when we pointed it out she responded with "oh cool, yeah we're trying to make Mules" - hardly the appropriate response to a complaint.  You'd think they would do business deals and host sales events outside of operating hours.  

Overall I would give the food a 4, atmosphere a 2 and the staff a 2.5.  In short - order your food to go.
