pugciBzSCFqa_vn-X5pcEQ Our favorite taco shop we have found since moving from California! The staff is SO nice and the tacos are damn delicious. We get the 5 street tacos for $7.49 I think it was and a chicken quesadilla. They have a lot of different meats to choose from and the barbacoa is my favorite, nice and spicy. They also have little taste tester spoons for you to try the meat before you choose. You can also get whatever you want on your taco for no extra charge (including real guacamole) and their salsas are so good! We have been 3 times in 1 week since finding this gem tucked away in the corner of 75th and Thunderbird.
