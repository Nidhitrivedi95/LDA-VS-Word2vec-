dXoeLzpG72P7F2Lwa01riQ I wish i could give 0 stars but im forced to put one. Worst chipotle ive ever been to. Up the road from my house always try and give it a chance and fails every time. It would be nice to know from the start that they are all out of salad dressing and chips before i order. The chicken in my bowl was burnt, tasted like charcoal and the customer service was terrible.
