jqy0XVyE2KV_hZ32M6Zueg They're always out of something and it's usually guacamole! And there's always a wait on chicken. I'm here now waiting for an order I placed online at 12 noon for a pick up time at 145pm...... and it's not ready! I was told 15-20min. Horrible service and the girl at the register was talking to me like I couldn't understand what she was saying about the online orders and she was rude. The only reason I'm still here waiting is because my boss placed the order and paid for it on her card. I'm going to have to stick to North Olmsted where things are always done right, on time and they're stocked on everything!
