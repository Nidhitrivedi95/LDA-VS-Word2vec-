7m1Oa1VYV98UUuo_6i0EZg I love it here. I love the booze burger. The only thing I would do differently is omit the seasoning from the fries. The seasoning made them almost inedible in my opinion, way too salty. Next time I'm going for the fries plain. I think I may have to eat my way through the menu here!
