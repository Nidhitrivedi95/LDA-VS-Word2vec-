You can get other proteins such as pork or tofu as well.  The service was fine and they even had brewed iced tea (but unfortunately, no lemons).  Some of the chicken was a bit overdone on the outside.  The cucumber peel was a bit thick and could have benefited from being peeled a bit more and they do not give you plates to catch what drops on the table if you are into that but overall it was a nice chance of pace.
