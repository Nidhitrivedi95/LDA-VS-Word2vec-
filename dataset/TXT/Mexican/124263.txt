HpIiNQwjz6ZAFyf96u9WZA Would give less than a star but sometimes its so, so.  Today i tried the triple crunch wrap.  Would have been nice if i had been told it had sour cream on it.  I had to throw it away.  About 3 bites in and i got a mouth full of sour cream and nearly puked.  The commercials dont even mention sour cream.
They need to make sure patrons are informed.  Im so sick now i cant eat anything.
Thanks for making me waste money.
Start doing better.
