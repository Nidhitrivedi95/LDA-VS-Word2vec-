EvDUi_H6-JG3QfGWiInAlw It's all about expectations. I don't understand people that give this place 2 stars because "it's just like Denny's."  Well yes it is, I wasn't expecting French Gourmet.  I like the cosy atmosphere inside a loud and noisy casino. The servers are friendly, but most of the times they are busy. The food is diner standard, and not bad at all. I've tried the Mac & Cheese which is delicious, I like the crusty oven baked tops. I've had the open face roast beef which was good, and so are the burgers and fries. The average price of a meal is between 10 to 15 bucks. I think it's a good value for what you get.
