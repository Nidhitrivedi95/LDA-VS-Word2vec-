Each item is custom made to order, and the toppings are always fresh. The tables & restrooms are always clean, and the staff is super friendly. It's popular for a reason, so don't be surprised if there is a line. But the staff moves quickly & you'll be enjoying your meal before you even notice the wait in line!
