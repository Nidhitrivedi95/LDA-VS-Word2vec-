I came across Mr Leno Mexican Food while looking for another Mexican restaurant, and decided to give it a try based on ratings. Initially, I was just a little taken aback, because there were less than 3 people total dining during the dinner hour. 

Portions were very generous and the food was the average "fast food" Mexican fare. Leno's might not be one of my favorite eating establishments but the food is reasonably priced and as I mentioned the serving sizes are very generous.

Leno's has a  small condiment bar. I really enjoyed the salsa bar with all the different types of salsa's and hot carrots.  The tacos I ordered were  good, however, nothing that stood out. 

Leno's offers a variety of entrées to order from and the customer service is good.  No pretense just come in, order, sit down, and enjoy.
