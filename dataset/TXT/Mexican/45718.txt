7ozeO6N1-fLruVuBcnDKfw After driving by the restaurant many times and thinking "We should stop in and give it a try", we did finally manage to have lunch there today 06/07/11. My husband had the "speedy gonzales", a taco, enchilada, beans & rice, and I had the Taco Salad both were very, very good. I am really glad we stopped.
