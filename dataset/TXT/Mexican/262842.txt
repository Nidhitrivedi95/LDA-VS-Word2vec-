vz8HFGsITt6aj-nyXkAEFg Sorry I went to Dos. The salsa was terrible , chili paste or Las Palmas red chili salsa with nothing added tasted like the spicy one. Regular salsa no flavor and the tomatillo one bland. Chimichanga was a burrito, mushy and brownish sauce, NOT red sauce. Rice was dry and flavorless . I've heard the one in Cave Creek went downhill too. A guest arriving this week and I think I'll skip El Encanto for CC Smokehouse where we are guaranteed great brisket, everything ! It's a shame what you've done to my favorite Mexican Restaurant , sad. If you have to raise the already not cheap prices to hire new chefs, cleaning staff, etc do it. It'd be worth it. I'd rather pay a bit more than eat the sub par food on dirty tables and filthy menus. What have you done?!
