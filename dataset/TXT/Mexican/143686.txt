JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg Saw the solid reviews and figured it was worth checking out. Hostess was friendly and seated us promptly. Nice booths surrounding a U shaped bar. Main issue was service tonight, busboys and water service was solid but strangely waiter was nowhere to be found most of the meal.  When we did see him he was checking in on other tables in the close to empty restaurant. Check in for drinks and to order and didn't come back until after we were done eating. Could have used some tapatio..... luckily bar tender / bar back helped us out in getting check etc. Food was ok and drinks ok, service was the weakest point. 

Pros: average food
Cons: service and paying a premium for average food off strip

Much better Mexican food to be had off strip in the Las Vegas area with better service.
