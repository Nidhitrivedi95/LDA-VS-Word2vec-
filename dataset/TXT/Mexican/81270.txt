d_L-rfS1vT3JMzgCUGtiow I had my wedding reception at border grill Mandalay bay. It was the best I could have ever asked for. The food was out of this world and the guests couldn't stop talking about it. I would defiantly come back here again thank you Karly you where an amazing event manager for our wedding and I loved planning everything with you.
