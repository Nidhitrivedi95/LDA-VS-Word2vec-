Rj-7ymdw8aNZBRqGRAjR3Q I'm a fan solely because of the tableside guacamole and the drinks. I vowed to come only for that after eating here on my birthday one year. 

The entrees were alright, but they were bland. That seriously sums it up. I had the spicy ground beef mexican pizza. Bland. No spice. Not even any beef flavor. I sampled someone else's chicken fajitas. Bland. Carne Asada tacos? You guessed it, bland! It was almost like they ran out of salt, pepper, and all other herbs and spices in the kitchen that night. The tortilla on the mexican pizza was dry and the top layer flaked away completely, leaving only the middle layer stuck to everything else. The only reason I stated that the food was alright and not terrible was because it was all cooked well (minus the tortilla on the mexican pizza, it was like licking the arm of the guy from Tales from the Crypt...)

Back to the tableside guacamole, it's fresh, smooth, and citrus-y. I loved it so much that I started making it at home occasionally. The head chef posted his recipe in VegasSeven Magazine one year and I've been hooked. The sangria and cocktails just bring the whole experience together.

Like RA sushi, this place is LOUD! Don't come for conversation with a date or long lost relatives...come to eat and drink and look at their pretty faces while listening to music being hammered out overhead. Otherwise, you'll spend the night incorrectly lip reading instead.
