phIL-dJoT8uztbdFgfk_3w We went to Fat Bastard Burrito in Liberty Village for a late lunch today.

Gord got their feature ... a big chicken bacon burrito and he said it was good.

I hadn't had breakfast and was starving so ordered a huge chicken burrito, figuring I would take what I couldn't eat home.  Well, I ate the whole thing ... and it was delicious!
