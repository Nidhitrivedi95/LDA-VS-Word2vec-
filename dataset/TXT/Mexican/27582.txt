3I7xY7DjWearTz7d4TGdbw Happy Hour is THE BEST!  I went here with a meetup group this week.  We were seated in the restaurant because there were 20 of us.  They told us, however, that they would honor the Happy Hour prices until 6 pm which they did.  Those that ordered from the HH menu got huge meals at very reasonable prices.  I saw street tacos (3 tacos per plate) with rice and refried beans and another order of a HUGE nacho platter.  Margaritas and sangria were ordered by several ladies--again at the HH price.

I ordered off of the menu and got a Machaca Tostada with pinto beans and guacamole.  I took half of it home because it was so big.  It was also delicious.

The service was great--we had one waitress for 20 of us.  She was patient and handled us with efficiency.  I was impressed!  Will definitely go back.
