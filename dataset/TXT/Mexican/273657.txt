x-tXcUgPjaP9Q0lYMBKZnQ How do you forget the quesadilla in the kids meal? These kids obviously can't remember something as basic as 3-4 items in an order. Bad work ethic and service. Thank god they just work at a Chipotle and not at any higher level job because they'd prolly be terrible at that too.
