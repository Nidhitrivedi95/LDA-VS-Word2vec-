DYnFGGYU3SkrKT_G4djpYQ Don't order the vegetarian quesadilla here. Just a tortilla with cheese and lettuce. I would have been happy with Taco Bell quesadilla and packaged sauce instead of this. I was surely disappointed by my decision to eat here. I had ordered that day's special dish (very cheap). I was not very hungry. I would not recommend this place to anyone (or anyone vegetarian).
