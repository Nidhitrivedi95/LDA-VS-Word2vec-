ovApUucCKSb9k0lTP2JieQ So I got here a bit before 9am and saw the hours sign that says it opens at 10 on Monday and thought damnit. While looking up other places, someone came out to tell me it actually is open. So...? Not sure what to trust.

I have to agree with Alex who doesn't understand the hype. There was plenty of food but it all felt cheap and not worth making the trek. Refried beans that look and taste like generic canned beans. Mexican rice that I could've done better at home with tomato chicken bouillon.
