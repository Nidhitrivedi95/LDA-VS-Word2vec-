YYE0C8FeDpB6zqB0kSEh7w I seldom write reviews but I after my experience at Chile Addiction, I wanted to make sure that I sang as much of their praises as possible.  I discovered this location based on a referral from a friend who knows I'm a fan of spicy food.  Being from the East Coast, I had yet to try the flavors of New Mexican food.  From the moment I entered this family owned/operated establishment, I knew I had found one of my new favorite local restaurants.  I fell in love with the green chile chicken soup and have been back numerous times since then.  I'm definitely a fan of the stacked enchiladas.  The most wonderful part about this establishment is the spice from the chile!  I have recommended Chile Addiction to numerous friends who have also had positive experiences.  I'm looking forward to them serving alcohol soon as I feel it will only enhance the experience.    

A great find and I'm excited to come back.
