gIPrEKqnJwaAH0ZyvnQHeg I went there on 6/23/16 and ordered a shredded beef burrito. I chomped down hard on something metal, it was like a nail or something like that . I complained and they offered a new meal, but I was so disgusted that was in my food- I was not interested in eating anything else. Found out a little later that my tooth chipped- going tomorrow to dentist for that. How does a piece of metal get into food? I hope they investigated so it won't happen again to anyone else. I opted not to file a complaint because I only realized the chipped tooth later, was already stressed over another situation not related.
