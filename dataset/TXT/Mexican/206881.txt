Q4AWWdBWe_ojYX1a4ffXFQ This is probably my last trip here. We stopped because yelp said they are one of the best restaurants in the US. Authentic Mexican cuisine. My wife (Mexican) got some tacos and I got the carne asada burrito. My wife said that the tacos where ok that she had better. Now my burrito when I got it it was cut in half and I can see inside it. It was full of white rice. Only had a little meat. I payed $10 the a rice burrito lol. Come on when you think of authentic Mexican food you think of a burrito full of meat, beans, tomatoes, cilantro, avocados and flavors! If I wanted a sushi burrito I would of gone to a sushi bar. If you want good tacos go to DJ tacos or somewhere else down the street. You will thank me.
