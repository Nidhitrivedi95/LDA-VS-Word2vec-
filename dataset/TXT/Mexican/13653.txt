0odAupWjDV8gwhaLqyh1-A We walked in on Sunday, Aug. 6th at 7:30 pm, half an hour before they closed. There were about 3 tables taken and when we got in, we were the only ones in line. The young African American woman working the counter acted as if she couldn't be bothered. No "Hello" or anything. I get it, it's the end of the day and she's tired. Whatever. 

I love Chipotle and we go to a lot of different locations and we always seem to get huge portions. I know this is located at an outlet mall so they need to be a bit stingier than stand alone Chipotle but they are almost closing. We got one scoop of brown rice, less than what we normally get, and when we asked for corn, I swear we each got less than 15 kernels on our bowl and there were a lot left. What is she saving it for? Rice and corn are not that expensive! She gave us very little of everything else. Normally, I'm so full by the time I finished my chicken bowl but this time, all three of us were still quite hungry when we got to our resort. I'm so glad I know not to come back to this location. They give such small portions!
