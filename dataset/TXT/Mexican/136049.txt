iOt7ebp4Zy-5YUjHL1rbmQ Literally the best news I got last week was learning the new location of backyard taco opened up in Gilbert. Backyard has essentially five different flavors in my view. They package these different flavors in a few different ways, tacos, quesadillas, etc, which may sound a little boring. But I assure you those 5 flavors are outstanding... just exceptional. So for instance the steak taco and the steak quesadilla are very close in taste...  but wow, both are very very good.  I love to get a bean and cheese burrito and steak quesadilla... it's the best.
