iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg This is the first place I've given 5 stars. I tried 4 of their tacos and loved each one of them. The blackened mahi mahi, baja, grilled octopus and catfish tacos were all amazing. They each had different toppings which went well with the different styles of filling. 

They had some awesome habanero sauce too. Def gave the tacos some extra kick!!
