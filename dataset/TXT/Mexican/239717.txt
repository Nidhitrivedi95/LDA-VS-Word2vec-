T2tEMLpTeSMxLKpxwFdS3g Cabo Fish Taco is one of those places that people who don't frequent the NoDa area tend to flock to. 

Being right in the middle of NoDa, Cabo Fish Taco tries to embrace the NoDa vibes with some quirky artwork, but just misses the mark a bit.

My stomach has never agreed with Cabo based on the three times I've eaten tacos there (not a great sign). I also just can't get over the fact that every time I've gone, THE CHIPS HAVE BEEN STALE. This is mind-boggling to me, since they serve so many chips every day. I will admit, the spicy avocado salad is a REALLY solid pasta salad, so definitely snag that as a side if you're dining there!
