IJGrBQyYpCBkbZx65H5J5g One of my favorite go-to places. I haven't had a bad experience since going here. It's tasty and also affordable. Staff is friendly and love the ambience of the place. 

Also, if you're looking for a place to go to on Taco Tuesday, their original fish tacos are $1.75 if you come after 2:30pm. Very good as well.
