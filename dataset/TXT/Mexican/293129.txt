ywF14Amq9SLX5o8Qnx3hgA Went here based on some positive Yelp reviews on their supposed good menudo.  Sadly the menudo was subpar and lacked flavor.  However the service was good and the homemade tortillas were excellent.  So far Pepe's Tacos on Decatur blvd has provided the best menudo in Las Vegas.
