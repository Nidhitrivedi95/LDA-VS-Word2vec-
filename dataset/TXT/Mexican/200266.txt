pDewiJY6KCcZgLxxgxg13Q This is the my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. I started going here at a previous job based on coworkers' recommendations, and quickly fell in love with this gem.

When you enter it's like being culturally transported to central Mexico. 

The servers are fast and attentive, and there are always specials and new items. Prices are totally fair, too.

I enjoy that you get a cup of soup with every meal, and the soup itself varies by day. I always get the enchiladas or a tostada - both are great.

You'll definitely have leftovers - and if you go here during the workday, don't plan on being super productive after eating here, you'll head to food coma alley rapidly.

For authentic, delicious food this is the place to be. Note - I think they're closed Mondays.
