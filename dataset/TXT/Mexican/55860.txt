Staff messed up our order (brought us someone else's order) then told us they couldn't exchange it.  The server called the manager and the manager told him it would come out of their paycheck (these words between staff were exchanged in an area full of customers).  When our food (our correct order came) it was cold and and they replaced the limes with lemons.  We asked for limes and were told "no" because they (the servers) had been instructed to only use lemons since limes were more expensive.  
Also, they then ran my card twice on the same transaction and when I called to have it corrected they accused me of coming in twice on the same day, not the case.  

Overall, just plain awful or maybe it was just my luck.
