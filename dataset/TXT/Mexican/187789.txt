O2opXFPnTG-Pxa_u-3w66A Pros: The tacos were good, and they brought cheese sauce with the chips and salsa. Cons: the mole was the worst I've ever had. It took forever to get our food. They never came back for refills, and when we were clearly ready to leave, we had to wait a good 20 minutes for our check. Won't be back.
