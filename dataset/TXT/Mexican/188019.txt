o5Mofj5KJkYAMs_fhxftpg Are you craving Korean or Mexican food? If the answer is yes, Seoul taco it is.

The menu is simple. I ordered the bulgogi quesadilla and a spicy pork taco. The taco was delicious, a good mix of meat and lettuce. The quesadilla was very meh. The quesadilla was not held together by the cheese, quite unusual. There was a thin layer of cheese with meat and lettuce on top. Quesadilla fell apart very easily and was super messy to eat.

Side note: when I was paying, the cashier coughed into his hands and handled my credit card. I'm not a germsphobe, but please teach your employees how to cough into their sleeves. (3 stars for this reason)

Overall I think the tacos are good, but not sure about other items.
