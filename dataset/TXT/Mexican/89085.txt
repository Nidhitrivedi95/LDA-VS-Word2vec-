dOkrbSdJ3FxXhGqdOHgL9A Walked in & short blond waitress told us to seat ourselves. Unfortunately every table was either occupied or full of dirty dishes from the previous customer. We then stood awkwardly in the dining area hoping to get noticed in vain. At that point we decided to clear dishes off of the table so we could sit down. The waitress came by several minutes later and took our drink order. We did not see the waitress again for another 15 minutes and when we finally did, we had to aggressively beckon her over to place a food order. Additionally, 3/4 of the hot sauce bottle assortments were either expired or crusted over with old sauce. My friends and I did not use these hot sauce bottles as they were quite disgusting. It would have been much easier to stay home cook tacos and drink my own beer. No plans for a future visit.
