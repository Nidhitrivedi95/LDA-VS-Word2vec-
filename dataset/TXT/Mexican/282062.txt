XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg This was my second visit to Mesa Grill. First let me start by saying that we are grilling fools. We grill all year round and have enjoyed Bobby's grilling book as well as Food Network shows. 

The decor is warm and open. The bartender was great and our waitress Tiffany was awesome and attentive. Some of the best service I have ever experienced. This is including the bus boy.

We started with the Prawn Tamale appetizer which was cooked to perfection. The masa corn mix was perfectly flavored.

I ordered the 15 spice chicken with mango salsa. This was tender and a large portion. My sides were mashed potatoes and the blue cheese corn side which was so so so delicious.

I had a view of the kitchen, it was hard for me to tell how the dishes are transfered from the kitchen to the wait staff, it looked confusing to me. Last time we were here something happened and while I was served my pork loin dish after 20 minutes and my hubby was served his steak dish which turned cold. Its almost as if another waiter took my dish for another table at the time and his dish sat awhile. 

They handled the situation well at the time. This is why I waited for my second visit to review it, I love the food.
