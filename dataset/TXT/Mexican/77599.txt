cKgUCzMGuRgkbKXUsgeXUw Our hotel suggested that we visit the Barrio Queen, Scottsdale for Mexican food. There were 3 in our party. The service was good. The food was good the margaritas were not so good. My wife sent hers back because it had a strange taste. Her second margarita was a bit better but did not taste much better than the first. We were not charged for her drinks. My margarita was very sour but I did finish it. If we return to Scottsdale and we are looking for a truly good Mexican restaurant we will not return to the Barrio Queen.
