gwd1W_0Mgzqo3QxgXrt16Q The food wasn't bad. The cocktail I got ("You're Killing Me Smalls") was really good and well worth the $10. The queso dip with the chorizo was really good too (they don't do complimentary chips and salsa here) I had a shrimp taco, a fried oyster taco and a Korean steak taco...all of which weren't bad....but after having the Korean BBQ pork taco from Pinky's last night for half the price, I probably would've traded that last one. 

Also coming off the heels of Pinky's, the service was pretty subpar here. The hostess wasn't particularly friendly. Our waitress (Katie) was somewhat attentive at first and then after we got our food (which someone else brought), she checked on us once and then completely disappeared for about 30 minutes...I sat with an empty water glass for the better part of my meal...and we we sat at our table for like 15 minutes after we finished , waiting for our check. 

Somehow our check was about $65 for two people and it didn't feel like anything out of the ordinary. Bottom line, if I came here again it would probably just be to have a specialty cocktail and an appetizer.
