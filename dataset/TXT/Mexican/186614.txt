Nz44ccUso3nq5S2OlQHNlA My family tried Mexican food for the first time. The owners were very accommodating and informative about different kinds of meats available. 

I tried steak burrito large and the size of the burrito was pretty big. The tortilla wrap was tight and it didn't fall apart. The meat was very tasty and all the ingredients were mixed together very well and none stood out of place. 

Definitely recommending it for anyone who's up for Mexican food in Scarborough area.
