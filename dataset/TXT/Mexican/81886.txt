d_L-rfS1vT3JMzgCUGtiow Good, but not great.  I was disappointed in the ambiance - inside, you're convention-side, drawing conventioneers - what more can be said about that? Even conventioneers don't want to be conventioneers, right?
Outside, you are overlooking the backside of the Mandalay wave pool and the lazy river. It felt a little Disney-esque to me.  

The food - it was very good, fresh and well done, but nothing will rock yor world. ....at all. I was expecting more interesting options. I'd read reviews saying it was not a burrito, quesadilla type menu - but it WAS. Maybe they've had to dumb it down to accommodate the masses? Sad, very sad.

The margarita's were too sweet. The waitress couldn't offer up any alternatives? That's sad too.

Bottom line - NOT a destination, but just fine if you are there already.
