TcCWYYL6FxBTT6KrxabwRg Right in the heart of the Saturday afternoon market on the Strip, Edgar's and the competing taco stand just around the corner contribute to one of the best smelling street corners ever, with sweet and earthy tendrils of corn tortillas wafting by and hints of the various meats cooking on their griddles.

With some of our brunch targets packed to the gills on a beautiful Saturday afternoon, my girlfriend and I switched to snacking at the various food stands on the Strip, with Edgar's being the main stop. I went with a chicken and lamb barbacoa tacos and their watermelon agua fresca to drink. The lamb was lightly topped while the chicken was more generously topped, while you're left ot finish it off with the salsa of your choice, and I just went with what looked like salsa verde.

Sitting down at one of the handful of tables next to their stand, we dug right in. The lamb was tender and flavourful, and the sauce it was in kept it from getting too dry. There was a little bit of spice to the guac and a nice fresh pop from the pico and all of that was evened out by the queso fresco. The chicken had a mild flavour, but it was tender and moist, and topped equally as well as the lamb.

The watermelon agua fresca was fantastic. It tasted simply of watermelon with very little, if any, extra sweetening, just letting the fruit stand on its own.

Edgar's was an excellent spot in a equally great little area. Hit this place up if you're in the Strip.
