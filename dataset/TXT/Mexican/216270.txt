R54Sh5Y3zjtZt7MjdfwDZA I've been to other Rubios before and the food is always consistent. But besides the food this location also has a great staff. All of the girls there, especially Vivian, are all friendly and knowledgeable about the food. I go there at least once a week and have never been disappointed. 

BTW, the Maui Maui burrito is my regular order. Great taste. Very fresh and quite filling.
