EjzMHfwqAmj7BgdzQjquRQ Came here for drinks and something small to eat since it was close by. Brand new and only open for 20 days. The interior was nicely decorated and had a very nice ambience. It is a little pricier than other Mexican restaurants and menu items are pretty typical. The tamale plate was ok kinda tasted like store bought tamales you could probably get at Cardenas. The guacamole was good tasted fresh and chunky which is how I like it. The chips and salsa was nothing special. The Chango Wango cocktail was filled with way too much alcohol I didn't even finish it. The barbacoa michelda was interesting. Tasted liked a typical michelda with a saltier taste and it was topped with pieces of barbacoa which was pretty good actually. Probably won't be back here.
