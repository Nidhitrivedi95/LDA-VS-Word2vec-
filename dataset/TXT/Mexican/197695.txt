OzcvQqt_copeLRCT2OHrfA Originally I really liked this place. I was so excited to find a Mexican place that wasn't taco bell or robertos for lack of a better comparison. I loved the fresh tortillas and just the overall flavor of their plates. The first time I went, I was with my boyfriend. I got the chorizo plate and he got the carnitas plate. We went home to eat and about 1/4 of the way through his food, he found a hair. He immediately threw his food away and we called to inform them. We aren't the kind of people that call to get free shit. We just want to let whoever is in charge know that they need to keep an eye on their chef. She started trying to almost defend it? Saying things like "oh he's human. we wear hair nets. Hair in food isn't our thing" like yeah we get it, but fix the problem. She ended up comping him a meal which he picked up at a later date. We went back because everyone deserves second chances. We had gone there 2 more times. Then 2 days ago he went and good food, and behold, another hair. Now we double checked this time that it wasn't mine or his. My hair is long and his is very very short. This was a shorter but not super short, black hair. Unfortunately, with this being the second time, as much as we enjoyed the food, we will not be returning.
