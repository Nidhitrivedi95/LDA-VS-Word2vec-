4H7Olit19_wdu14hJI-tiw Came Here for the first time as I saw it had a five star review and it lived up to the review, i live in Chandler which is an hour drive from me but well worth the trip. I had the filet fish stuffed with shrimp and crab only over crema of chipotle sauce. I live in Chandler and I would drive out of my way again, the tostadas de ceviche were just average though.
