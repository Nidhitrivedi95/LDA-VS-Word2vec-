2pWFsnqMlYSPFGUF4Vv38Q Very mediocre food. Crispy Taco was made with a prefab shell and the shell was rubbery instead of crispy. Enchilada was okay but sauce lacked flavor and red sauce wasn't very red.Beans and rice ok but weren't broiled bubbling hot with lots of cheese as I prefer. Overall very "fast foodish". Won't be returning. Did have a nice atmosphere.
