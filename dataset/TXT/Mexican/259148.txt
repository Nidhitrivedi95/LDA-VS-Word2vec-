VO-p1uczeMbzH8bEAv-RgA This was a stopover on our way to Texas, I wanted to eat Mexican food so I yelped this place, it's really good except, my fajita words not sizzling hot like I'm used to, and being from Los Angeles, expected homemade corn tortillas, The chicken had a good flavor and the salsa was OK, again being from Los Angeles we expect get a hot salsa, but if I was in Arizona again I would probably stop as it was tasty next time I will try a michelida. You would got 5 stars if you had homemade tortillas.
