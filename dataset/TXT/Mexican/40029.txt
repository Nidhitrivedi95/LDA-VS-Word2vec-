6ockUmdOBYBApEsUCJkBzA I feel compelled to write a review for El Oasis because it's so freakin amazing, but part of me is hesitant because I want it to be a secret place of deliciousness for myself. Mine only.
This place, though, is insanely good. I am Hispanic and grew up in Chicago where there are many, many paleterias to chose from--and oh boy, did I. Guava, pistachio, avocado, tamarind, water-based, milk-based..I grew up with all these flavors and options, and this place STILL surprised ma taste buds. 
I went in and bought a pecan and caramel popsicle. I hadn't even reached the car when I turned around to buy five more and get them to go! Mine tasted like legit pecans, and had unfrozen caramel filling in the inside. How?? Magic.
