1HfkEkNhI6XJXkgrCTBKpw My wife and I recently had a very enjoyable mid-week lunch at the Urban Tavern.  It has a neat atmosphere when all of its front windows are open to the street on a summer's day.  We each had a beer and a sandwich (which comes with a nice variety of sides to choose from).  Both the prices and the portions were very good.  Our server did a nice job when he was waiting on us, but seemed to disappear for extended periods of time.  This didn't bother us (as we were on vacation and taking our time), but if we were in a rush, it could have been frustrating.
