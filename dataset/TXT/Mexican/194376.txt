OsuBqr2L0-5W8LGAsg-p8g Ahh! Had my 1st ever Sonoran hot dog today and it was really good,service was A-1.I believe the owners of the place served us,very friendly and accommodating for the dog,I sat down inside at a table looked at the dog,Yup thats a Sonoran dog alright,then I took my first bite,oh boy thats good!  lots of different flavors going on and they were all good,then I eyed the roasted pepper that came with the dog I stripped off the meaty parts and placed the pepper on the dog and took another bite,it was heaven! not terribly hot but very flavorful and the bun was the best I've ever encountered,I'll be trying the famous Sonoran dogs of Tucson in the near future I just hope they are as good as Mickeys
