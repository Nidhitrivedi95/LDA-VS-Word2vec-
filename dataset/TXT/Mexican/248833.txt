uCDVOidGLpD-Q7_y82nx2g Walked into this place by chance after finding Banjara closed due to a maintenance issue.  We were pleasantly surprised at how successful this random selection was.  

We ordered the nacho-quesadilla-jalapeno popper platter for an appetizer, all three of which were winners (especially the jalapeno poppers!  You'll need a spice neutralizer on hand for those).

We also had the chicken tacos, as well as the chorizo tacos. We both favored the chorizo tacos, but the chicken wasn't without it's charm.  Sadly, no fish tacos were on the menu.  

All in all, everything was yummy; the guac, the salsa verde, and the corn tortillas were all tops.
