VRTrhsYKSJo1kGX5RqBlFA My boyfriend and I went in for dinner on Halloween around 9pm. The place didn't seem too busy we were two of the four people at the whole bar. The bartender barely wanted to service us as we sat down and was super rude like we were inconveniencing him. We finally flagged down someone to help take our order at the bar since we couldn't get help from him and she was even worst! She asked who our server was and then end up taking our order rushing us like the place was busy. 

*shaking my head*

Horrible customer service! Plenty of other taco restaurant around town!!!
