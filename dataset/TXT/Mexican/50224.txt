8USUyIeN39rurnqCn5cA0w Couldn't decide whether to have the tortilla soup or the chicken soup so they combined them. Good soup, large pieces of chicken, etc.  The bowl is a very large serving.  Chips and salsa were great.  Server was friendly and helpful. Will definitely return.  Piks attached, one before the cheese melted, one after.
