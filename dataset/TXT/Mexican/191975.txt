oi6txZ8-Hj8BU4Dsk4hn5g I just wanted to say I have been going here for 7 yrs they remember you the Costa Bravo soup is amazing!! They are so nice!! I literally crave and look forward to planning when I can visit. I find myself after a long stretch at work talking to co workers telling them tomorrow I am having my soup and relaxing! Love live love this place authentic good and welcoming always:)
