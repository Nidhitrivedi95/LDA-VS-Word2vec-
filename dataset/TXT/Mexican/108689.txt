frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A BOMB! LIFE CHANGING! DELICIOUS! A lot of my visits to restaurants happen just by chance. I googled, "Restaurants near me" as my husband and I were driving up 7th St. This came up and I thought the name was interesting so we decided to give it a try. MAN! This was a good pick! 
The food was so delicious and freshly made. They had a salsa bar with many different salsas. All were delicious and none too spicy. I should knock it off a star because the service was not great (they were slow, but it was because they are busy)  but I can't because their food was that great. I got the 3 taco combo with rice and beans (1 taco barbacoa and 2 shrimp), my son a traditional quesadilla, and my husband the Mazatlan burrito with shrimp. All of it was amazing! The beans were not out of a can, the rice was do tasty and...man! Honestly, greatness! 
We are from out of state and I joked with my husband about coming back before heading back home, but honestly, I was not joking. I would definitely go there again, and again, and again, whenever I see my way back to AZ.
