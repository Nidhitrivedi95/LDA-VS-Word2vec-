BIbjBxoiJLS8CnNsSP64TQ My short flight was delayed for a couple hours.  Obviously airport food is expensive and portions are tiny.  But with all of the great food choices in Las Vegas, I expected something better near the Southwest Airlines gates.

360 Gourmet Burrito would seem to be modeled as a low-class Chipotle.  Obviously minimal investment in quality and presentation.  I ordered a grilled chicken burrito.  I threw it away after four bites, but that was half-a-burrito too late!  I already had my worst indigestion decades -- It lasted about one hour per bite.

I'd suggest that you try one of the other places, but the best choice is to bring your own sandwich.  Or take advantage of the situation to start a half-day dietary fast.  Or buy a bag of tortilla chips at the news stand.  Or ask the Southwest flight attendant for an extra bag of peanuts.
