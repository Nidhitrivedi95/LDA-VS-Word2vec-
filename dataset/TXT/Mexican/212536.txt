qRUEQowj9yuV-HFwm9wZXw I was so hoping for a great experience. The food was very good, but there are three un-cleaned tables and no one is making an effort to clean them. I ordered a margarita and it came in a water glass. It was so small that I should have ordered a beer because there is more in a  Coors Light bottle than what I got in my on the rocks margarita. We ordered a salad as an appetizer and it showed up with dinner. The salad was the chopped lettuce they use in taco and not regular hand leaf lettuce. Regardless, the veggie burrito they made me was awesome and really good. Was so wanting this to be better. FYI - the margarita ended up being $5.00 for about 8oz of drink.
