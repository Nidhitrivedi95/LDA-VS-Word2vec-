kXl44keW3wZaJpjEqHk30g Tonight I ordered a cheeseburger meal with fruit and a side of zucchini sticks.  The first thing that was wrong with my order was they put my cheeseburger and fruit in the same container with the cheeseburger on top of the fruit. This made the fruit warm and made it taste like the cheeseburger (very disgusting). Then I took a bite of the cheeseburger and it was pink. I broke the cheeseburger in half to see if it was pink throughout and it was.  I am very disappointed in this location.
