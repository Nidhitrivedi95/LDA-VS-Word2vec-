There were so many people at this taco shop which I knew meant they were going to be amazing. So amazing that people were becoming confrontational when people broke in line. Should be some order and organization there. You run up to a vacant countertop space and scream your order to the staff behind a sneeze guard in the kitchen. Then once you retrieve your food, you run over to get in line for the cashier. And this line intersects with the crowd who is pushing and shoving to place their food orders. Anyways, great food, just be prepared.
