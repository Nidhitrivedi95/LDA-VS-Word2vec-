Prices are extremely reasonable, so make sure to go when you're good and hungry because you'll be able to get a lot for just a few books. The Special Combination is about $10 but comes with enough food for three people. I also really like getting just a plain bean burrito. At $3.50, it's a great lunch choice.

Chips and salsa come free with your meal and are usually pretty good. The salsa is sometimes a bit inconsistent, but that's what happens when a restaurant serves freshly made salsa. I'll take fresh over consistent any day.
