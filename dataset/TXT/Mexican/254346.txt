v7xjDbezQ2xw95itvN244Q This place is okay... Definitely horrible service. We walked in & seated ourselves. Took about 10 minutes to get acknowledged by the waitress, then about another 10 minutes to get the drinks. Finally she took our order and the food was out in a reasonable amount of time. 

We ordered the shrimp cocktail & the aguachiles. The aguachiles was good, however this place is pretty expensive. I'm not sure what the market prices are for shrimp, but this place is no bargain. 

I will say their preparadas (beer with a combination of some shrimp juice) were 5 stars. Really tasty. 

Perhaps I'll return, but if I don't it won't be the end of the world.
