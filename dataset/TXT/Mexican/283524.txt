XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Finishing up a business trip we went to Mesa Grill as this is on our list of must try places. 

We ended up getting just appetizers, which watching other people seems everybody that was there did. 

We got the Tiger Shrimp Tamale - Simply amazing. I know everyone says that, but it really was. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, which is a rarity. I don't know what else to say.

Second we got the Pancake with duck, which also comes so highly recommended. It too was delicious, we ranked it second behind the Tamale, but was still amazing. 

Third, we got the stuffed squash blossoms. Really good, not something I would normally order, and indeed it ranked 3rd of the three.

Overall, the food we enjoyed was incredible... but $60 for 3 small appetizers, we probably would not go back just due to budgetary constraints.
