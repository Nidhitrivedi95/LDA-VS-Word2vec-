EP1do6l8hLyIGEru0gN3EQ Went here around 2pm on a Friday afternoon. I had a taste for Mexican, and we were both craving their jalapeno margaritas, so my boyfriend drove by Barrio in Tremont, but they were closed until four (I believe). So instead I suggested Johnny Mango's, as my sister always raves about it and I was in the mood to try someplace new. 

The service was friendly and super laid back, which I don't mind.
 
I was instantly impressed with the selection of fresh-squeezed juices, so I got a Kale-Aid and slurped it right down like a happy kid. My boyfriend was surprised to find that they, too, had a jalapeno margarita similar to Barrio's. He had two, and was also content drink wise. However, Barrio's is spicier. Bordering in between hot and too hot. This one was mild. Someone who prefers milder spice levels may prefer the margarita at Johnny Mango's. I prefer the salty-sweet heat of Barrio's. 

As for the food, I got the big plate with a chorizo-potato stuffed burrito, and my boyfriend got the big plate with a steak quesadilla. It came with beans, rice, a tangy/crunchy slaw, and a fried banana. I've never enjoyed a banana so much in my life. I will say that the quantity of meat in my burrito was sparse, and a lot of the reviews on the burrito are quite accurate (some said it seemed like it was more like a wrap, and some said it wasn't "filled" like a traditional idea of a burrito). My boyfriend's quesadilla was much more delicious. I won't get the burrito next time, but I'll definitely be back to try something new. 

If I had any complaints, I will say that it's slightly overpriced for me, personally. At roughly 11 bucks for my plate, I wouldn't make a habit of going there as I would for example, Chipotle, for 7 bucks.
