UoRSHohdGuzfrpydZ9j0Lg For years, we have heard nothing but good things about this location. I once had a terrifying experience at their Hudson location but that is a review previously listed.

Upon giving in to try this place, we are very disappointed. For starters, the service is sub par. I mentioned my food allergy and she almost ignored it with a "mhm" and didn't bother to write it down nor tell the kitchen I'm sure.

The only item worth getting here is the queso, but I still wouldn't bother. We had the enchiladas. All you could taste is the flour tortilla and the pasta sauce they clearly smothered it in. A handful of plain beef and we had what looked like mexican food and tasted like Italian junk. The margaritas were from a slushie machines and taste like something you buy at cedar point.  THEY ALSO CHARGE YOU 50 CENTS FOR A CUP OF CHIPS. 

And they shoved me in the corner like Baby.

All and all, I won't come here again.
