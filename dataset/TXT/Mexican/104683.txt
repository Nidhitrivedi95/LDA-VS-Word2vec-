fGnILhhgE393e-8X9JIB4Q I must say for the location the food is fantastic. It's authentic and true to what Mexican home cooking should taste like. 
That being said, I find the prices high for few reasons
You're in a strip mall around Vaughan Mills. I know your rent isn't high
You require guests to get their own salsa. Sure it's an experience but I have to get up midst my meal just to get sauce. Why am I at a sit down?
App, 2 mains, 1 dessert and 1margarita cost $70? That doesn't include tip.... Again steep in my opinion..

So in short if the pricing was more reasonable of
I'd go here more. But given what we paid for 2 adult dinners I'd rather go downtown with better ambience and view....

Food is good though.. Just pricey for what you get.
