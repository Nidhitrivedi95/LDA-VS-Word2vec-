OA5Li3ySzhrbG_WvD_QGYA Had been wanting to go here for awhile for their happy hour and finally made it and we were not disappointed!  Our waitress was fantastic!  She had great recommendations and was very friendly.  Our margaritas were sooo good...try the blueberry! The chips and salsa were also good, nice amount of spice to the salsa.  And the tacos we came up with were delicious!  I like that you can make up your own and experiement.
