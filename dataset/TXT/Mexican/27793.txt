3IwCop28R1_L5jMv6AkL8Q Everything I have had here is awesome. Nachos with carnitas and the mushroom quesadilla are both amazing. the bacon wrapped shrimp is SO good. I just had the chicken and bacon burrito and it is incredible. The dishes are mild but they have sauces on the table to spice things up if you care to. I like everything they serve as is.
