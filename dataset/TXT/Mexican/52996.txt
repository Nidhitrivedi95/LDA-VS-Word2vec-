Kids menu with crayons and activities. Servers were quick and attentive. The chips and queso dip made a quick & delicious starter for the group. Plenty of salsa, salsa verde, and hot sauce on the table to go around. I had the Milanesa sandwich and it was everything I could ever dream of. Crispy, but still juicy, chicken on ciabatta with arugula, black beans, and an avocado lemon mayo. It also came with a side of salsa verde which made a great dip for the sandwich, but is just as delicious without. Family enjoyed the tacos as well. Kids liked their fun-sized cheese quesadillas. This was my first time at Bakersfield and has already become a favorite. Park for free in the Public Parking Lot by the West Side Market just a two minute walk to this fun, delicious joint.
