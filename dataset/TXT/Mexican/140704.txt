Ja4stXdNYr39u5CZHMNtjw Im no longer a big fan of getting Mexican food since my mom makes the best, and every restaurant is just second best to her. I found this place and made reservations online, since one sister wanted Mexican and the other sister that came along loves tequila I figured it was already a homerun. 

Walking in its a very cool little joint. Very colorful and vibrant which I liked, and super clean. We got seated right away and I ordered a Guacamole and our drinks to get us going while we figured out what we wanted. They brought out salsa and the guacamole and chips. I love Salsas and as long as you don't try to get too nuts you can make some of the best just with a few ingredients. Unfortunately, these 2 salsa mild and hot were neither hot nor good... They were very sweet and yugh! The Guacamole was very bland. I feel like they just mashed Avocado with some pomegranate drizzled on top, it needed some lime, cilantro, some salt.. You know the basics! 

We got our tacos and yes!!! They were actually pretty damn good. I got 2 shredded beef and 2 carne asad and they were delightful. We asked if they had some salsa in the back that was HOT (which most Mexican restaurants do). They did bring some out and with the chips it was pretty weird tasting, but inside the tacos it was delish! It was super spicy just like I love it. 

Last thing that surprised me was the Bill... I have never been charged for salsa... Like ever....... This place charges $1.50 for a small cup of Hot Hot salsa, and we had 2 of them. Its not that I cannot afford 3 dollars its just seriously.... $1.50 Each Salsa!!! I was just surprised by this. I would have gotten it anyway if they would have told me up front its just more that I have never been asked to pay for the chip salsa.... At least it made out Tacos complete.
