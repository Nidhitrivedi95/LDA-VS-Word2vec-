We started out with the Lobster Deviled eggs, which were light and tast. The bacon on the eggs were a great touch. Our main course: the Southwest Poki Bowl, very fresh with an interesting twist of southwestern veggies and spices. My wife had the Baja Enchilada Stack, which was seasoned well and very tasty. These were two completely different taste profiles, which was nice to have. We also took home the Roasted Poblano and Jalapeno Cream Soup, which tasted great the next day. Prices were moderate, the atmosphere was pleasant and the staff was friendly. Great job!
