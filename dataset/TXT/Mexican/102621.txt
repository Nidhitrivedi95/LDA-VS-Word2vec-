F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw Without a doubt, the best meal, staff and atmosphere in all of our travels.  It may be small but it packs a lot into it!!  We used to have Emeril's NOLA restaurant as the top of our list, but it has been replaced!!  We started with the guacamole and margarita samplers, then crispy confit pig tails (outstanding), the wife had the pork chop which was better than any pork chop we've had!! I had the braised short rib tamales which were the best tamales ever!!!!  We sat at the chef's table which put our meal time at about 2 1/2 hours but it was so worth it.  Definetly going back, maybe try a regular table this time.  Get reservations, you'll need them!!!
