I3STZd5iAvUL9MNLF_DUug Let me start by saying that when I walked up to be seated I should have turned around then. I am in no way saying this place is bad. It is not, but it is not my kind of place. I look for a place with the "Cheers" vibe. Friendly, easy going, laid back, & fun. This is more of a here to be seen place. True food was good. Everyone is super nice and if your into this kind of place it would probably be a 5 star for you.
