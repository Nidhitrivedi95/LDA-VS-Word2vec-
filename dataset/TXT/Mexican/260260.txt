vQq_sX0kSAUdT3yLW06q5A I came here at 3pm to meet with a client on a Friday - NOBODY was here!  I had to ask if they were open (they were).  Food was decent, had a salad with grilled chicken on it (can't remember the name, but they didn't scrimp on the protein like some places do).  It was okay, I'd have to come back during a busier time to test their wait staff.  My client loved the carne asada tacos.
