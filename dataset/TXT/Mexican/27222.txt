3FiTfmHWr1TbDbaepDrC2A First time we tried this place so i'll give it 3 stars.
The food was fresh but barely warm.
We came in at 8:45 p and it was moderately busy (a few people in line) 
Food looked Fresh.  I have never been to a cafe Rio ever so, this was my first impression. This place is kinda like Rubios meets Chipotle. My favorite thing about the place was the small menu which made it easy to order but, 'Note-To-Owner' if you are going to put your make line right in front for all of your customers to see  -- there's an expectation that your staff will keep it cleaner than usual. Yikes! 
I would expect to see a restaurant in this shape if it had had an absentee owner -- not a brand new restaurant 3 weeks old. 
The make line was Gross. Dried beans, empty bins, food everywhere. The window guard was dirty with cream sauce and who knows what.   Then as we were eating they started taking down the hood filters for cleaning -- over the grills and make line. While people were standing in line ordering food. Seriously? I dont know who was in charge ( There in lies the main problem-- if you go to any fast food chain restaurant a customer can always spot the manager in a minute) i couldn't here. 
Really three weeks in ???
I counted 8 staff at least and yet the floor in the dining area was filled with litter, paper, and stuff, we left in :30 minutes and nothing had changed (thats when i decided to take some photos so all y'all wouldnt think i was just being nasty). The garbage was still overflowing, tables that needed to be cleared off & wiped down etc.
We will give them a chance to get their act together then try it again.  But check out these pictures. It was disturbing that no one behind the counter felt this was off in the least. I dont want to imagine what the back of the house looked like.?  I really hope they get it together and get some strong management in place -  they need it badly.
