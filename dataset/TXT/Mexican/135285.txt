IMoMOGoIDabx_Gnkw4-mmg I've been to this location many times over the years.  It's just decent Mexican food.  Fast, tasty and a good price.  It's not as good as Nuevo Acapulco but I certainly wouldn't turn down a trip to have dinner there.  Their 4th star is solely because I was able to get tipsy off of just one margarita...they're strong!  It's also not as busy as other (better) Mexican restaurants so it's nice to not have to wait on a Friday or Saturday night.  It's a very convenient location so I'm sure we'll be back at some point.
