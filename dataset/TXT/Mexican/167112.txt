lrAUseySfmFeZkWOGfsKnQ I noticed the original Taco stand in Scottsdale a while back and was interested due to the Yelp reviews yet we were put off because there was no where to sit and it was date night so even though not required, we prefer a bit more formality  on a Friday night. Anyway, I was interested enough that when they opened a storefront close to home I knew it was a must try. Despite a few negatives, overall it was very good for a quick bite.  

Put off #1 was the service - counter person was a bit impatient and did not really seem like he was behind the product he was there to sling.  Although not all out rude, there was some frostiness about his demeanor.  

Put off #2 has been mentioned in other reviews and is definitely annoying. The chips come in a huge bag which I would not ever imagine myself eating. Sorry I am into portion control on most days and a big bag of tortilla chips is not a worth it for me like a cobbler or cupcakes might be.  Who doesn't like a few chips and salsa with their taco's? Smaller portions please!

Ok, so now the good stuff:

Flavor of meats, flour tortillas, low, low prices and the worth it sugar fix - a peanut butter cookie!  I did not expect the cookie to be anything special so I was shocked and am kinda embarrassed to say that it was the best part of the meal.

I will definitely be back for more tacos, but no chips and salsa until they break down those big bags.  You bet I will be looking forward to many more cookies.
