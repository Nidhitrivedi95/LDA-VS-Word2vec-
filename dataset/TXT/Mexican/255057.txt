VBVqHnViRLSYAqP7v8iNNQ The food is "just OK".....So Americanized, no real Mexican flavor. Everything I ate needed more spice. OK, so I know we are all Gringos up here in Scottsdale, but really?
Give us some authentic Mexican food and you will stay in business for years to come!
The chips need to be served heated, the Guac needs to be more fresh, and the Spinach Enchiladas?  Spinach my foot, almost solid cheese! Not healthy for you at all!
I love the idea that you are in Market Street now, but PLEASE get it together and bring some quality and flavor to your food!
