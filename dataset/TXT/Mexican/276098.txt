Don't know about you, but I tend to lose my appetite at having to smell sewer gas.  I've been through their drive-thru twice with a 3 month period.  So it's been that way for months now and they've done nothing about it.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who has noticed the stench.  Definitely not going back to this establishment.
