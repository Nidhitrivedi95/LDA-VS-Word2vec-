f-Nk4rNCmJhYom1_6RdWqg I had the seafood burrito for dinner on Friday night.  I was violently ill for the next 12 plus hours and remain sick.  Presently, I am on day 3 of recovering from food poisoning.

I have a pretty strong stomach.  The last time I had food poisoning for over 10 years ago and this includes a lot of eating foods of other countries including Egypt and Afghanistan. 

PLEASE eat somewhere else.  I wouldn't wish this upon anyone!
