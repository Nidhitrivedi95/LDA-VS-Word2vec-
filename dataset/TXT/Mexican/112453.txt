G7LYpILnHveyvbg3sJePPw Happened upon this place after seeing the line-up at L'avenue. Decent menu - everything is price at 4.95$ which is amazing! Ordered a vegetarian sandwich with the soup and a side of fries (which I thought would be a a little extra - but it was treated as a separate dish - should've checked). Food was good, service can be a bit slow but all in all, I liked the place and wouldn't ming going there again.
