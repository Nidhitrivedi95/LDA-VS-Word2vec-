I1qgWmIEIpnZF-uj6F-aCw The food here was real good. Beer was not cold....had to get a bucket of ice for it to chill. Needs a renovation yesterday.....Jon Taffer! !!! Place hasn't been cleaned in months. Wanted to play horseshoes and ping pong. ....no lights working. One volleyball court was all booked up. Probably won't be back.....until they remodel and clean.
