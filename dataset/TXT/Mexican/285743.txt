Y91-sIlVyH6v4YM6sTINAw so i came to order dinner at this location never had i ordered here before, when i go to the window to pay the girl forgot to give me my sprite until i reminded her then i asked for hot sauce she doesnt even asked which one she gives me a red sauce so i asked for the green one after i ask for it she rolled her eyes trying to pull it off acting like she had something in her eye! and thats just the customer service & she forgot to give me my bbq for my chicken tenders, not to mention the french fries are old & cold taste like they were from yesterday & the chicken bowl is disgusting the rice in the bowl is raw for it being my first time here i expected it to be good never ordering from here again! that cashier was rude & the food was cold old and nasty!!
