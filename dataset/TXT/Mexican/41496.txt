7-Ba9uSmYYpXgnQRoIPxMQ We really enjoyed eating at the restaurant but both times I've ordered delivery from this place I've been severely disappointed and will not be frequenting this place any longer. 

Last time our salad didn't have any dressing among other mistakes and this time both items I bought didn't come with the sauce listed on the menu. When I called to complain they said that they had run out of the sauce and that the sauce was free so they didn't charge me for it. 

All it would have taken was for someone to notify me that the sauce was out and I would have ordered something different.   I don't care about the cost of the sauce. I would pay for not free sauce. 

In the end both the delivery company and this restaurant did not take responsibility for what is basically the equivalent of two dry meat salads with no sauce that I am unable to eat and had to pay $40 for.  

I'm very disappointed and bummed out because normally I really love the food here and actually tried to introduce a friend to this place but since the food is basically inedible it's a terrible introduction.
