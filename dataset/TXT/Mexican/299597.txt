ZkUWOdBA4T7pdUhT0dkRzQ Finally an Arizona restaurant that knows there is more to Mexican cuisine than that coming from Sonora through Texas.  My wife and I went there today primarily because we saw the words "Mexico City" in a write-up.  What a pleasant surprise.  Walking in we were in a bright, cheerful, uncrowded dining area.  Our waiter encouraged questions about menu items and he knew the answers.  My wife ordered Chiles En Nogada and I had Cochinita Pibil.  Both dishes were wonderful (and we will have more than ample amount for lunch tomorrow).  Our home owners association is going there next week.  You bet we will be with them!
