LoCnjxSpQBoFLNWAmbmTqw Got the $5 meal box. Was the saddest thing I ordered from Carl Jrs. The frys were cold and soggy, the burger and chicken sandwich were flat/soggy and unflavored. The chicken strip kids meal had one tiny stop that was the size of one McDonald's nuggets. Thought Carl's was going to be a treat and drove 20 minutes just to be let down
