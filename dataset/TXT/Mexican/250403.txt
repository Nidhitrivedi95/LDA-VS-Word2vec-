UJewG9UgVXQ7fyP4UHwnxw When I saw "America's" taco shop I thought it was meaning US, but to my surprise it's after the owner named America :) 

What a great surprise! It's quite authentic, the tortillas, the meats, the salsas, the menu items, even fresh Jamaica and horchata DELICIOUS!   

I wish they had more locations, I would eat here more often. Needless to say, when I'm near by I stop by.
