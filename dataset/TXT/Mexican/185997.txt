nwHd2MbIGz0SNG8GpFjekw We ordered a bunch of food to go from here. Good prices but it took longer than we thought it would for the food to be ready. 

The tacos are really great! I asked for them mild and they were not spicy at all (good if you don't love spicy food).  The only one they couldn't make less spicy was the pastor. 

I liked the chicken taco the best. Overall, all of the tacos are very flavorful. The waitstaff are friendly and the space is a decent size, including a few tab;es outside.
