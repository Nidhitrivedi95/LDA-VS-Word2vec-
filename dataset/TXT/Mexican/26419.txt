3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ Lunch date...ambiance great.  After we receive our drinks we are told they are out of beef and pork.  What?  How can you be a taco restaurant and be out of the 2 most popular meats for tacos?  Waitress was spacey and brought only half of my date's order.  Salsa was good...chips over cooked.  Too bad...such a cute place.  Won't be back.
