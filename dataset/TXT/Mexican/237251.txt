SW6ZQk22G1_CV81_gfnvNQ I've never given a Yelp review but felt I had to after my visit.  I HATE cilantro.  HATE it but absolutely love Mexican food.  I noticed that certain items on the menu had cilantro in their descriptions so I was planning on opting for the tacos that did not have any in it but the server told me that every taco had cilantro and due to their "no mods" policy, I couldn't ask for it not to be added.  I understand not being able to take it out of a sauce but it's absolutely ridiculous to refuse to not put it on as garnish.  I mean, come on!  Stop being so pretentious.  Cilantro is one of those flavours that some people have a serious aversion to and if you are going to make that ridiculous rule then please put some tacos on that don't have that repulsive ingredient in them!  For this reason, I won't return.  Sorry but if you are going to charge that much for your food then I'd like it to be food that I can truly enjoy without having to pick out an ingredient that I detest.
