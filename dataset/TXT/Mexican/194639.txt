OTcBXjDkViDPds4Lxy8KIQ So we got here 630 sat waiting for our food til 730, when I asked for someone to check our order I guess it got lost skipped misplaced. Not sure what happened. The lady that took my order went to the register to look it up.  She said the printer went down. They compd our meal and gave us chips and salsa. Will update review after we get our meal

Ok so after meal update food was very flavorful. Little spicy had me sweating. Will come back will just keep an eye on our order.  Will try red sauce next time.
