Ns20WGWn6s6niKAGIQB4UQ Had a craving for Mexican food and had to come here. I've been here once or twice so I was familiar with their fare. Sat outside in the sunshine of a cool fall day and ordered some chips and salsa and three tacos. The salsa here is split between a green and red. Both are fantastic for different reasons. Just when you think you've picked a fav of the two you taste the other and change your mind. So just eat both and get the best of both worlds. My only wish they were a bit more spicy. I like my salsa hot. But that's a personal preference. The tacos - one barbacoa, one pacific chicken and one carne asada. All three were amazing. Loaded with the various proteins and their own accompaniment. Just delicious. They aren't huge, nor are they small - basically, they are Goldilocks - just right. The servers were very friendly - specifically Michele, who had a constant smile. You gotta eat here if you get a chance. Great food, location and price.
