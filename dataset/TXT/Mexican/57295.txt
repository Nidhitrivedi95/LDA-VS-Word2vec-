a8pmtlVKf7NiSLI-4KejIw First time dining here at El Catrin and in the Distillery District actually.  Decor and ambiance was very impressive with Mexican beats and Dawn of the Dead makeup for the house staff (a special every 3rd Saturday we were told).  We opted for the $40 7-course taster menu for our huge dinner party, as per our server's glowing recommendations and because we wanted to sample a good variety of Mexican fare without having to comb through the menu.  Don't know the exact names of the various dishes but our table gave overwhelmingly rave reviews for the freshly made guacamole and chips, alcohol-infused watermelon and fish tacos.  Only negative comment is that it's quite pricey at $40 per person, especially for the tapas portion sizes that are served.  One meat course required splitting between 2 people, c'mon!  Service was very prompt and friendly though.  Glad we tried El Catrin this one time but probably wouldn't return because of the comparatively low value for dollar, too bad...if we did, we wouldn't ever do the taster menu again and just order a la carte.
