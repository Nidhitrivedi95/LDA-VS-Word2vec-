OA5Li3ySzhrbG_WvD_QGYA I went in with high expectations after hearing great things and was not disappointed. As busy as it was on a Saturday night, they offered us a table by the bar to seat us as quickly as possible. Our waiter was attentive and made sure we were happy even though it was clear he was super busy and had many people to take care of. Overall a fun place (bubble in taco orders!), great (and cheap!) food and drinks, and fantastic service!
