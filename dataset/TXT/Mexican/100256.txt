eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg This is a must try if you are in the neighborhood. It is not your typical Mexican restaurant, this has more of a Oaxacan cuisine than the usual Mexican fare. 

To start off, they don't serve chips and salsa while you wait for your food, instead you get bread and Tapenade, totally awesome. I ordered Chilaquiles de Mole and it was the best I've ever had. The portion was quite large as well.

The place is very small and they tried to squeeze in as many tables in there as possible which made the place too stuffy and too close to other people dining in; and I presume it could get too noisy as well. I got in here early so it wasn't too crowded, although it might not be a comfortable place for a cozy dinner on a Saturday night.
