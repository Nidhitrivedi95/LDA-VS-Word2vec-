lrAUseySfmFeZkWOGfsKnQ Dude. These tacos are BOMB. Now my 5-star isn't the toughest to obtain but if I say "WOW that is a good taco" multiple times, and the service is kind, and nothing else goes quite wrong, it gets a 5-star. 
Chicken was AWESOME and grilled legitimately, and same with the beef. Warning - the red sauce is pretty spicy! Give it a shot before you douse!! Green sauce was creamy and WONDERFUL. Pico de gallo and limes added a great touch. Would love to hit it again someday! Give it a shot if you love street tacos.
