1dhPgc7E7IzzpxjHM2LphQ I can't say enough about this Mad Mex location! Great margaritas and they're half price after 10 (only $7). They also have half price food from 11-1 which is awesome to satisfy your late night cravings. My favorite item on the menu is the carnitas burrito, however, my friends and I always order the nachos grande as well. Rochelle, the bartender, is amazing and my friends and I find ourselves venturing in late at night just to see her and have one of her amazing margs. Would highly recommend :)
