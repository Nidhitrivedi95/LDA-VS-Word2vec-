Ns20WGWn6s6niKAGIQB4UQ What a great place! We sat on the patio, which was really nice to people watch. I'm not sure if there were hooks on tables or the bar rail, if so great, but if not, it would be nice because I had no where to put my purse. I had it sitting on the bar rail and it made me really nervous when a gentleman that was mumbling to himself came walking by. 

I really liked the salsa and how they served it in squeeze bottles. I had the Pacific Chicken Burrito and I thought it was quite tasty and fresh. My daughter had a bean burrito and it looked very fresh. My husband had the Barbacoa bowl and he said it was good. We only had water to drink, because we were on our way to a musical and didn't want to be tired. But their drink menu looked promising for our return visit. 

The prices just blew me away! I couldn't believe the chips and salsa were a dollar (happy hour) and my burrito was under nine dollars. Our entire meal including tip was $25.00. That's pretty unbelievable for an app, and three meals. 

I should also mention that everyone we came in contact with was so nice! No pretentiousness to be found, and you've really gotta love a place like that, especially when you're a little older and you think a place only caters to the young and hip. 

Can't wait to come back with just hubby or girlfriends and catch a show.
