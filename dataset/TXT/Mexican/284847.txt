Y1lzSa9u-XqzC7RrQO2nig I've been to this restaurant numerous times.  I have never had a bad experience, in fact I'm going tonight to celebrate a birthday with a friend.  I've been there when it was pretty empty and when it was packed without noticing a difference.  The employees are very friendly and accommodating.  The food is spectacular.  Everything I have tried reminds me of my own visit to Mexico.  I highly recommend this restaurant to all of my friends and family.  If you want authentic Mexican go here!  You'll love it!
