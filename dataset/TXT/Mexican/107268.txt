fqMAnoS2sTokz6lqBSmoCw Not impressed. While the space is beautiful, the food & drinks were underwhelming. I started with the sangria. Kind of tasted like cider (it has cinnamon) no fruit and seemed like no alcohol. Was let down by the size (looked to be no more than an 8oz glass with ice) for a steep $7. For appetizer, had the chicharrones (pork rinds). Those were good! The taco menu needs to have the ingredients listed with the names. It required too much explanation from the server. While she was enthusiastic and patient, she was also slightly condescending sharing with us that these tacos were authentic and don't have shredded cheese & sour cream... but we weren't asking for that at all. I know what a damn taco is, I just want to know what's in the one I'm about to order!  The tacos were fresh, but I think all mine had flour when I ordered one of them to have corn tortilla. My shrimp taco leaked oil water a lot. 
She also raved about the salsa bar and that was also underwhelming.. they all seemed to taste the same and just have a liquid consistency. 
All in all, I just think I'll come back for beer and atmosphere. Maybe I'll try the guacamole because they said that was made fresh. But until then, I'm happy to have my tacos and fresh salsa bar somewhere else (locally owned Sabor is amazing if anyone needs a recommendation)
