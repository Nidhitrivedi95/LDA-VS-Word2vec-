The last three times I have been to Cafe Rio my order has been completely wrong not my co-works but mine every time. I was not going to ever go back but two of my coworkers talked me in to giving in one more chance my order was wrong again I asked for pulled pork I get chicken. I ask for no beans and double rice I end up with neither. 

I only have 30 minutes for lunch and it's a 20 min drive round trip with traffic so, I have to call in my order so, I can have a few minutes to eat. I have spoken to two different managers at the same location and, even then they mess up the first time I went back after work the first manager tried to refund my card and, ended up charging my a second time for the full order than gave me cash back for one so nothing was solved. 
 
The newest manager I spoke with today was insistent that the order I got was right since the name on the order was a woman maybe they messed up my order, I told the manager I placed the ordered and, regardless what the recipe shows the meat is wrong even by the recipe. I am more frustrated with the lack of attention to simply detail that is shown for simple food I will never go to any Cafe Rio again. I rather go to Taco Bell at least they can get my order right and that's not saying much.
