Bf2fuqWbHd3L-X69FSMvmg Went here for lunch and must recommend.  We ordered the guac and the al pastor tacos.  While the tacos probably won't fill a single person with an above average appetite for dinner, it was the right size for lunch. Besides, the pork was nicely seasoned, the pineapple worked really well with it, and was great with the chipotle salsa they provided at the table (not as good with the verde...).  The guac was smooth and delicious.   The great thing about this place is the salsas they give you at the table pull no punches, they're actually spicy (a little spicy though, nothing that'll make your nose run). 

Can't wait to try this place for brunch!
