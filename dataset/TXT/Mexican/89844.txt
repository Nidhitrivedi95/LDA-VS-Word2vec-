DuQtouEXOfo5K4ukON3qwQ Wanted to try some place new so hubby picked this place. We started with the shrimp and fish ceviche. I wish there was more fish and shrimp but the flavor was tasty. Then for entrees, he got the traditional burro with carne adovada and I got the chile relleno with shrimp. The meat in his burro was so tender and had good flavor and my entree was delicious! A good amount of shrimp inside and a perfect cheese ratio and some spice. Our server was great! Wish I remembered his name. But very nice guy. 
Definitely will be back.
