qB9qJ5MY4vyAFJRpmJ3iNQ So we would love to see this restaurant succeed, because a tex mex restaurant on Montford is just what we needed! We went with a group of 5 on Saturday night and it was not too crowded.. No wait... But after ten minutes a server came to us to get a drink order. We had never been given a drink or dinner menu. We asked for a drink menu and she looked confused and gave us a beer list. It had no info on margaritas etc. we asked her about margaritas and she said they had frozen or on the rocks. I ordered frozen and she showed back up 20 minutes later with on the rocks. When I said that I ordered frozen she said that I was stuck with on the rocks because the machine was broken. Weird. Chips and salsa were no flavor... very bleh. They serve a hot and mild and the hot is suler hot which is fine but neither have any flavor. W finally got menus and water after about 30 minutes of sitting. Entrees were all pretty good... But we ordered guacamole and it was basically mashed avocado with no seasoning or flavor. How hard is it to mess up guac? Ad we ordered a roasted stuffed jalepeno app and it had no flavor at all. They ran out of beer glasses and the waitress totally screwed up a beer pour of a 6 dollar beer. All foam. She also stopped at our table to " show us" another tables food . So weird. Overall we thought about leaving a couple of times... Probably should have. The whole room they put us in cleared out at 9:30 so we sat by ourselves for about 45 until we got our food. Overall dissapointed. They could make simple tweaks to correct food and also work on service mucho!!! Also change menu to explain food ( like how many tacos come on a plate?).
