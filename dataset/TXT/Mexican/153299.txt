k-drEjxKmfqllwfY90STfA Incredible!! Took some visiting family there last weekend and had a fantastic experience! The food and the service was outstanding! I had the chicken torta (sandwich), family had the chimichanga and we also had the guacamole they make at the table. Everything was simply fantastic!
