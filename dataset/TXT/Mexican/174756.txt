MNkykJJM2tXrYA_cMPkkUA Found this little hole in the wall and read Risa's review so I thought I'd step in.  It had the heavy scent of fresh taco chips just being fried.  In the back I saw the deep fryer, what looked to be a burrito press and a friendly guy offering his homemade items.  I asked him if I could try some of his chips freshly fried.  He said sure and they tasted good!  So I purchased some chips and fresh salsa!  Will update a bit later on with the fresh salsa!  

Update on the salsa: This salsa is amazing with a good amount of heat!  So fresh tasting and 100X better than the Doritos crappolla and anything else in a jar!  It makes me wonder why I ever eat salsa out of a glass jar???
