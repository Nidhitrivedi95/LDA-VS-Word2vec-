mlc5N9qL6UYbtcwzVqgmzw Under no circumstances go to the Roadhouse in Cave Creek on a Tuesday night as you will be blasted out of the building due to the most god awful Karaoke known to man-kind!!!  Someone managing this place is actually dumb enough to think something this obnoxious will increase business.  It is beyond comprehension that anyone involved with a biker bar would think that bikers would want to listen to such pathetic entertainment.  What an insult to the bikers of Phoenix!  Bottom line spend your money elsewhere!
