GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog I came here twice with my girlfriend on our trip to Vegas because we really liked it the first time. Here's what we ate:

- Steamed Chinese pork buns 
     == Yummy. I've been eating Chinese steamed pork buns since I was a little kid. These ALMOST taste like the ones my grandmother made. So good
- Flautas in mole sauce 
     == These little crispy guys were decent. The mole sauce was pretty tasty, but this dish wasn't mind blowing. 
- Beef Shu Mai 
     == I've had tons of shu mai before, but these guys were a little different with the watermelon radish on top and a little bit of lime zest. Don't get me wrong, they were yummy, but had a little something different from homestyle shu mai.
- Pozole Rojo
     == This was the best dish of the entire night. The soup was spicy full of flavor. The pork was super tender and the additional radish, avocado, onion, and cabbage made the dish phenomenal. I would come back here for the pozole. My only complaint is that it was a tad on the salty side.
- Chicharron Quesadilla
     == A quesadilla is a quesadilla. This one just happened to have crispy little chicharron pieces in it. It also came with a spicy chili sauce. 

We also had some drinks there (The Singapore Sling, The Orient, Blood Orange margarita and Pomegranate margarita) and they were all delicious. The Singapore Sling is a sweet and fruity drink so if that's your style, go for that. The Orient was like a fancy spruced up gin and tonic. The Blood Orange margarita was awesome and spicy. The pomegranate margarita had a salt foam on top which was totally different, but a little too much of it for my liking. 

Overall, a win. I came here twice during my Vegas stay. That has to mean something, right?
