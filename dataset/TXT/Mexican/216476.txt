R68SX1-FFLvv6BqsK9-Alw The tacos were okay.... My beer was barely cold, I had a burgundy colored hair wrapped around my mahi mahi taco which really made me sick. Any good restraunt would have just taken it off the bill. But nope. They discounted it 5$... I had to wait to eat while they remade my taco. The mahi , cod and sword fish -they taste exactly the same so save a few bucks and just get the cod. Lol  I like trying new places but I probably won't ever come here again. Don't waste your money-- del tacos fish tacos taste better
