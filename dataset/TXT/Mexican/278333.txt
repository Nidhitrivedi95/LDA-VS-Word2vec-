XMrLwzmEAsfNpbKRC7vUzQ This is probably the best sports bar/ restaurant you can go to if you really focus on watching to game. The way the tvs are set up you can see 6 tvs without moving your head. While that might seem like something a lazy person might say, it's important when you want to keep up with your fantasy football or of you want to watch baseball and football. The food is really good. I got a regular burger and it was pretty good. I also tasted the honey Chipotle wings and they where good. The service was good too. This isnt the type of place you go to sit down and eat a meal at. Because it's a sports bar it's loud sometimes but the perfect place to watch the game and have a burger or wings. I like this one better than some others because they don't rely on a few big tvs or projectors. They have the LCDs everywhere visible. Perfect set up and good food.
