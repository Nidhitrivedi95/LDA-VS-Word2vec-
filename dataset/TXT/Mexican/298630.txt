zJGtD3y-pAIGNId4codEEg Normally my family and I come here for breakfast on Sunday on the food and service are great. Tonight we came for dinner and couldn't be more disappointed. There were four of us and we had to wait..."to clean off a table" we were told. 15 mins later in a virtually empty restaurant we were seated. 
Waiter took our drink and appetizer order. Food can put first? How? They had two bartenders on staff and the place is not busy. Waiter has no idea about food service. We completely finished both appetizers before the waiter finally showed up with our three drinks. 
After I downed mine pretty quickly he came by to tell us our Pollo asado order would be delayed yet another 20 minutes. Put that on top of 20 we waited BEFORE he told us this. WTF??  Oh, and he never asked if I wanted another drink. Hey pal...Waiter 101 - Restaurants make a whole lot more on drinks than they do food. 
While I would have recommended this place for breakfast I must warn evening diners to drop this place from the list of possibles. You will be sorry. Apparently everyone on the night shift for a Sunday is pretty damn incompetent. 

Ok, so I was contacted by the "new" manager who admitted they have some staffing issues to resolve. He did the customary request for us to return soon but I asked him to contact me when issues were resolved and we'd be happy to return. To date, I haven't heard a word. So, on faith, we showed up again on Sunday at about 12:15pm. Told it's a 20 minute wait. Cannot use bar high top because "the kitchen is behind" per the hostess. I see things have not changed after months. Let's see how the service is. More to follow.
