oDxvrLYe5SiQKdJlGhheoA Everything was amazing.  Food, service, price, we will for sure be back.   The staff was busy because the place was packed but the service was exceptional.  Very friendly and checked on us multiple times.  They don't have tamales but the chili rellenos are dynamite.   Chips fresh, salsa fresh.  It was all so yummy.
