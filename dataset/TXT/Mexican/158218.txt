knWBvogziOE4f82kmmi0sQ After hearing from a former employee I visited on Saturday early afternoon. Greeted at door and sat at bar. Ordered some beef flautas and a beer. Very busy with lots of people and staff. Food very good service a little slow but I did say they were busy. Will be back after newness wears off.
