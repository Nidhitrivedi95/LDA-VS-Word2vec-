7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA We were actually planning to go somewhere else for lunch when this place caught our eye.  There seemed to be a decent number of people in the restaurant, plus the plates of food they were plunking down right in front of the window looked tasty enough to change our plans.

A little slow getting to our table to take our order, but the food came out quite quickly once we ordered.  They were good at refilling coffee as well, which was nice.  I had the pulled pork on a crusty bun.  While messy, it was very tasty, minus the one big bite of cilantro I got (but I'm not a huge cilantro fan, so your mileage may vary).  My Mom had the club sandwich, which looked really good - bacon, chicken and nice slices of avocado.  We both had the borscht as our accompanying dish and that was really tasty, to the point where I was kind of sad when I got to the bottom of the bowl.

We went at an off-peak time (14:30 or so on a Friday afternoon) so waiting wasn't something we had to deal with.  It's not food that I'd be willing to sit in the rain waiting for a seat to open up for, but there aren't many places that I'd give that designation to anyways.  

Prices were good for the size of the meals - big sandwich and a pretty reasonable helping of soup each with two coffees for about $30.  Definitely had worse for less out there.
