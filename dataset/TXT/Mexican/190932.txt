We shared the Arizona burrito: pork chile verde in a burrito, topped with tomatillo salsa, and cheese, with two over easy eggs.  It was delicious and we ate every last bite.  The Bloody Mary was very good and the service was excellent.  So, if you are ever held over at PHX, this is a pretty cool place to hang out.
