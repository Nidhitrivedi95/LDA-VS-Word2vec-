iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg Made it here as the 7th stop of our 7 restaurant hopping afternoon last night. Made it 30 mins before closing time and it was perfect time to order, eat and catch our breath before getting up again. The tortilla was great, not too greasy but definitely enough good grease lol We got the baja and octopus (they were out of cerviche :( apparently a big seller, next time I'll make it earlier)

Both were great and stuffed to the brim. Their salsas were delicious, the hot is actually hot! It's a serve yourself type of salsa bar with limes and cutlery. I definitely needed the forks because the taco had so much filling I ate half of it before i could close it. 

Not a lot of sitting room (4 seats)but more standing room with wall tables. The staff was friendly and personable. Definitely going back :) Carnitas and cerviche calling my name! They also have good sodas, guava and pineapple flavor.
