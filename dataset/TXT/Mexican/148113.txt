jrGxdAblwBmRG6K-dDpKbQ Wow I hate to give a place with a really good pupusas such a low rating but the service was really bad and the funny thing is that there was only two tables being occupied. Only one cook and only one waitress who once we got our food forgot about us and even when I called her over took forever to come and forgot part 2 of my request. I think the authentic flavor of this location can really hit it big except they need to step it up a notch ! Awesome food but taking to go next time, place is really hot a/c needs to be turned on. Omg I'm almost temped to lower one more star but the quality keeps it at 3
