H8p7tEvUmJ2sTxxdmxnrMg Went into this place on a weekday for lunch and had to wait 10 mins to be seated, although there was only 1 other couple in there, After we were seated, it took another 10 minutes for the server to get my drink order. Finally after i placed my order, it took 45 minutes for the food to come out, which was cold, when my boyfriend (who is mexican) told the waitress that the tacos were cold, she had the chef remake them. When they came back out they were still cold. She should have just left it at that, but she proceeded to tell him that that's how they were supposed to be served, lukewarm. I can tell you he was not happy. We had to leave because we were late for work at this time. Will never go back to this place, if i could give it less stars than 1, i would.
