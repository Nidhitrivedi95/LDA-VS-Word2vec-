I tried 3 different tacos. Carnitas and short rib tacos were pretty good, but the chicken tacos were definitely the best. The lime crema was just awesome. 

Drink selection was decent. Would have been nice to have some more local craft beers. House margarita was good, not amazing, and not as strong as I like my margaritas. 

Don't know that I'd go for a full sit-down dinner, but a great option for lunch or drinks with some decent food.
