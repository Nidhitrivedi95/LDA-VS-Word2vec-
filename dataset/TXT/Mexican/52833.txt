9kk7eaffUzXwh-KLmKLxzw Nice atmosphere compared to all the other sea food restaurants that I have been to in West Phoenix.  Only negative part is they don't make my favorite fish ceviche only shrimp ); also the waitress was MIA we waited for water to be refilled and took for ever.  But when we got our check we got charged for 2 drinks and 2 tostadas when I only ordered one of each ): waitress was not to friendly might of had a bad morning ...
