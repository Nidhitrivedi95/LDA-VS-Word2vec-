S3qs5ZAZgqDvM88jj17hbQ I enjoyed Carlos & Pepe's each of the times I have been there, they have fantastic deals to get you in (drinks AND food) and the quality of the food meets expectations. 

If you're paying a dollar per taco, don't expect something gourmet, it's a taco. Good place to fill your belly and have a beer, ambiance is good and service is good.
