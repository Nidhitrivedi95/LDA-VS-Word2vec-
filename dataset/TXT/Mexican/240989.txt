TcCWYYL6FxBTT6KrxabwRg Good tacos at a good price, $5.00 + tax for two.   
Fresh ingredients and about 6 different salsa's that are labeled ( a real +).
Had the carne asada, the chunks of meat were tough and overcooked, probably not a good choice since steak tacos at most places are tough and overcooked.  Also, had the carnitas taco which was very good, a much better choice.  
Edgar seems to have some specials for the day but found the day I was there that the menu only had 4 taco meat choices and would prefer a another option.  There is the option for Tostadas, burritos and a few other Mexican selections.

Cash only.
