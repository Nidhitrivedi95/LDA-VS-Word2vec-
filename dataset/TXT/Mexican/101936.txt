ewhYqXL8jLrNpwQGnGIhyw I had the super burrito, with no sour cream or cheese. The meat had little seasoning if any. As I ate, I tried to taste the flavor of the ingredients and mostly I tasted the beans. I could hardly taste or even see the pico de gallo or the guacamole that it's supposed to have. I bit into bits of onions, but that's not pico de gallo. There were no tomatoes or cilantro in their "pico de gallo".  

The meat was a bit chewy and I could tell it had been sitting around. It had the taste of old meat. It was passable if you add hot sauce to mask the flavor. But, next time IF I go back, I'd rather just have the rice and bean burrito (not sure if they have one).  BTW, the hot (red) sauce was neither spicy nor salty enough for me.   

Overall, I don't think this was worth $7+. I won't be going back here anytime soon.
