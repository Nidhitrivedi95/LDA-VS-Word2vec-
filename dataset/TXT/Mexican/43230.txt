7F0ccIsqZSaqi1r7SB4nfQ My wife and I popped into this place tonight after noticing it the previous night on a walk and knowing my love for Mexican food (I am originally from California).  We had the salsa and guac with root chips to start and it was awesome!  Both salsa and guac were very fresh and the chips were a nice change from the traditional tortilla chips.

For the meals, we had the deconstructed tacos with the braised beef and the burrito with the braised chicken.  My wife loved the tacos and the meat was perfectly cooked.  The burrito was huge and quality through and through - reminiscent of my time back in California with an upscale factor to it.

We were not planning on dessert, but when the waitress said churros, my pregnant wife and my belly couldn't resist. This is not your typical churro, as it's almost like churro minis and it comes with a strawberry mousse to dip.  You get all the flavor of a traditional churro with a unique twist!

They don't yet have a liquor license so if you are looking for drinks, it will be a little longer, but it's worth trying now just for the food!
