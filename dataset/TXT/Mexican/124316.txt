HPIuW67C3FJrTsPs9RCkuA I came here one night with my friend who lives in Henderson and we were looking for a place to eat.  We got here late, around 11PM, so it was not crowded at all.  We sat ourselves and looked through the menu while our server brought us chips and salsa to snack on.  After looking the menu over, I decided to order off of their specials menu.  I ended up with a burrito (shredded chicken) and taco (shredded beef) combo plate that came with rice and beans for $7.  When it came out , the food was really hot but that's a good thing because it meant they just cooked it.  In the end, I couldn't finish the plate but was like 95% of the way there.  The food was good for a chain type Mexican place but doesn't match up to the taquerias I've been to in the Bay Area.  However, it's open late and good for quenching those late night hunger pangs.
