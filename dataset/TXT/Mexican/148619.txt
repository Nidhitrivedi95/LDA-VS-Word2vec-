This place is absolutely amazing. The food is fresh, delicious, and authentic. The servers were very attentive; they always kept our glasses filled and checked up on us constantly. I came here with my husband and his family and we were a group of 14. While we waited for our food, the chef gave us complimentary chips and salsa and THE BEST chicken wings ever made. My husband got the Longsilog and Korean tacos and I got the breakfast pupusas. We were very impressed with the customer service; the chef/owner even gets out on the floor serving food and chatting with his clients. Can't wait to come back.
