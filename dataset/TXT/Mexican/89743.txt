DublKfLa9Y0PguCryoDJ-Q The restaurant is very appealing on the eyes. Nice and upbeat. When we first arrived the hostess greeted us and began answering our questions when the phone rang. Another hostess walked up and in a demeaning tone advised that she should have answered the phone. Not a great way to start the dining experience. We were sat at table #32 and greeted by a cheerful waiter. He cracked a joke and it all went down hill from there. It took 45mins for our table side guacamole to make its way to the table. Upon arrival, another 25mins for our entrees. All the while, our waiter did not check in on our table, but seemed to find his way to every other table in the section. We had to flag down someone to check on our food, who happened to be a manager. Our entrees came out wrong and cold! Thanks to the manager Chelsea who seemed to be the only one concerned about turning our experience around. 4 words: We won't be back.
