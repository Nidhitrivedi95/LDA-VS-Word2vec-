K-uQkfSUTwu5LIwPB4b_vg Higher end Mexican place. It's motif is that it is located in an old church.  I have only come here for lunch and it was very good. Prompt service and food is delicious.  Only knock is it's very dark, even during day for lunch.  I hope to soon go back for dinner.  I'd definitely recommend checking this place out.
