Catering is a new feature at Chipotle and when I started planning for a smaller surprise birthday party, I thought I'd give this a shot. To place a catering order, you have to call a 1-800 number and they dispatch your order to a location near you. My experience on the phone wasn't the best (the lady repeatedly got my name wrong and snapped at me a few times), so I was a little nervous about my order. And as I already mentioned, this Chipotle location isn't always on their game.  But thankfully, my catering order was on point.

I showed up a little past my pick up time and my order was still being prepared. Had I been in a hurry, this might have been disastrous, but I tried to look on the bright side and told myself that it was good to be getting super fresh food.  All of my food was boxed or bagged up and nicely labeled. Two employees carried everything to my car and let me know where to find my instructions, Sterno cans, and everything else that was included. When I got home, I found nice labels on the pans of food as well as little cardboard signs to put near each of the dishes.

To be honest, I didn't set everything up myself. My mother did, but she said that she appreciated the instructions for setting up the food - including pictures, the labels on each of the containers, and the other small touches - like books of matches to light the Sterno, extra serving spoons, etc., and extra tortilla chips. An added bonus is that you can keep your catering stands for no additional charge - or you can return/recycle them at the store and get a free burrito.

Everyone at my party was impressed by the food and how nice the catering setup looked. I'd definitely order Chipotle catering for another event. From this or any other locations!
