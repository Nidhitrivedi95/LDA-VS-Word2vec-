3IwCop28R1_L5jMv6AkL8Q Yesterday I had lunch here for the second time. I'm not sure why it took me so long to return because I really enjoyed my lunch each time.

My first visit was on a weekday and keeping lunch to an hour was no problem. My second visit was on a Saturday afternoon and service was efficient and friendly on this visit as well.

Since I couldn't narrow my options I went for a Three Item Combination. My choices were Chile Relleno, Chicken Enchilada, Beef Taquito, and Chicken Taquito. Taquitos count as one choice. I haven't had a ton of chile rellenos, but this was my favorite so far. The flavor was great and the breading was still crispy. The taquitos were crispy and I liked the cheese on top. The red enchilada sauce was very tasty and the chicken inside was nice and tender. The beans and rice on the side were fairly standard and met my craving. 

My husband had the Torta Ahogada. This was served on a large torta bun, stuffed with carnitas, and then smothered in a red sauce. It was a fork and knife torta and my husband enjoyed it.

Pricing on their meals is more than reasonable. It ended up being a bargain for the amount of food. Jalisco's also offers coupons in the mail, Groupons on occasion, and an offer in the Entertainment Book. If you have one of these offers you'll find it to be a great deal for good food.

The restaurant seemed clean and had a fairly large dining room with a nice size bar as well. The parking lot is large and offers plenty of parking.
