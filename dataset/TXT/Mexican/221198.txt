The bad: small portion of guacamole and ceviche for the price and they were out of jamaica.

The ugly: The chips are so incredibly salty, and there was major chipotle overkill on the shrimp taco and ceviche. Seeing ceviche on the menu excited me, but instead of the light and fresh flavor and acid of lime, the overpowering flavor of chipotle decimated the flavor of everything else. It looks pretty in its little tower, but I was so disappointed after a bite or two I let my husband eat the rest. 

Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be coming back - too many other great fish tacos up at Kensington Market at Seven Lives and El Trompo.
