mB_cI1tCrNxxvr2e2myNrQ OK I am an avid Taco Bell groupie. I love love love Taco Bell. 

I love how the food is the same. It still blows my mind that they manage to get their food to taste the same in all 1,000,000,000,000 locations. I don't remember quite exactly, but I think prices are a bit higher than normal TBellz but guys it's the strip and they need to pay rent too!

THE BAJA BLAST: HONEY LISTEN it is dangerously delicious. I got it with Bacardi and I could not taste the alcohol, just all delicious Baja Blast Freeze. I honestly thought they forgot the alcohol but I was content with a regular too, but the buzz was nice. The "yard" is actually fairly small because it's tall and really skinny. I am saving my yard cup for the next time I'm in Vegas to get a cheaper refill, and can't wait to try other flavors.

Job. Well. Done.
