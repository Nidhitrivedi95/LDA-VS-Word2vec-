kXl44keW3wZaJpjEqHk30g Good fresh food. The hamburgers looked amazing, but I decided to get the southwest salad instead.  It was huge...like the size of my face.  I am a bit of a lettuce snob, not that I have to have certain types, but that I can't stand even the slightest bit of brown, limp, or ribby pieces of lettuce so I don't normally get salads at restaurants.  This one was great.  The lettuce was all fresh and crisp and it seemed like every bite had chicken or avocado in it as well.  The salad also came with a chili ranch dressing.  The lady said several times that if we didn't like the chili ranch she would bring us something else, so I don't know if they get a lot of negative feedback on it, but both me and the other guy at the table that ordered it agreed that it was great and really complemented the salad.  High quality fast food, we'll be going back.
