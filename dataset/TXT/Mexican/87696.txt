DKXUkIrFnMUMF535gf-dPA I am from Southern California and found out about Frijoles and Frescas because I saw their awesome commercial on a Facebook post.  Their original location on Charleston was burglarized and they made a fantastic and hilarious commercial from the surveillance footage.

I looked up their website and their pics of their Shrimp Quesadilla looked amazing. I was going to Vegas in a few days and decided to try them (and to support them).

The food is great.  My favorite is the Shrimp Quesadilla.  And the service was outstanding (especially from Patricia who ran the register and gave me and my family samples of every flavor of agua fresca.).

The agua frescas are delicious (watermelon-cucumber is my fave) and they taste fresh.

You can bet that I will come here every time I visit Las Vegas.
