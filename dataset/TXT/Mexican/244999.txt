tNJgmbODR-N0qdPGy4Vsrw Ole! I freakin' love this place. The staff is friendly. The food is awesome. The service is really quick. The best part is, the lunch menu is cheapsies. You can get a really filling, delectable Mexican meal and a (non alcoholic) drink for $9. This is the perfect Friday coworker lunch spot.
