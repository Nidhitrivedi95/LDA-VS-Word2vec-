ZCe93zAkxr2KOBU1NT0lmg Really enjoy the Happy Hour in the Bar. 
Not so much for the specials but the service from Corina.  
She has taken care of My wife and I  a couple times and I find her demeanor to be exactly what I like in a server.  

House Margaritas are good and the Large draft beers are great for the thirsty. 

Had the Fajitas were tasty.  I little light on meat and excessive on Onions but very enjoyable.
