ZfYFo-CZoZAB4sGNOyhoIQ I gave this dive two chances for redemption.
And the food is way over priced, paid $24 for a lunch special and a coffee.
The refried beans where purreed in a blender.
The rice was undercooked.
The sandwich had way too much condiments, lot of bread and little lunch meat. 
The coffee was cheap instant coffee.
Honestly folks I would have been better off going to the grocery store and purchasing the items for a club sandwich with a 2 litter soda.
