UtZgmOHDW_fbXasbTuZhWA First time we ate in.  Used the drive-thru prior to this visit and had a better experience.  From the time we walked in I was not impressed.  I looked around the dining area and saw numerous dirty tables. By the time we ordered, filled our drink cups for which we were told they had run out of straws, and walked the dining area for a table---the dirty tables were STILL DIRTY.  I asked one of the employees to please clean our table and she stated she would be "right back."  TEN MINUTES LATER and watching her clean OTHER DIRTY tables, I asked her a second time to please clean our table before the food came out.  She apologized and came over.  In the meantime, we sat for 20 minutes waiting for my BLT sandwich with onion rings (which were semi raw--I don't like raw onions) and my daughter's Southwest Wrap which had the wrong dressing on it! Next, there were no napkins on the table. Thought I had missed them somewhere, but I was told by the employee that they're supposed to be on the tables...there were no napkins on the tables or anywhere to grab them. She brought some out to us, at that point. The final blow was that they somehow mustered up some straws and were walking around from table to table asking if you wanted a straw. Overall, very disappointing...under staffed to say the least!  A check paid of $22 and change for one mishap after another. I walked out of there still hungry. Next time I will return to my favorite restaurant in that corner area....RAISING CANES.
