b-0q4xbL6EWYUqnwqcYM4Q One star because the service here is horrible if you don't get the young lady. I'm drawing a blank on her name, but I haven't seen her in a couple months, so who knows if she even works here anymore.

I go here because my friends and the teens I work with like this place. The food is okay-- not amazing. I like the queso dip, guacamole here is not good, so I never get it even though it comes with what I order. I usually get a chicken chimichanga because I'm not a fan of the other items. Authentic Mexican tacos have no cheese and have cilantro and onion on top-- this place serves tacos with lettuce and cheese.

There have been several times where our food has been wrong, but if you even take a bite out of the food, you'll get charged for it. If you want to switch veggies, they will, but you'll be charged to put a different veggie, but won't be refunded the one you took off. You will be nickel and dimed here. 

One of the times we came in, our waiter didn't refill our drinks the entire time we were there, AND we had somewhere to be, and we waited for 40 minutes for the check. We were late to cheer practice because he was nowhere to be found. I work with special needs teens, and they love this place, but they also like bland food.... they don't want to come back because they also hate being late, and we usually wait for something every time we go (the check, refills, food takes too long, etc).
