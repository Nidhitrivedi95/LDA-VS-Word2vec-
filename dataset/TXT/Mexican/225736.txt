RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg I love this place!!! I believe it is so much better than Roberto's taco shop here in Vegas. Actually better than most of the other taco shops in general. 

After out drunk bingo night, we decided to fill our stomachs up on the Las Vegas strip and found this place with a huge crowd lined up from the inside out to the edge of the sidewalks onto the street! Lol a little exaggerating but this place is always busy. I can't blame them because they're Mexican authenticity of their food is delicious especially after drinking in the night life. 

When you get to this place, it's so full they have to have security guard the doors to make sure is not over crowded and organizes the lines much easier that way. 

Now as you walk in, there is 3 stations to order from to make the lines quicker on what options you are going for. One line was for Al Pastors, second line was for Asadas, and third line was for others. I had to go with the Al Pastor and Carne Asada Fries  I RECOMMEND THESE OPTIONS! It's so good and full of meat, cheese, fries and toppings just loaded with carbs. 

The menu is pretty moderate on prices and still inexpensive for being on the Las Vegas blvd strip. For my Al pastor fries I only spent $8 and it is a huge serving good for 2-4 people.
