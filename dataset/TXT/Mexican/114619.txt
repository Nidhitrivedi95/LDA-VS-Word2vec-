gGt00WW8sNY2Sop7jYa7Tw So torn on how to rate this place... We love the food, fish tacos are great.  And the owner was great when our son fell off of one of the benches and hit his head.  He immediately checked on him and ran back to get him an ice pack.  But I'm not sure, after going 3x now, if we would go back with kids.  The hostess (I can't remember her name, but it was the same one all 3 times we went) gave us so much attitude and did not make us feel welcome at all, like we were an annoyance and how dare we bring kids... Sorry, but they have to eat too.  She wanted us to sit at a bar top table and have the high chair sit in the aisle, kind of nestled under the table.  My son is 1.5, has been eating everything we eat for about 10 months so there is so way that would have worked or he would have been happy with his head 3-ish ft below table height.  She got annoyed and rolled her eyes at us when we asked if we could sit at a lower table so he could eat with us.  All in all, the food was great but you can get great food elsewhere without the attitude.
