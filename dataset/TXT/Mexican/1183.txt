-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg What is not to Rant & Rave about this place? You have got to try it! So last night the Lady and I decided to try this place. We tried to make the Happy Hour but just missed it by about 20 minutes (FYI, HH is all day until 5pm). Not so bummed b/c the prices were reasonable especially when you factor the OUTSTANDING service and the fresh ingredients. Made to Order corn tortillas for your tacos! It won't get any fresher unless you grind the corn at your table. We had the fish tacos...unbelievable! We usually rate a place by their nachos but already have a new Fav place. Its a mix of people who dine in there retro-ish looking place, low music (which is nice for conversation). Can't wait to go back and try other items like their nachos, aqua fresca and melt your face salsa! See you there
