prdA1r8XP03oD-PYvZJ5AA Grabbed the sliders, on the way to CO and they were great!  Such a pleasant surprise!  They were well priced at $10 for two, with fries.  The burgers were substantial, for sliders, well cooked and seasoned.   The fries were shoe strings and perfectly crunchy and salty.  Will stop by again when traveling next time!
