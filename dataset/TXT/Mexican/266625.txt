WGkqfp1-3130v8xhCb3APg One of my favorite taco places. I have gone by the one in Kent for years and never thought to stop in. Then my boyfriend took me to the one in Lakewood, and my life has been changed. It is way too much food, but that's always a good problem to have. I also highly recommend the queso ... you can't go wrong with it. You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu. 

PLUS, they just added on to the back of the Lakewood one. I used to always be worried the wait would be too long or it would be too crowded at get a good seat. But with the recent addition, I am never worried about the wait anymore. It's so great!
