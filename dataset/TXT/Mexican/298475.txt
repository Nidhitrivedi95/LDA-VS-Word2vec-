zJGtD3y-pAIGNId4codEEg It's too bad that my wife won't give a restaurant a second chance if the first visit isn't good. I think Otro might be capable of being repeat-worthy but they blew it on our first visit.  First, here are the misses: They brought me a chicken taco instead of a veggie taco, my daughter got chocolate chip pancakes instead of regular pancakes and my wife ordered an over-easy egg on her tamale and got one fried hard and brown.  The tamale was also a masa brick. More masa does not make a tamale better.  The mistakes were corrected but nothing was offered to make amends. 

There are some good points to mention. My tacos were delicious. The tortillas tasted fresh and homemade.  The decor is nice and I like the small size of the cafe.
