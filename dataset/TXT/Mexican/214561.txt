QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA Very good Mexican restaurant just near the main Strip area (right near Planet Hollywood). They have unique nacho dishes worth trying along with traditional Mexican and Tex-Mex food. Servers are very nice and like a sports bar type of atmosphere with lots of sports games on TVs everywhere. It's a good and fine place to bring kids (don't have to worry about them yelling in a quiet restaurant). According to our waiter, place just opened about 3 months ago, but already very popular. Some dishes are a little pricey, but not as bad as eating at some of the main Strip hotel restaurants. Worth trying!
