oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ We stayed at the Linq so naturally came looking for food in the hotel. This place was a disappointment. I got the chicken burrito. They were stuffed with shredded chicken but so much so you couldn't enjoy the other ingredients. The meat also had no taste. It wasn't seasoned well at all and for a Mexican restaurant that's disappointing. My boyfriend had the enchiladas and had the same problem. Solution here - less unseasoned meat and more fresh ingredients.
