Z1yvzAbs4fGC28s7WtUonA So I had not eaten here in a while and I was craving  fish tacos so I decided to stop in. They seem to be under new ownership which allows them to branch out to other states so the name has changed slightly. No complaints about service or the food. My complaint is when you check in, there is a freebie for a brownie if you purchase a drink. Well, everyone knows how much the cell service sucks at DTS, so I was not able to check in till I sat down and could find some bars on my phone. I walked up to redeem my freebie and was told "no, that I could not redeem" I was like what???? The guy was like, you needed to show that when you were paying for your food. Duh! I would have if the damn mall had cell service!! Needless to say, they have lost a star in my book and I may never return at this point. No appreciation for Yelpers at this place.....
