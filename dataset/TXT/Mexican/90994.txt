DYnFGGYU3SkrKT_G4djpYQ Let me just start this review off with I'm NOT a fan of Mexican food, and my significant other will barely tolerate Chipotle. We stumbled upon this place after going to the pool at Valley Ho. We were starving and the food at the hotel was not cutting it. We walk up and there is a little sandwich board sign with all of the day's specials including a chorizo breakfast burrito for $4. SOLD. 

Environment: Inside is small and quaint but the outdoor patio is absolutely charming. We stayed inside since it was the middle of summer but we've gone back in cooler weather and it was so relaxing outside. 

Food: Carne asada taco, Al pastor burrito, Chorizo breakfast burrito were all delicious. This place has some of the freshest and healthiest mexican fast food in town with reasonable prices. The ingredients tasted fresh and it didn't look like I was going to get Salmonella just by sitting down. They had horchata, tamarind and hibiscus drinks. I've only tried the Hibiscus and it was a little too sugary for me but then again McD's sweet tea hurts my teeth. 

One of my friends got up and ordered 3 times,  the food was that good. The portions are on the smaller side but then again the prices are so cheap you can afford to order 2 or 3 entree items for under $10. I definitely wish they were open late so I could come here instead of going to Gus' or Philly Cheesesteak. f I want Mexican, this is the place I go.
