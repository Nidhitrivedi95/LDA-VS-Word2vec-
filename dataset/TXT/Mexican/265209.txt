Wcw-xq_c89e4AaRsUtkaLw This is the second time I have been here, this time just for drinks. They have a fabulous selection of tequila and served in different volumes so you can try truly excellent tequila at an affordable price. Our server was super helpful and nice to chat with. I keep meaning to get here for brunch (last dinner was excellent) - one day we'll make it!
