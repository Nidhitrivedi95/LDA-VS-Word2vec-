BEplfZTUzYwApjMUaOA12w Reserved a table for Friday night for 8 people. The house was pretty full but the noise level was not too bad. We had seating on the patio, but because we were on the far end near the shops I almost wish we had just taken a table inside because you couldn't see the water anyway. Just something to consider when you have a large guest- you will not be right by the water. 

The food is not good enough to make me want to come back and I think more than a few people were a little disappointed in their dishes. I will say though that if you are looking for a spot that does Mexican dishes a little differently, with a creative twist, this might be your place. 

I will mention that the hosts were very friendly but our main serve did not make me feel comfortable.
