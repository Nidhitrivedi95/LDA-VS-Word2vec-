WPkRg0eaJZFbyXm0uNb1ZA Horrible experience.  Chips came out stale and we asked for a replacement.  Still came out stale.  Waitress never refilled our drinks or checked on us after the food came out.  Completely unacceptable.  I looked up and saw the waitress sitting down with a colleague.  This would be fine if she had checked on us or filled our drinks.  The complete lack of service is unacceptable and very disappointing.  The actual entrees were just OK, nothing to write home about.  Never coming back here again.  Definitely would not recommend to anyone.
