frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A I'm visiting from San Diego where we have the best Mexican food . The menu , I didn't really get so I ordered the soup which was great ! A little bit of direction on where to order would be good . The line was long the people in front of me didn't know where to order, they just passed me a menu . I stood in line hoping that that was what I was supposed to be doing . My star rating is for the salsa bar , I'm very impressed. It's hard to find places that offer a hot salsa
