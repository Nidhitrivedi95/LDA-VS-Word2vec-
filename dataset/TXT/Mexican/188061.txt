o5Mofj5KJkYAMs_fhxftpg I came in during their grand opening and it seemed like it was decently busy. I got two tacos, one chicken and one pork and while they were much better than Spoon House's the overall experience was just ok. It was nothing particularly special. Granted. they'll probably get much better as they get into the swing of things. 

Quality: 4/5
The meat was good quality and the ingredients looked pretty fresh. Also the presentation was pretty. :) That being said, stay away from the chicken, it's watery so it makes the tortilla break down and you end up with a mess on your hands. 

Value: 2.5/5
Kind of expensive, but then again so are most Korean fusion places. I think the tacos are worth it, but the bowl and burritos really aren't cause you're paying a ton for basically rice+some other stuff.

Ambiance: 2/5
I think this is their weakest point. Maybe they don't really want to be a sit down place but the inside looked kind of dingy and dusty. Their decorations looked pretty shabby as well. I'd recommend just getting something to go and then just going across the street to Latea or something and eating there.

Service: 4/5
The staff was friendly and service was fast. Someone even came over to see how our meal was.

Taste: 3.5/5
It tasted alright; there was too much rice for my liking and it seemed like some orders were too covered in lettuce.
