If you like food and like not being broke:
Bingo. Stop looking anywhere else. Don't bother reading any other reviews.
Eat here.
Then sit in Starbucks across the lot while you digest for a few hours. That's what I had to do after I destroyed a chimichanga. 
You'll be that full for under $10. And it won't taste like cardboard and spice.
Now I may be a white boy, but I love me some legit Mexican food. This is the place for gringos or otherwise.
Also, I sat around for a while after finishing eating to watch Jurassic World. Yeah, they play legit movies. Pretty cool addition.
