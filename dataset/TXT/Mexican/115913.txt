GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog Stayed in Cosmo so just walked in for easy dinner.  Seating kind of holds the customers in contempt.  Barbacoa taco was really good.  Guacamole was pretty good.  Dumplings were so-so.  Had a michelada beer and it was rough.  Had a few other tacos and they were just passable.  Not bad if it's convenient.  Service was very good.  Prices were high for what it was, but probably cheaper than just about every other sit down dining experience in the Cosmo.
