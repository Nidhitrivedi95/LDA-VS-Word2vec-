ST66dWiUqYnvrD7zT4QBNw We thoroughly enjoyed our food from Rito's. We both ordered green chile burritos (regular style). They ran out of red chile before 4pm which is why I docked a star - I really wanted to try the red chile. Maybe next time! The rice and beans are astounding - probably the best I've ever had. The owner is very nice and helpful. I would recommend taking the food to go as the restaurant is on the smaller side.
