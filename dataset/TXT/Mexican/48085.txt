89uU51kOiQXbJHVA3C6XMQ Decent food, decent prices the decor reminds me of a authentic Mexican hole in the wall. Honestly I'm not sure what the hype is for this place. Non of the food is what I'd call better than mediocre. With all the tasty Mexican food options here in Phoenix I don't know why people rave about this place.
