WGkqfp1-3130v8xhCb3APg I can't speak to the quality of the food, as I've only had a drink (with a girlfriend, NO KIDS!) at Taco Tontos. But the drink (blackberry margarita) was delicious and HUGE. It would have been even better frozen, but they didn't do that. No matter.

It is very small inside, and had we not come at an off time (Saturday at around 6ish) it probably would have been really crowded and we wouldn't have been able to get a seat at the bar.

But something just feels a little unfinished about the place. I shall return to eat and then update my review.
