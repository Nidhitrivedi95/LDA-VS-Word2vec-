db12Hn9hdoE-Ne4_NsVKSw I LOVE this place. I wish that it were closer to me. Please open a location in West Valley. So, I have been frequenting the Thai spot right behind her for at least 2 years and for as long as I remember I have driven right past this place. Well one day, me and my husband were extra hungry and while we were waiting for our order at the Thai place we decided to order two tacos. They were AMAZING. The next weekend we drove to Tempe and sat inside for date night and order almost one of everything and shared. The queso is amazing! Churros are always warms and fresh. I now always order the drunken steak burrito and my husband usually gets one of the chicken burritos. We use to do the combo that comes with a taco and burrito but by the time we add the order of churros that come with two we are so full we usually have left overs. Anyway, this place is totally worth driving from Avondale for. We make special trips to or try to find reasons to be close by so we can be here for lunch or dinner.
