get it! Chicken gordita. This is SO good. Think a traditional taco, but fried tortilla. and a little "fatter". 

Chicken taco - mexicano (cilantro + onion) - still a little bland (the chicken needs "something" in it).

Small space but they have 12 4-person tables. Bigger than expected. They have Jarritos and Victoria beer. 

Free chips and salsa - the mild is mild and the spicy is medium. Both very GREAT flavors.
