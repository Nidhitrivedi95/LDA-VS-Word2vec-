2qIZlW8YSLL8a7I6KkJdHQ I wanted to try this place due to the Great reviews on Yelp. My overall experience felt like I was dining in someone's kitchen getting microwaved lukewarm leftovers. I wanted to like this restaurant. It is conveniently located and seems to have a following. I may have come on an off day. I hope their posole is great.
I have to admit that the cigarette smoke coming from Lola's is a turn off.
