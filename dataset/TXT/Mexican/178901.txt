mz1zD5_eqyCQNuzAqB_iKg Great options for vegans, as well as non-vegans! Took my boyfriend here the other day and he had the loaded nachos, while I had the vegan molletes. Will definitely be coming back to try the vegan desserts and other items on the menu! Prices were moderate and we also had a great, accommodating waitress.
