MVSACvnnpDiEDp4FTn1c5A Ok so with this one i had to take a picture. and so everyone knows I like chipotle for some fast food that is normally fresh , well my family and i made our orders but when i got to the guacamole I had to question the server, and explain that I didnt want brown guacamole, he stirred it up and started to say it was fine I explained if i had it at my house I would throw it out and start over , at this point a Lady off to the side chimed in and said that they received the avocados today and it was made fresh today! I explained again I still would throw it especially after he mixed all it all up & there wasn't even Green on the bottom side .On top of that it was 9 at night so how fresh was it?  we chose to skip avocado except my mom and daughter by the way they both stopped eating there food and didnt finish, what a waste and such poor customer service on the server and the Lady talking from across the kitchen I'll just assume how she chimed in with no intro deduction or even the courtesy to walk over to us instead of speaking across the kitchen that she was the Manager.  so really chipotle? with all the problems you've had with food saftey this is what your going to put out with service and product? poor example of how to run a successful and inviting restaurant. I'll be also forwarding my comments to corporate because one of my biggest customers owns two chipotles and i know she would never accept this !! and as a customer neither should we.
