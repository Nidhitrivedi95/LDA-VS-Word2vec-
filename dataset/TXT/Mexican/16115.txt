1BvWaR-5EcODm59zRmNKkQ This is a good place for after/before the movies. The Strawberry raspado is not good. It tastes like watered down jelly. Also, why they charge extra for lechera really bothers me. We really like the churros locos here BUT they are not real CHURROS they are CHURROMAIS the chips. But they still taste good just not original.
