_u1Bq7QsgMUXSMex8QHqLQ Probably the best burrito that you can find in the city! Chipotle and Chino Locos don't even hold a candle to this place. My favorite is a chicken/steak hybrid burrito on a whole wheat tortilla with extra guacamole. All the fresh ingredients just flow so well together, which end up making my mouth water while waiting for my order.
