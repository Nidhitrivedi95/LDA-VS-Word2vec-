oxv2UyI5yF6yawPU20tOxA Came here for a work event with a bunch of co- workers. They gave us a prix fixe menu to pick food from. 

Everyone got the house salad, it was pretty average. They had chips and salsa on the table when we got there- decent. 

We got to pick between chicken, filet, and ribs. I picked the filet- it was juicy but still kind of tough to chew. My co- worker got the ribs and they were huge- huge stack. The food was average overall but they gave a huge quantity of it.

They also brought out their house made tortilla with butter. 

Service was really good but food was just average.  I wasn't super impressed by any of the items I consumed. Margaritas were pretty sugary.
