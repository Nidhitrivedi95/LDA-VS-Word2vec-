RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg So good very authentic Tj food.. They don't let you sit down until you have your food which is good thing because there is no saved seating.... And there is always a table regardless...  And there is no longer patio seating...The hours on weekend are earlier they open at 9:00am... Loved it it's a must every time we are in Vegas
