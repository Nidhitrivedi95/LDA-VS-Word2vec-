5ts_r4K6y103zNXt0k6nEg i use to love this place. food wasn't great, but it was good. last 3 times, service has been horrible. last 2 times, i had to have the hostess hunt down our server. both times the server disappeared after taking the order and never saw him/her again. someone else brought out food. when done eating, we just waited and waited until i had to go up front to ask them to find the server.  they apologized, but didn't seem like the manager cared. AT ALL. what a shame. good chips and hot sauce. but, bad service makes that all not worth the trouble. service use to be good. don't know what happened but after 3 trips in a row, i can only assume that is how they operate now.
