tCkd8eAx2mR0oioQcqkxPw Welp, I used to think you couldn't ruin tacos, and then I ate at Mucho Macho Taco. We had the pastor, the carne asada, the Joe's Crispy, and the grilled vegetable and hummus, and a side of refried beans. I have never tasted tacos so bland and flavorless in my life! No seasoning, no heat, no nothing! Even the textures were off-putting. I thought "well, I guess I'll drown these in salsa to give them some taste," but no, even the salsa lacked flavor. The "hot" salsa basically tasted like tobasco sauce. The only flavor gleaned from the beads was from the cheese on top. The orange Bang was the only bright spot. Hard pass.
