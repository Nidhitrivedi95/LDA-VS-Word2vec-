They were wonderful, it was like a real street taco. Everything your looking for a soft, cheesy corn tortilla filled with beans, meat and all the yummy fixins. I will say I am a meat snob, I loved the carne asada. It was tender and had a real savory flavor...secret recipe?? It was really great.  It was so yummy I am taking the kids over today, so we can be a paying customer.
