-NjZ5HZApXjRJaTVZeSO_w Love the pupusas here. Two will fill you up. They are super hot coming out so be careful! The staff doesn't speak much English, but they speak more English than I speak Spanish so it's all good. The curtido is refreshing and crunchy, though the hot sauce isn't hot. Not a deal breaker for me. 

Get there early though. The hours say they are open until 8pm but they locked the doors at 7:30. LOL
