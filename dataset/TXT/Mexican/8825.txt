_u1Bq7QsgMUXSMex8QHqLQ For a place named Burrito Boyz, I was quite surprised that everyone working there was a female.

Anyhoo,

Lemme give you the shimmy. 

Came here on a friday night, around 2.30am. GOt myself a small steak burrito. Everything on it. No need to fuss. It was 2.30am. Got home around 3.45am. It was then that I finally had the chance to nom it.

WHAT ARE YOU? 

This was hands down the best burrtio of my life. SO many magical flavours. So much meat. SO much cheese. 

DROOL. 

Woke up with bits of burrito all over my face.



THEN

I went back. Sunday Night.

2am again.

GOT A MIX.

Chicken + Shrimp. Extra Jalaps. 8 dollars. Large.

This is a lie right? HOW CAN IT BE SO CHEAP?!?!

THE SHRIMP WERE LARGE AND IN CHARGE.

THE CHICKEN for DE.LI.CIOUS.

Mouth = on fire.

I want to go back every day. Every year. Every forever.


LOVE YOU BURRITO BOYS.

Can I marry one of you? 

Also, I shuld add like 6 extra stars for a 90's Backstreet Boys dance-down that happened with my friends + the ..burrito girls?
