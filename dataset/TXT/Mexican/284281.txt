xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw Actually came only for desert. We shared a butter, cinnamom, sugar fry bread and a honey fry bread. We asked for coffee, but (at 2PM) the pot had been time and tasted like it. Should have told us it was old or offered to make a fresh pot. It did have the most robust menu of any Indian Fry Bread Place I've been to. The restaurant is too big, was obviously something else before and is not in good repair, but it is clean. Fast Casual dining (order at counter/delivered to table) Service was fast  Food was fresh and good, other than coffee noted above. I will return.
