LhU-XsZ2YObJnP-5uiMIjA Catering experience. Phenomenal service and food all around, I have no criticisms

Habanero's came to our event, in which I was a guest, with many Sterno chaffing dishes filled with wonder. There was chicken and pork, rice, black and refried beans, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, limes, guacamole, cheese, cheese sauce, sour cream. There were three types of salsa ranging from fresh pico de gallo to a fresh green salsa with heat to a very hot, smoky deep red salsa that did make me blow my nose. Chips, flour tortillas, corn tortillas were offered, wrapped in foil to stay warm.

Staff was very friendly, greeted each person but moved swiftly and I waited nearly no time. I observed them aptly answering allergy related questions of others with confidence. Food was quite hot, tasted extremely fresh. Staff served the food in large servings on the plate for you, custom to order (think Qdoba, pero autentico). One could order anything, everything, or minimally. I, of course, got everything and enjoyed every last bit of it.

I will absolutely use Habanero's if I am ever trusted with the responsibility of arranging the catering for an event. I cannot believe their parking lot isn't packed with lines out the drive through (unsure if that's actually in operation). I know I will be a return customer.
