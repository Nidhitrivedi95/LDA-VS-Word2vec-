C2BR0TjNacoNzItPLUHTAA Every bit as delicious as Coconuts Maui!  Loved the fish tacos!!  Enjoyed the Coconut shrimp and fries were also good.  Longboard beer to make you feel like you're on the island.  
Scottsdale owner stopped by to ask about quality of food and service and was happy to take our input.  
We had stumbled upon Coconuts in Kihei (Maui) just a week prior and thought the food was terrific.  So happy to have this new taste of paradise situated only a couple of miles from home.
Highly recommended.
