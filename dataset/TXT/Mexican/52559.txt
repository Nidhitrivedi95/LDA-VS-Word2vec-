9Jc3W0aR9Xf2gcHI0rEXsw I occasionally attend a stamp show at circus circus and like to catch a beer here after walking around.  The beers are cheap.  Yesterday I tried the wings for the first time and they are very tasty.  My buddy and I ordered parmesan garlic, hickory, and buffalo and they were very decent wings at $1 a piece.

Not a bad place to catch a beer and some okay bar food and stay out of the kiddies way.
