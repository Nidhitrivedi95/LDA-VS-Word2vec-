NuExoRpRNRsVgRyF_E5Zhw Went there today because its .99 cent beef and chicken Taco Tuesday all day. When I looked at their daily specials they also listed $4.99 two beef tacos and a drink for Tuesday! That doesn't even make sense. Why even bother having a special like that?! Perhaps the 4.99 deal comes with better meat and the overcooked scraps are used on the .99 cent orders because thats what it tasted like. After finishing my meal my stomach starting turning a little.
