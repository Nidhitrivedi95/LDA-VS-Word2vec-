CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q Our favorite taco place in Vegas! Friends tried the one by The Strip but they said it's not the same so we always go to this location.  We've been pretty lucky and haven't had to wait long (max 10 min). But we're usually here past 1AM.

They have their own parking area but since they are in a plaza, there's also plenty of parking nearby as well. They do have a few tables outside towards the back if all the tables inside are taken. Usually pretty cold inside as well, so bring a jacket at night!

When you enter, you pick up a tray if you are ordering a bunch of different items and then stand in line one of 3 lines for the type of meat you want. If you want a different meat in another line,  then you'll have to go to that other line as well (or have a friend grab it for you). When you got all your items, you pay at the cashier. By the drinks is where you can find the limes & radishes.

My favorite is the lengua (beef tongue) and cabeza (beef head) tacos. WARNING: If you order the cabeza tacos, they do have a spicy sauce that goes with it so if you don't do spicy foods well, be sure not to get it. I like to wash everything down with a horchata. My friends always order the al pastor and carne asada. Meats are tender and always delicious.

Afterwards, don't forget to take away your trash so other people can use the table right away. This place is ALWAYS busy!

NEVER a Vegas trip without a stop here!
