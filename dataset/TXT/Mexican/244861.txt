tmKr2Vvu6I0zJ6kjrS949w I like this place a whole lot, but the wait time is pretty bad because of the owners' inability to find capable staff.  They have 2 locations and this is the second of the 2....almost an after thought.  The hours are also a big concern because they were open for lunch and now only open after 4pm.  The food here is delicious and the owner is super nice....and the prices are appropriate for the quality of food.  I hope that this location makes it...would be sad to see it go away.
