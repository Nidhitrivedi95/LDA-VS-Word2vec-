4CE_jyoNwSYkorer13G5OQ My friend and I religiously go to this restaurant every week because we are both obsessed with mexican food and this is definitely the closest thing to authentic you'll find in the whole city. The staff is always very pleasant and attentive and the food is always amazing. We used to go to Emiliano's before this place opened, but the food and prices at El Toro Loco are significantly better. Give it a try!
