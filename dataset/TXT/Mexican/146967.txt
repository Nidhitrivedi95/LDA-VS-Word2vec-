JMwwxARF34aR1aq7hzpiJQ This place is not far from the house at all so I decided to give it a try. 

Off the bat, You should order your food or be prepared to wait. Fresh pupusas are always well worth the wait though. Don't touch the bottom of your bag because they will be burning hot!

I got the cheese, bean and cheese, cheese and herb, chicken and cheese and cheese and zucchini. All very good. The Curtido I felt like could be a little big more flavorful but for 1.95 a pupusa, its pretty good.
