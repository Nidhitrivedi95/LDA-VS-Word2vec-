HU8MnV129kOK4m0ZH4GpCg Went in around 9 PM on a Tuesday night. Was quickly greeted and seated. The staff were laid back and friendly. We ordered the guacamole and two orders of the 3 for $10 tacos (fish, shrimp & calamari) considering it was Taco Tuesday. Guacamole was made fresh at our table and the chips were seasoned perfectly. The tacos did take a while to come out; however, they were completely worth the wait. Probably the best tacos offered in the Mississauga area. 

Will definitely be returning to try the other items on the menu.
