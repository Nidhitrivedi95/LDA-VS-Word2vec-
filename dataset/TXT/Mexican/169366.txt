lWmDrnqgU6w3gFaJyn_1Uw What can I say? Having studied abroad in southern Spain for a semester in college, Radio Maria's Spanish flare and tapas menu really pluck at a heartstring with me. I love enjoying late afternoon tapas on a warm summer day with great drinks and better friends. 

I'm not forgetting the great selection of entrees this restaurant/bar offers, but in typical Spanish fashion, I usually fill up on beer and tapas before I can even contemplate dinner. While they don't serve dinner all night long, they do continue serving their most popular tapas until close. 

So grab a group of friends and head over to Radio Maria soon; the availability of food at all hours makes it a great place to start or end a night downtown!
