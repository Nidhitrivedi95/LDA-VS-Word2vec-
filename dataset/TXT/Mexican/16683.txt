1fMXFNFwZEtTy9p8sEmiNw I try to avoid writing reviews for businesses and food joints that aren't local, but I feel as if this Taco Bell location deserves its praises. 

First of all, I'm a fan of Taco Bell over other fast food because I'm a vegetarian. Taco Bell has a TON of options for vegetarians. My favorite is the potato taco. This location is particularly accommodating to my veggie needs. I can get extra vegetables at no extra cost, beans instead of beef, rice added, potatoes instead of something and no bacon or other meats on foods I may want. They will do anything for me, and that makes me really happy.

Another point to make is that this location has THE BEST staff. Everyone is always so nice to me and my boyfriend, they make conversation and fix any mistakes made very promptly. In fact, there are rarely mistakes at all. This also makes me happy, because fast-food workers tend to be overworked and underappreciated, and this leads to grumpiness! 

The store is typically clean, and it is also one of the only places open late in Forest Hills. It is in a convenient location to where I live, and that makes it all so appealing for those late nights coming home. 

I'm not a big fan of fast food, but I would definitely like to stress that this particular store is simply astounding. The employees certainly deserve the praise, and I hope to continue to see the store improve and offer yummy options for when I'm on a super-duper budget.
