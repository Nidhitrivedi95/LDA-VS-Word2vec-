r8hF3kwnZzxTo1IYNcI6rg What a gem! We came in very early for dinner after attending Big Band Saturday at the DeCar Events Center down the street (see review).
Little white stucco building that can easily be missed.  Proves looks can be deceiving as you're surprised how cute and quaint the place is decorated.
Sangria was great (white&red), chips homemade, salsa yum! Guac on point!
The parradilla platter w/chorizo, chicken and carne was good but next time I'm stepping up the $10 for the rib eye and prime rib selection. Beans and rice tasty-and the cream corn was unique (in a good way).
Coming next time after a Smith Center outing or just with the girls to suck down Sangria. 
Recommend!!
