0jAexNHRHhkQv4zNYqenBA The service here is absolutely horrendous. We went for taco Tuesday and ended up regretting that we went. We were sat and the server came over to get our drink order, which was probably the only good thing of the night. My boyfriend got his beer, but I didn't get my water. We didn't see our server....or any other server.....for some time. We were ready to get up and just leave, but instead I asked a food runner to grab our server who we hadn't seen. A different server came over to take our order and finally bring me water after having to request it again. We got our food and aside from a manager checking on us as we both had our mouths full, nobody very stopped by our table again. We never received the check.....I had to ask for it after having waiting for far too long. I continued to see our original server not working the entire night. She was either flirting with a table of guys across from us or hugging and hanging out with a guy right in front of us at the bar. I understand these girls are young and working in a bar tends to include flirting.....but do your job. Make sure your guests are being taken care of. It was completely unprofessional and I won't be going back because it took over an hour to eat dinner when it should have only taken about 30 minutes. I almost didn't tip, but the server who ended up taking over most things was running around to other tables, so I didn't want to leave her nothing. She also wasn't attentive, but she at least helped us out some and was actually doing work related things. The good definitely isn't good enough to try and put up with such terrible service.
