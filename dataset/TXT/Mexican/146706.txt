JlNeaOymdVbE6_bubqjohg Poor packaging. We got menudo by the time we got back home which is just around the corner. It was so hot it melted the Styrofoam cup it was in and spilled every where. Burn on the top of my foot and ruined my Jordan slippers. Mind you this was our first time eating here. Going back is questionable
