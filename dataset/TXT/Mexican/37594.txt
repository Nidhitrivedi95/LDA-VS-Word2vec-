5ts_r4K6y103zNXt0k6nEg I honestly have never had such a horrible experience in my life... I expect dinner time to be busy at any restaurant but this was complete neglect of service. The short 20 minuet waif wasn't bad but we were seated and our orders were taken with in a few minutes. I was with my friend and her three children, aged 7, 3 and 15 months which in itself can make dinner out stressful. We ordered a cheese crisp as an appetizer and told the waitress we'd like it out first. Again I understand a dinner rush but this was beyond that! 50 mins went by with out food or acknowledgement, finally we ask her about our food and she says she will go check on it and let us know. Another 15 mins go by without her ever coming back to us. By this time the kids are starving and done waiting... crying and interrupting the dinner of those around us. Coloring is no longer an option and they are over chips by now. We decide to just leave and tell the hostess to please let our serve know since she's no where to be found. The manager approaches us saying she will get our food right out but we politely decline. At this point our appetite is gone and the kids will no longer sit. She then tells us she will get us a gift certificate, walks away and doesn't come back... at this point we just left. I used to love this place and have been craving it but after the experience I had I don't think I'll be returning. I wish I could give zero stars.
