7Q2cYSl5NBYytJzgjX0oKw Went here for the first time, with a large group of work colleagues.  Overall the experience was okay.  In hindsight probably not the best place for a large group, as the Sandbar is noisy and crowded.  Took quite a while to wait for enough tables to open up for our group.

However, for what the Sandbar is, it does well.  It is meant to be a festive, noisy, party atmosphere, with the ambiance of a beach bar in some tropical locale. While our group was waiting to get seated, we stood around the bar and had no issues getting prompt service on our drink orders from the bartender.  And then after we got our tables, our waitress took good care of us.  No long waits for drink refills, and the food orders were correct and prompt.

The food itself was average.  Not great, not bad.  Seemed fair for the prices.  And there were a lot of happy hour and daily specials to choose from.  

This Sandbar is located in the Desert Ridge mall, right off the 101.  So there is plenty of parking in the mall, no worries there.

If you are looking for somewhere quiet, or intimate, you should probably skip this place.  But if you are in the mood to party, this seems a good place.
