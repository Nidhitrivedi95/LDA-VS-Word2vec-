O_UC_izJXcAmkm6HlEyGSA Went for my sister's birthday with a group of her friends, note: this is not a place for large group (ie. anything more than 2 people).

The food was good.  Fresh ingredients, good size portions, flavourful, simple and made with love.

The service was attentive, polite and helpful.

This is a tequila bar, so don't expect a wide selection of scotch or vodka.  Their cocktails are creative and bring out the different tequila flavours. 

The space is where they lack and the "intimate" setting just gets annoying.   Because of proximity to everything else in the restaurant, it gets loud and it was hard to maneuver around especially since there was a group of us.  So if you're claustrophobic, wait till you get a seat on the patio. 

Also, it's a bit pricey, but affordable considering the area.  It's about $8 for a plentiful side of guacamole and chips and $13 for tacos.  Which as I'll say again and again in my review of taco places- is too much for street food. 

Parking is difficult, street parking only, but the subway is about 2 blocks away.
