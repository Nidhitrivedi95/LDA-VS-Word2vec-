FI7RsrAxVdiDEuSKlYql1w We visited here last night from out of town. We had a party of 8, and we're seated immediately, which rarely happens anywhere. The restaurant was very busy, it was apparent it's a good spot. Our food was great, absolutely great. My only complaint would be that the chips aren't freshly made, which is a common thing where we live in Tennessee. We had margaritas, which were decent, as well. Our bill total was surprisingly good for 8 adults. Overall, we left very happy!
