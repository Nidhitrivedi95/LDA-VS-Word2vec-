eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg We had a large party (9) and knew it was a smaller place so we got there at 5:15 on a weekday.  We were told it would be an hour and that didn't seem unreasonable and since it was a nice day we sat out on the small patio and enjoyed some drinks and conversation.  Our table was ready and our expectations high.  Service was not fast but our waitress was friendly enough.  We ordered a double order of the famous guac and lets just say it was ok.  If you like super chunky avocado "dip" with pomegranate seeds this is for you.  It was interesting but to be honest we were so hungry after 90 minutes we all chowed down.  We ordered entrees and waited another 30-40 mins.  Now we were ready for some of this highly touted award winning chef food.  Let's just say we were all pretty much let down.  Food was not flavorful and didn't even seem all that fresh.  I've had better Mexican in the Midwest.  The menu was interesting and I'm hoping we just caught a bad night but I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon.
