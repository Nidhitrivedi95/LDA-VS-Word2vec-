hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg This was probably one of the best dining experiences I ever had. What a fun, totally unpretentious place. The service was amazing, the food totally original and incredibly delicious... it was the kind of delicious that my wife and I took our first bite of our first dish at the same time and looked at each other wide eyed with disbelief and absolute pleasure. Without question, one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. If you like fun and delicious things, this is the place for you!
