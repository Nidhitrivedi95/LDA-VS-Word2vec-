UUfioP3G4Qowm0x2HQlPtA I work next door so i eat here very often. I usually get the chicken quesadilla which is a good size so I'll eat half for lunch & half for dinner. I love most of their sauces & even taste great with plain ol sour cream. I've had the chicken bowl also. The brown rice is a lil crunchy but still good. Staff is super nice! If you need help ordering, just ask! I'm really suprised at the not so good reviews this place has gotten cause I've always gotten great food & great service. They are new so if you aren't happy, tell em! I'm sure they'll make it right.
