NUQrKfOH6477lHG4xwhBxA Possibly the worst Taco Bell I have ever been to in my life. I have been here multiple times, just for the fact it is 2 minutes from my house and it's open later than the one on snow. Every single time I come to this Taco Bell the mess up my food in some sort of way. Tonight's trip consisted of 2 double stack tacos, 2 cheesy potatoes, and a cheesy Gordita crunch. Everything without sour cream. At first I thought everything was good until I opened and tried to eat the nacho crunch Taco. This should not have sour cream on it but for some reason they decided to put it on it. I'm very disappointed in this Taco Bell because naturally it seems as if they fuck everything up. I'm not sure if it's because all of the workers are too stoned out of they're mind to read a screen correctly or if they're just fucking stupid. Save yourself some irritation and just go to the pearl road Taco Bell or snow road Taco Bell
