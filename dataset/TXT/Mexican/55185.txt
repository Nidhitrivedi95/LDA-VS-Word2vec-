9wm8Q1W_0_7Ka_AWBK5c7Q Let me preface this post by saying they are new and I hate going to new places too quickly because they have to iron out all the kinks, and I understand that; so I'm going to go easy on these guys. 
They are in a previous location held by the old Clarks' bar and grill, so you can still feel that Irish pub ghost. They have tried to add a Mexican flavor as best they can. Not bad... clean modern bar, nice atmosphere. Glassware was perfect, that south of the border blown glass look. Bartender friendly but overwhelmed, couldn't keep up. She did her best though, and I think everyone ordering a frozen blended drink didn't help. Food was nice, how can you screw up fajitas?!?  Rice not bad. Beans not bad. Guacamole was on point. Everything was a solid 4 outta 5. Chips and salsa hit the spot. Nothing to buckle your knees, but delish enough for another trip back. Price points for middle of hidden suburbia.... too high. Probably do better dropping slightly. And this place is definitely hidden, Magellan would have a hard time discovering this spot. 
Service needs work but... again... we already discussed being brand new, they'll get it under control. I'll be back with an updated review!
