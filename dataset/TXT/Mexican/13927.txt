0qOI8lOZvvhrbtxqjaBQMg After taking a spin class, we were starving and we see Los Favoritos! I ordered carne asada and adobada tacos with chips and salsa. The restaurant is small, but we didn't mind too much. 

The tacos were a generous portion and satisfied me. The salsa they gave us was really good - it tasted homemade and it wasn't your typical tomatoes, cilantro, red onion like mix. I really enjoyed it. 

The bill was inexpensive: around $15.
