PBR-ptw8xK_uaYzhm0JHJQ Lunch menu is decent, nothing to write home about. Not the cheapest regular prices though. The service is fast and very professional. Ordered the lunch fajitas half chicken half steak and they were out of steak but the server was very apologetic.  The chicken was delicious. All ingrediants we fresh and guacamole was homemade and fresh as well. I'll definetly be returning.
