qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A Whenever I am in Vegas next; hopefully sooner than later, I don't care if I have to pay a taxi from my hotel to take me here...I'M GOING! This place was fantastic. We made a reservation for brunch on a Saturday for six of us, although two people in our party were running late. Even though they were pretty crowded they cordially let us sit down and didn't make us wait until our whole party was there. About a minute after being seated we were greeted by one of the most cheerful waiters I have ever encountered--I forget his name but he has red hair--and offered us some drinks to start with while we wait for our friends. I have two words for you : JAMAICAN MOJITO. You may want to wait a bit before driving after this one but WOW. 

Our friends ended up taking a little longer than we expected but our server showed absolutely no frustration or rush for us to order. I'm usually a faithful eggs benedict bruncher, however I ended up going with the jerk chicken and waffles. Well, as soon as it arrived I knew I would not be leaving hungry...it was HUGE. But it ended up being great because the others at my table realized how delicious it was and had some bites! The syrup is sooo deliciously flavored and it's the perfect combo between sweet and savory. We were so mesmerized by our meals that even though we were stuffed we couldn't help but order desert! (Only one for the table though). Can't wait to come back, maybe even for dinner! Nice bright, sunny and welcoming atmosphere for brunch though.
