VBVqHnViRLSYAqP7v8iNNQ Nice restaurant!  We were pleasantly surprised to say the least.  I usually can't polish off a 2 taco plate with rice and beans but man this one disappeared very quickly!  My wife had the cheese enchilada and green chile corn tamales...she loved it too.  The big surprise was the margarita!  It was excellentay!  Very delicious and packed a punch!  Its nice to see a restaurant that doesn't try to screw you on the drinks.  Service was also very good.  We stopped by again and the food, service is excellent!  This definitely my new favorite Mexican restaurant.  Highly recommended.  Dont screw up and miss out!
