M8S7poDhCIzqQx1--GB-ww Absolutely delightful. The restaurant has great ambiance, friendly service, and a beautiful patio. To top it off the food was perfect for a mid-sized lunch with just a little something special. We had the grilled fish plate, it was fresh and satisfying, especially the pineapple salsa with cilantro. The shrimp was very good. Highlight was the key like pie served in a little mason jar - you could tell it was just made...incredible. Plus there spicy ceasars will kick you in the butt. Highly recommended, will be back!
