Zocalo is special for Cleveland, and to me, very good. It is not authentic Mexican because it has an additional exotic taste to it, that I can't put my finger on.
I ordered the combination beef enchilada and chili relleno. The enchilada was tasty with it's great sauce and cheese(s). The beef was tender and traditionally stewed and shredded. The finishing touch was the diced chives that were sprinkled on top. The relleno was wonderful as it was stuffed with a great selection of grilled veggies such as: squash, zucchini, red peppers, etc. My friend ordered the steak with a terrific spread of grilled veggies. The only thing that I did not like was the black beans as a side dish: very bland.
I can't wait to go back and taste the burrito everyone is raving about.
We happened to have a sweetheart of a server too.
