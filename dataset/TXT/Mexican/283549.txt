XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Bobby Flay would have fired his chief had he eaten the dinner I was served. My Ahi tuna was supposed to be served with a mango salsa, but instead it was served with dried mango chunks. My daughter ordered the salmon and assumed for 38 dollars it would be wild caught salmon, it was farm raised and extremely fishy. The "black beans" were a salty puree and the jalapeño butter had no spice. The tamale side dish was basically dry corn meal with no flavor and the prickly pear margaritas had zero alcohol. The only slight upside was the waiter was friendly. I would never go back.
