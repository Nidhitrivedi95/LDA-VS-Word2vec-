zCmwErM82hdKl4L2UixDJw Awesome food, awful service. Matt, the bartender, has served me a few times and he is always such a buzzkill! He seems so miserable working there - unfortunately his attitude is infectious and I never want to stay long. I have worked in the service industry many years and I know that it takes very little effort to at least pretend to have a good time. Also, his bartending skills are sub par. I'll be sitting in the dining room or ordering take out from Barrio from now on.
