cWtUKKsnEYy1WeR1aEdyMA I've had a lot of Mexican food in Toronto (and also in Mexico.) Fonda Lola's food is among the very best I've had. They have a way of taking something traditional and adding a grace and twist to it that makes it very special. we had three appies. First was the guacamole, which was a puree with fresh tacitos and the only thing we weren't crazy about. But the Hand held Cesar salad, was astonishing. The salad was rolled in lettuce topped with a slice of crispy jajapeño and eaten like a taco. The ceviche which followed it was also terrific with a sharp lime marinade to die for. We all had the pork tacos served in a hot mini-fry pan with salsa and pineapple. These tacos pastor were first-rate, as were the churros we had for dessert.
Our service was excellent, and the atmosphere friendly and funky. One thing to know is that the menu is quite small. You won't find a huge range of typical things, but what you do find will please your palate
