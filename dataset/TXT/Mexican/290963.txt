yrEhbjvGcODIH1OTVrc-IQ Great late night Mexican food! It's really nice to have a burrito boyz opening till 11 pm on weekdays.

Service is always fast here and really friendly.

The reason I didn't give 5 stars is due to the fact that their meat is sometimes very dry. I've been to other franchised locations and their steak and chicken is very moist. I find the steak and chicken here so dry that I can barely chew through it. The toppings are very fresh every time!

Hopefully the meat quality improves soon.

Overall great late night fast food restaurant for your Mexican food fix!
