RSuT0SK4XpsIAZtdP7Lf3w Great family-run place in Glendale. Crowded on a Sat afternoon. I was driving otherwise would have tried the wine margaritas. 1 liter was only $10!  Couldn't be that bad for the price. Had the red beef burro and E had the veggie tamales. We were both satisfied with the meals and price.
