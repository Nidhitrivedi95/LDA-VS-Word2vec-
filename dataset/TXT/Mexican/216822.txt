R6cWq0FkVfV_Ee-YttlPyA I ordered the asada street tacos which comes with three tacos, Spanish rice, beans, and two different salsas, one red, one green. The beans were very tasty and the rice was okay. The tacos were super, super, super tiny BUT they ARE "street tacos" so I guess I should've known better. The asada was okay. I went straight for the green salsa and poured it all over my food. I really should've tried the salsas first because the green salsa was super spicy. I had to remove what I could from my food with a napkin. My mistake. The customer service could use some help. Cashier had an attitude towards me and her coworkers. Not very professional. For airport food this place was okay. I probably won't be back.
