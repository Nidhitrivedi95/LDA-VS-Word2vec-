Iw9k29FJCZ0fC68oxK1NtA The hard shell tacos are huge - I got two, but really one and a side of guac or salsa is all you need.  The chicken is really tasty, and the sweet potato doesn't sound like it's gonna be good, but it is, trust me.  Pretty solid guacamole and chips.  Super fast service for takeout.  This place is definitely a highlight of the Kent, Ohio dining scene!
