VuYF1vGKLjEFaQfL4Ypwqg Never made it to the old Gallo Blanco, but today got to try out their food in the new location in the Garfield District. Service was good, we sat at the bar. The fresh limonada was delicious and refreshing, my son had the jamaica, that too was delicious. He had the chilaquilas, which were so super tasty. I had the Huarachi Camponada, a plate full of flavor and the presentation in itself was beautiful. My husband had the padilla dish which came with a stack of fresh corn tortillas, he was very pleased. We shared the banana cream pie and churros.
The pie was creamy, there was fresh banana slices, caramel and peanuts as a garnish on top.
Super amazing!!!  The churros were fresh and hot that came with three dipping sauces.
This cuisine has a new meaning to Mexican food!  I watched the bartender make several different drinks, that looked different from your ordinary cocktails. So far the best find in the Garfield District!
