MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA Best tacos, best ceviche, the cocktails are not stingy with alcohol. Even though it's small inside everything about this place is " go big or go home". My favourite tacos add the fish, shrimp, pork belly and cauliflower. Surprisingly the cauliflower is so flavourful you don't realize there's no meat inside. The service is good and the music is always playing good hip hop or rnb. It's a Great place to chill and eat!
