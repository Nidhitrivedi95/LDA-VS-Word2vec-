iOt7ebp4Zy-5YUjHL1rbmQ A Mexican food restaurant that actually serves real Mexican food! I AM IN HEAVEN!!! They have Birria, refried beans (the delicious kind) corn tortillas...... everything for authentic Mexican food. This new space is Gilbert is wonderful, its pretty big, nice and open and decorated really neat. They have outside seating and a huge salsa bar in the center. Everyone was really nice and our food came out super quick. This is my 3rd day in a row eating here...... I cant stop!!!! Everything is cooked on a huge grill right behind the counter and the smell is fantastic as soon as you walk in you can taste it in the air! LOL! The steak I wish they served in bigger chunks instead of the tiny bits, but it is still good and they pack the taco with meat, it has a lot of flavor. The Birria was amazing!!! Fantastic flavor! I recommend that before anything else. Get in my belly!!!! Note to self if you keep eating like this you will need to go to the gym twice a day!
