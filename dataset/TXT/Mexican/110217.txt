FVgHb9w4pnkRBV5bZYJaZA I was told it was a great place for tacos. Well unfortunately this place is disgusting! I found a hair in my asada taco and the lengua was not properly peeled. The cashier has no clue she literally dug her dirty nail in my taco looking for the hair and said "no miro el pelo" (I don't see the hair)then handed the taco back to me. There was a lady mopping with dirty smelly mop water while we were eating! It is very hot no AC only fansI do not recommend this awful place to anybody. There was a young man taking ready to eat meat in a garbage can to sell tacos outside.This place needs a health inspection!!!
