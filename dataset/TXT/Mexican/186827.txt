O_UC_izJXcAmkm6HlEyGSA A great place to visit if coming to Toronto for the first time. This place is so good they made two right down the street from each other. There both pretty small so trying to walk in wont work and calling right before you won't work either. But the people are friendly and always ask what the recommend because there are some pretty crazy good dishes! It's reasonably priced too.
