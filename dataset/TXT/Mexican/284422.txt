xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw I've been a regular visitor at the Fry Bread House at four locations over the years.  I quite like their green chili combo fry bread.  The green chili is consistently serviceable and the fry bread, excellent. 

But it is time this needs to be said: Fry Bread House, stop putting a 10"-12" fry bread on a 6" plate!

Serving a sloppy fry bread (with a knife and fork) on a piece of yellow paper on top of an undersized plate just pretty much guarantees you're going to eat some paper. 

The paper does not taste good.  Let's put an end to this game. 

I enjoy everything else, though.
