plHKBwA18aWeP-TG8DC96Q Very long wait 2.5 hrs after told would be 1.5 hrs.  We arrived at 6:30. Seated at 9. They comped us cheese dip and apologized. That was appreciated but point of going out for me is to spend relaxing time w friends w and having to bar hop in local neighborhood while waiting was frustrating. Plan ahead if you go for this type of arrangement. They are no longer BYB and do not allow guests to wait at their bar. You can order drinks while waiting in the lobby. I'm not a drinker and appetizers while waiting are not an option.  Menu is limited to tacos and sides. Cash only. What they offer is good. I would not say amazing but somewhat unique. Nice vegetarian selection. They have corn tortillas avail upon request of you are gluten free. The apple slaw very good and meatloaf taco special really interesting mix of flavors. One of our friends from NY commented atmosphere kinda like a Brooklyn skit. If you enjoy trendy place to explore may enjoy.  In the end not worth the wait for me but w right timing and plan may work for you.
