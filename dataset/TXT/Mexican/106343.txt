fkXwJHETFfJUc-gu-pyeLw I don't know why there are so many negative reviews about this chipotle, i go there very often and i personally have only had a handful of experiences where I have placed an online order and it wasn't ready when I got there, keep in mind it was during rush hour. Out of all of the times I have been there, the service has been fast and there is never a very long line like at other locations I have been to. The employees do a very good job.
