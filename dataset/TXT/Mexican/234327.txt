suQugTjSMYMIrK5fAabC_Q This used to be my favorite place to get a breakfast burrito, but now....I would rather eat cardboard because I can probably get a little more flavor out of it!!
Burrito was so BLAND!!! No TASTE! NO seasonings whatsoever. 
You have to season meat with at least salt n pepper...geez this meat tasted like....Nothing! Even the potatoes were plain. 
Never again. I will look for a place that have Taste.
