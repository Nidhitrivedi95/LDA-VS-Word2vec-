My husband ordered  grilled chicken sandwich and fries, I had the California BLT. We each had an order of fries, and I had an iced tea. A full 20 minutes after I placed the order, I observed a woman that had been waiting when I arrived go up to the cashier to cancel her order. A few minutes later, the manager sent an employee over to ask what I had ordered. Not a good sign. 

I could deal with paying $20 and waiting almost 30 minutes to get our food, if it was good. However, it was not. My husband's chicken was extremely dry and the condiments were only on about 1/3 of the bun. The bread on my sandwich was soggy. The avocado that made my BLT a California BLT was almost non-existent. Both sandwiches seemed like they were thrown together as quickly as possible, which was a disappointment after waiting so patiently for so long. 

I hate writing this review, because to me it appeared that all of the employees at Farmer Boys were working hard... But my watch, wallet and tastebuds were all disappointed with this experience. I don't expect to ever go back.
