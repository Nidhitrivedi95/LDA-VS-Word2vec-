FutUAQPBfCeTmqytfDW1pA I always expect a long line at Chipotles so I'm not going to complain about that. I did go around 1:30pm on a Thursday the line  was not as long as I thought it would be 10-15 minute wait which is not bad. The problem didn't occur until I reached the counter. The workers were extremely slow (had they not been I'm sure the wait would have been even shorter). I told the first person that my order was to go twice. Fast forward to not having enough lettuce for my salad and ending up with shredded lettuce instead. The girl that dresses up the orders was ditzy and hard of hearing and things had to be repeated several times. When I pay for my order my salad gets put in a bag and my tacos get slid across the counter and I look at them and slide them then back I did mention several times they were to go. I say these are to go, she says you want them to go? I say yes I want you to wrap them up so I can go (as I gesture towards the door). After another minute literally I get a lid and leave. I'll stick to tremont it's further away but service is worth it
