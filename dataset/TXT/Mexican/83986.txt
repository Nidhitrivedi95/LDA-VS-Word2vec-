d4qwVw4PcN-_2mK2o1Ro1g Pink Taco Margarita where have you been all my life?
Hibiscus Juice + Lime + Tequila, you naughty naughty girl!

give me more. $10 each? ok. its Vegas.

ok, ok, ok. I am calming down. take a breath. inhale. exhale.

(clears throat ) Yes, the Pink Taco Margarita is a lovely drink. The Pink Tacos were actually just ok, but I like the pink onions. You get three, and they are little, which is good because the are pretty filling. It comes with rice and beans, but I asked for a salad instead.  We all ordered the same thing and were more satisfied by the innuendo than the food. The service was ok. not memorable.  

I had to talk my boyfriend out of getting a pink taco shirt because although it is funny to those who understand that it is a bar and a pun, it comes off as really trashy to everyone else. like my mom.

by the way.....their motto is, 
"Eating Out Never Tasted So Good". ewe.
