El pollo loco, I come here for the crazy good chicken. I would not order anything else. 

Here's how I do it:
Order chicken only
Get salsa from the salsa bar. My favorite is the green avocado sauce. Pro-tip: ask for a large Dixie cup at the counter. They only have Dixie cups for ants at the salad bar.
