_ikylomPLdTgVtE0xWR_1Q I must have been desperate for Mexican food back in 2009 because there's two Mexican food joints on 35th Ave that absolutely blow Rolberto's away: Polibertos and Rolandos. The last two times I've been here, they screwed up my order (guac when I asked for no guac) and seriously undercooked the food. It was kind of gross.
