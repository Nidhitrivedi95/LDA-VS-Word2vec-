vW4aHXGRfkrsaNdNUuE1RQ My wife and I stopped in last night to give this place a try. It's a very cute little place.  Clean, attractive and very well done. The beer was cold and my wife thought her margarita was just Ok.  Service was good.  The problem was the food.  It just isn't good.  It was unimaginative and kind of bland.  Summary, nice place, great location, get a new chef.
