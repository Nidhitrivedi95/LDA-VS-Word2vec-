RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg WHAT WAS ORDERED: 2 tacos tripa, 1 carne asada mula 1 al pastor mula and carne asada fries

SERVICE: I speak spanish so service was good but I can see it might be an issue to none spanish speakers

CLEANLINESS: I truly think due to it being so busy they don't have the chance to clean as fast as they would like. Our table was dirty but we were waiting for someone to leave, someone came in to clean the table shortly after.

TASTE: BOMB!! tacos are my weakness and this place didn't disappoint.

WORTH THE PRICE?: yes! keep in mind, you are on the strip and considering how much food is in Vegas this is a great price.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Mulas all the way, it has cheese, guacamole, salsa with your meat of choice. everything you need in one bite. Out of all the meats my favorite was al pastor.

WILL I COME BACK?: Heck yes! this place is amazing!

TIPS AND NOTES: Be ready to wait, long lines! it is worth the wait but you might have to eat outside. There are no tables outside and the dining area inside is very small, so eating standing up is definitely going to happen.
