as_fyujgsdwtV56n31z-Sw Great first experience at Bombas! Our waitress was Alexis and she was fun , knew the menu and adorable! Also the general manager Tony who came from El Carnicero works there and is a great addition to the place. Keeping this short as possible I had the blackened fish (dynamite!) and the Rio Style Chicken also delish. I will be back!
