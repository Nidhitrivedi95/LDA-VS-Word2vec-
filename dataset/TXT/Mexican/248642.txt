uBGPTzye3wrxZPf54AXuFg New.  Mexican.  Great view and internal ambiance with nice location on the lake. I'm sure the start up for this place was a fortune    Food was decent.... we ordered the cheese fundido with chorizo and the catfish wrap   Service however was fair at best.  Hop, skip & a jump from the Rock &Roll Hall of Hame. Had to ask for chips 20 minutes after ordering my meal at the bar.  Let me repeat that... We had to ASK for tortilla chips at a Mexican restaurant. And it seemed to be a surprise that we were asking to the fella behind the bar. Strike one.  2 separate communication issues with the same forgetful bartender, who may possibly have been a bar manager as well.  Strike two   A very sweet female bartender had to make up for this guys shortcomings on a couple of occasions. It turned into a stressful lunch unnecessarily. Based on that, my recommendation is for you to walk a little further and go elsewhere.  Bar staff was very involved in a lot of technical stuff behind the bar while forgetting to take care of the reason that they are there... Us.  Keep it simple. Occasionally make eye contact with your customers and you will know when to respond and will do fine. Strike three will be if they ever have a customer have a similar experience.  


Nuevo Investors and general management, take note of your employees who look busy versus your employees who are busy. That is your hard earned money at stake there.
