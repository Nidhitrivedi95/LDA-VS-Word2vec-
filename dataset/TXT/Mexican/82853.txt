D17zqKVWM5BMC443mDVF4g Definitely one of my new regular stops! Flavorful food with amazing service. They start you out with chips, salsa and bean dip and I'd recommend the queso fundido appetizer served with ample chorizo smothered in cheese. Our table ordered a mixture of tacos, one gordita, and the enchilada plate- we were not disappointed! The shrimp taco was cooked perfectly and the gordita had a nice thick tortilla. The $5 margaritas top off the whole experience leaving us very full and satisfied!
