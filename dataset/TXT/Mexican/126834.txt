hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg My wife is a big fan of Chuck Hughes so I surprised her for our anniversary dinner. Although Chuck wasn't in that night, we really enjoyed the food and ambiance. I'm a big fan of seafood, so I ordered a scallop entree, which turned out to be the best scallops  I've ever had. Even my wife who isn't a big fan of scallops loved my entree and said it was possibly one of the best things she's eaten. Awesome and professional service. Highly recommended! Will definitely come back and looking forward to trying Chuck's other restaurant, Le Bremner.
