I got the house margarita for $5 and the tequila they used was high end. The queso dip and salsa were both spot on. I got the veggie enchiladas and they were to die for! Smothered in a black bean sauce they were seasoned well with goat cheese inside. A-maz-ing. My date got three tacos, the fried chicken was his favorite but the steak one was a little fatty he said. Other than that, I can't wait to go back!
