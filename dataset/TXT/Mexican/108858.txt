frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A If you can get seated next to the salsa bar then SCORE!! Lol.  So many tasty salsa's to choose from! Try them all!! Basically everything is amazing! The veggie tacos are delicious!  I love the peanut salsa and cilantro salsa.  The house margarita is big, fresh squeezed with citrus pieces to nibble on, and its so delicious!  My favorite menu item is the quesa!! The marin and the veggie are loaded with flavor! Oh, and try they guacamole! They put cranberries and jicama in it :)
