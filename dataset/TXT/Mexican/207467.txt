q7MorRPzU_J-iekeDKUKgw Despite my aversion to tequila, I love this spot.  The margaritas are delicious, but I love to ask for an extra glass of ice so when the drink gets close to done (and a little too sour) you can dilute it.  The patio is awesome, and though the little seats look cool, they're actually awkward to sit at for more than 5 minutes.  
Tried the food for the first time last night: ample servings and delicious.  
My only hesitation on giving the spot 5 stars, is I find the pricing a little high.
