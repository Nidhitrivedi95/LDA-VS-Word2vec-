6VZ4T_BnTl8swN-g06ZVYg I don't expect much from fast food chains, but a Mexican restaurant that runs out of beans? Really? 
The non bean items looked like the line workers literally threw the ingredients together. The tacos had a tiny amount of lettuce, so I assumed the lettuce was about to run out next, and the tortillas were stale.
