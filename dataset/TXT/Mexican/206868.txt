Q4AWWdBWe_ojYX1a4ffXFQ This El Dorado Express is a God send. I discovered the full restaurant a few years back and make it a point to visit every time I come to Vegas. So you can imagine my surprise and excitement level when I arrived memorial weekend to see there was an El Dorado on the strip. That was my first stop for food when I got to Vegas that night. I was in heaven at 1 am eating my carnitas burrito and they prices were super cheap!
