Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg This place is the reason I moved to Vegas. The service and every menu items I've had since coming here for the first time 12 years ago has amazed me every time. This place has what every restaurant is missing, the enthusiasm, initiative, and the attention to detail goes beyond the call of duty. Only complaint I have is the trumpet player, it's really really loud when it's 4 feet away from your head.
