wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ This place is hands down my favorite Mexican restaurant in Cleveland! 

Yes, there are more trendy places. You can go get a crazy taco somewhere or really unique gacamole for $10 somewhere else. But this place is authentic (as far as I can tell), cheap, super filling and delicious! 

The table salsa is probably my favorite table salsa ever. There are two kinds and both are nice and spicy. They also provide fresh chips and some pickled veggies to munch on (YUM). The sangrias are HUGE and there are a few Mexican beers to choose from, as well. 

The menu is large and so are the portions. Everything I have tried here so far has been really tasty. Nothing insane - very basic stuff - but I promise you that it's better than all of those chain Mexican places or the ten other restaurants with identical menus (see el Jalapenos and and Si Senior - I kid you not, the menus are the same). 

Servers were friendly and food came out pretty fast. I have zero complains. It also hasn't been crowded, in my experience. Like I said before, it's not trendy or innovative, really, but if you are just craving Mexican, this place is the best!
