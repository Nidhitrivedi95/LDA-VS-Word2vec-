GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog The Mexican dishes and margaritas here were good and spot on but we found the "new take" on the Asian dishes just missed the mark and were a total let down. 

The guacamole was so tasty and salty. It paired so well with our salt and air margaritas. The queso with chorizo was warm, gooey, greasy and perfect with warm tortillas. 

I was however very disappointed in the XO noodle dish. It was a very small serving with 4 shrimp, one scrambled egg and noodles rolled in balls. Flavor  was very faint. I could have skipped this entirely. They fooled me twice with the mango sticky rice dessert. I had my heart set on traditional mango sticky rice however the rice was not in the dish. It was more of whipped cream with a mango sauce, minimal mango tidbits, and a spoonful of rice crispy on top. Boo!!! It left me mad. 

So 4-5 stars for the yummy Mexican food. 0-1 stars for the sad Asian offerings.
