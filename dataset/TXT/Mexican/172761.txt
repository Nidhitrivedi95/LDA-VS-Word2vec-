medCzwjjGeReqxOt-iPVTg In all honesty, I'd give them a zero if I could. This place has gone downhill the past couple of years. The food is ALWAYS salty, I'm thinking they are reheating the Carne asada in the fryer. The food is thrown together and not appealing to the eye or stomach. The staff doesn't seem to care either. I will never go there again.
