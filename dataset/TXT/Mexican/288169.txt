Yevhl8bTwdJuu_LWKv-4Fw Paladar is okay. Good drinks and decent food but it's rather overpriced given that everything really is just okay. The service has always been mediocre. The happy hour is decent but it's only available in the bar, which is seriously unfortunate since during happy hour it's tough to get a seat there given the limited seating. Despite the downsides it is very conveniently located and has a nice environment and lovely patio. The place is always packed but I wouldn't recommend seeking Paladar out. If you're on Chagrin Blvd. and need a place to grab a drink check it out, but don't expect to be wowed.
