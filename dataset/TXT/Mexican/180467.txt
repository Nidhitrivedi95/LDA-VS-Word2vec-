It is supposed to be a restaurant and margarita bar but it has a very fast food vibe - think a more expensive version of chipotle. The time when I went in particular the chip and salsa bar was understocked and I wasn't able to eat any of the bottomless chips and salsa that I paid for during the course of my meal. This place pales in comparison to the restaurant that used to be here which only adds to the disappointment I feel about this venue.
