A2eA3LRbptrexCGw8fu67Q Hands down the best food truck. I've now gotten my family & co-workers hooked as well. I follow their schedule & any time they are within 10 miles, I'll go. My favorite is the carne asada but my co-workers all love the steak & bleu, all Thai'd up and the Papa Verde. That might even be the entire menu but I've yet to meet someone who didn't fall in love with (not just like) the place. Note: this comes with pico & guac bit I have them hold that.
