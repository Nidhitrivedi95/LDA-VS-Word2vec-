Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ Oh, Javier's how I love you so.  Not only is it located at one of the best hotel and casinos in Vegas, but it's also one of the best restaurants in Vegas. Let me start with the decor and atmosphere. It's modern, yet sexy with a Mexican flare. The staff is friendly and the food is even better. My hubby and I go every time we are in town and have never had an issue here. I love to order taquitos with the Peruvian beans. Ahhmazing!  Yes, it's a little pricey but that's like any other restaurant in a casino on the Vegas strip. So worth the $. I suggest going here before watching a Cirque show. ;)
