oJwEePZlKycThzft-LrUgw We were really looking forward to El Gringos as we wanted to see Scarborough's take on Mexican food. Firstly the menu.... It's more Tex Mex with a Caribbean and Cajun thrown in. Well, that's what it said. What we received ( and I am being kind here) was slop with coriander and lime juice.

Firstly the order was wrong, but despite that the chicken was undercooked and black beans cold. The overall assessment was that this was poorly cooked and didn't reflect in any way anything like Mexican / Cajun / Caribbean food. 

The staff were all young and were really nice as a positive, but is think this as the case in the kitchen too as whoever cooked our meal must have been inexperienced. In fairness the supervisor offered to reduce the bill, however, this didnt cover the fact we were served well below par meals.

We were really disappointed, but there you have it. Its rare that I vow never to return to a restaurant but this is one exception.
