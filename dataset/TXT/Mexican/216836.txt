R6cWq0FkVfV_Ee-YttlPyA Stopped here to get the kids some bean and cheese burritos while waiting for my daughters unaccompanied minor flight (that ended up being cancelled). The service was fast and the burritos were delicious. Like, adult delicious, not kid delicious. The tortillas were flaky and yummy, the beans were flavorful, and the cheese tasted fresh. I got a Pollo Burrito Bowl AZ style and it was pretty tiny for the $9 price tag. Even so, it was really good for airport food. The chicken was tender and moist and the bowl itself was seasoned well. 

The only downside to this place is the cost, but it's pretty typical for airport food. We paid $27 for two bean and cheese burritos, my burrito bowl, and a liter of water.
