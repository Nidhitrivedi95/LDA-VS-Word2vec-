uYoSb2rNi77LMQZ-Nn1Epg I've been going to A La Brasa almost weekly for over a year. The food is authentic Mexican and really, really tasty. They have specials every day (I'm a big fan of the buy 2 get 1 free taco deal on Tuesday, especially). The salsa is made fresh in-house, like everything! The owner works very hard to keep the place running at top quality - I think he's there seven days a week. They have a small staff but they're always really nice and courteous. Definitely a hidden gem and cannot recommend enough.
