Kx0MUrNQ737s-VVElk6Vig Food was great and inexpensive. The only thing I didn't appreciate is that it's so far from the strip and you could miss it if you don't look carefully. The place is a good size, and I believe it is family owned. I ordered Huevos Rancheros which was delicious but they served it with a tortilla dorada. I had never had that before, but it didn't take away from the plate. I think the interior could use a little sprucing up but it's not a big deal. Not really of fan of the salsas; too watery for my liking. Prices were reasonable. I would definitely go back again.
