lJh661dhjD5BDz5QrBEUeQ I'm new to Chandler. I stopped at the location on W Ray Rd. The food was OK. Before I left, I went to the men's room. The floor was littered with used paper towels, the room appeared disheveled and dirty, and the toilet seat was missing a bolt. If they can't keep the rest room clean and functional, I shudder to think what's happening in the kitchen. I gave it one star because I won't go there, or any Filberto's, again.
