Get ready for an affordable and delectable trip back in time. Nestled in what remains of Mesa's Citrus farming past, they don't do a lot here. But what they do, is done with friendly moth-watering expertise. 

If you like BBQ & Mexican fare and are up for no-drive-through Take Out or an outdoor, no-frills, picnic-table type dining experience read further.

Still with me? Good you're in for a total 360° feel-good experience. Your taste buds, stomach, and anyone waiting on you to bring them lunch or dinner will thank you.

J Bucks is hidden North of McDowell on Val Vista. 

Their barbeque rivals anything in the Valley. For me, the brisket eclipses everything here. It is life-changingly phenomenal, moist, smokey... and will stick in your mind for years, trust me. Be sure to try the other BBQ fare, like the pulled pork, burnt ends, and ribs. But me, I gotta have at some brisket each time. When I go, I tend to get a brisket sandwich with bean and I share a red chili beef quesadilla with whoever's with me. The Mexican food is on par with what's available from local upscale sit-down restaurants. You'll love the various salsas, especially the mango.

There's enough here to change it up each visit without feeling in a rut... even if you're like me and have to get some form of brisket EVERY SINGLE TIME you drop by.

They had me at Jalapeño. They keep me coming back with great service, food, and the farm-style homey experience.

Look for the weathervane. Don't miss out.
