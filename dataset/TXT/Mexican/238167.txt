SzB85-8tmDEvoapZSDTBkQ Growing up we lived down the road from an amazing taco shop. They had these amazing carne asada burritos that I have dreamed about for almost 15 years after moving away and the shop closing down. Robertos carne asada burrito is one degree less than the one that I probably remember as better as it was! But man, so excited to find something close! We love the rice and beans and the chimichanga and tacos... okay we've loved everything that we've ordered....
