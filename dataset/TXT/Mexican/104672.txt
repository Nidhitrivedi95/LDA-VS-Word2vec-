fGnILhhgE393e-8X9JIB4Q My sister and I were shopping at Vaughan Mills on Sunday and went to La Taquizza for lunch. Thanks to Yelp's Kris U and others for recommending this place, it is a great find indeed. The restaurant is quite small and nicely decorated. We shared chorizo quesadillas and steak burrito, they were delicious. My sis had black bean soup and she really liked it too. The service was friendly, but they brought us wrong food twice - the second time we were ready to take it as it looked really good :-) 
Somebody here on Yelp mentioned mango margaritas, I tried one but didn't like it that much. It was too sweet for my taste. 
Anyway, I highly recommend trying out this little place, it is a great value for money.
