F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw This place is great!! Driving by, saw it in passing. Amazing customer service & MAGNIFICENT food!! Creamed corn, pico de gallo (with chips), and smoked Gouda dumplings are a MUST try. My drink must've came from a golden dream because my gosh, the pineapple margarita is a god send. I recommend Cleveland get hip to this place. If not, suit yourself. More for me.  GO TO MOMOCHO!!!! They have the coolest and most helpful/thorough staff in the Land!
