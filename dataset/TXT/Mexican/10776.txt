_XN-GwzZwAyIqLKJsl2htg My new favorite restaurant. Everything here is amazing. It's a bit pricey but for the quality it is worth it. I got the al pastor pad Thai, the guacamole. The mixed greens salad, some sushi. We ate family style and everything was 100000. I can't wait to go back it was so amazing. I want to try other menu items because I'm so impressed with how good my first experience was. I heard it becomes night clubby- at night so keep that in mind. Also their brunch is bottomless!!!!
