VRwT0pscR5vESCrAnUpNwQ We went here awhile ago and the tacos were just okay. However, we went back tonight and the tacos were great! It seems like they changed the recipes a bit. I loved the chicken tinga and carne asada. The pork was good too. I'm a fan of their guacamole. The best part is the hot sauce/salsa bar. So much hot sauce. Great spot for beer and tacos.
