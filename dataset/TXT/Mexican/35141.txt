51K92JdkWICGDvvVCBYhFA I really want to say YAY for the staff here.  When I had seen the small size of the side of guacamole I got snippy thinking it was tiny. The staff was so sweet they offered me more. I don't know if they heard me but the disappointment is with the company and giving tiny portions, not with the people who really went out of their way to make me happy.  The staff is terrific there, sadly the side portions can be small. However, they do have a salsa bar where how much you get of the many varieties is optional.
