wKA2y-F_fPcBDOkpzDB9eQ I could sit and eat the bean dip and table side guac all day. It's excellent. You could do it too, because the service is OUTSTANDING! 

But we can't all survive on chips, so I order more food to satisfy my inner fat-kid. I haven't had anything that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed, but I am a huge fan of the fajitas...and those oh-so-good fresh tortillas. 

Bring a wheel barrow. They may just roll you out for free.
