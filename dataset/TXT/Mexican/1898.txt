-dgUbX_lFqklJuf29A7piQ Judging by the reviews here, it seems like this place is visited more by travelers than locals. My wife & I found this place to get a quick bite after getting our photo at the AZ Capitol (we have 19/50 states). We were on a 3 hour layover at PHX on our way to PDX, so we needed something fast. El Matador was standard Mexican fare that was decent and fast.
