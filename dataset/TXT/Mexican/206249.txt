PZtY6wMyrVHNX6kfhkL7Iw Great casual Mexican restaurant . Our favorite is Serranos ... But when we need a quick bite closer to home some burros is our go to spot . You get chips and salsa while you wait for your food. And your drinks are self arrive .Both the chips & salsa are ok .. Nothing fantastic . Onto the Burros . They are dynamite! My fav is the rod burro . It's 1/2 green sauce ,1/2 red sauce . On the red 1/2 chorizo is mixed in with the beef and red sauce .. It's so good and a bit spicy which is why I like to start with the red side and finish with the green. Once you bite into the green side it cools your mouth instantly with its creamy green chili goodness .. I have been wanting to try other items but I just can't!!
