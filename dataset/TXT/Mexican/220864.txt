rjlAUHT8B6KhKAmkZqS1xw I have been to Ladera 5 or 6 times now.  Best patio around!  Food is great but service is slow and just not good.  I was there for brunch Sunday and it wasn't too crowded, but my waitress was slow and would just disappear!  I had to track her down for drink refills and our check. This is the 3rd time I have been there and the service has sucked.  I really want this restaurant to survive!!   I hope the service staff becomes more attentive to their guests!  Restaurants like Hillstone and Mora make service their priority!!
