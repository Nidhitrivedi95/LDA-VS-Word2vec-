wJ84TZZTuT0EdLzPHt8RDw Service was ok, but it's a busy Friday night. I would never come back or recommend it to anybody for the food. They get 2 stars instead of 1 based on the good happy hour drinks. Tostada was soggy to the point of not even being able to pick it up. Rice and beans taste like they're day old and reheated. Salsa is bland, guacamole is bland. This is my first and likely last time visiting here. There are much better mexican options in the valley.
