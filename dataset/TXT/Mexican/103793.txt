Food is really really good, though.  I got 2 enchilads with the green chile pork, red sauce, over easy egg, and guac. Definitely worth the additional cash, I t hink. 

Overall the atmosphere of this place is decent. It's like the chipotle of enchialada places which is nice. Nothing that sets it apart, really.
