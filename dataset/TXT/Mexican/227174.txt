S1jjDv8mwJ4psGQA4b8RjA I would consider myself pretty traveled in the land of hookah lounges and I liked this place

+the layout is good. you can either sit at a table to play some cards or whatever OR you can sit in one of the couch-booth areas.
+the staff is great.  Always attentive and willing to answer questions about the shisha 
+if you want to have a solo night this place is a good spot since no one will bug you and you can peacefully hang out and smoke by yourself

The only thing I didn't like from a few times I went was that they weren't playing middle eastern music.  I know some people complain about that music, but are you serious?  That's part of the culture, if you don't like it, don't go to a middle eastern spot.  That would be like eating at a taqueria and getting annoyed that they're playing latin music.
