K-uQkfSUTwu5LIwPB4b_vg Great spot! Came here for lunch and split:

Table side Guacamole: great!
Street Corn: amazing- asked for it off the cob so that it wouldn't get stuck in my teeth!
Brisket Torta: ok, brisket was a bit dry
Pork Shoulder Tacos: tasty but not much meat

Our service was good, the patio was beautiful and the food was tasty. I'd come back for sure!
