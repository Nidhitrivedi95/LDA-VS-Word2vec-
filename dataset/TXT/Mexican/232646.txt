sPd3E7lFzd_yooiq-ekxtQ I used to really like Pedro's west about 15 years ago so I was pretty excited to attend a birthday dinner at Pedro's east on a Saturday night. I'm not sure if my taste has gotten better or if their food has gotten less flavorful?! I was pretty disappointed with the entire event. 

The complimentary chips and salsa were bland and felt like fillers. We had to request tortillas and when we finally got them there weren't enough for the table. The waiter was friendly but couldn't remember to bring us napkins. The restaurant was very warm, I had to excuse myself to go outside to get fresh air twice. 

On a positive note, I enjoyed my Malibu blended margarita. The side table guacamole was good enough. And the chicken and sautéed onions in my fajita entree were flavorful. 

I won't be going back and I wouldn't recommend. But if you do go, skip the freebies, get a Margarita and if you must eat- try the fajitas.
