p-w6g8cuQq5PU_4U1XNCzQ I've had this place bookmarked for a while and finally had the chance to try it out. You know from walking in the door this place is authentic by their greeting in Spanish.

My boo and I were quickly seated at a booth and told our waiter would be right with us. Soon enough our waiter came to take our drink order and ask if we had any questions. He also brought out some heaven in a bowl aka salsa which was to die for. He was very friendly and welcoming during the whole meal and even helped us with our questions we had on using a groupon.

We initially didn't order any drinks but after seeing how everyone else raved about the margaritas I had to try one. I was certainly not disappointed. I had he mango marg which was super fresh and delicious. My boo had the 1800 which he said was great too.

For food we shared the fajitas for two. I thought it was very good but felt there could have been more meat than peppers. I did enjoy that we each got our own tortillas, rice and beans though.

Overall I thought this place was great but the only reason for a four star was the prices. I felt it was quite expensive compared to other Mexican restaurants near by. I'm sure I'll still be back soon anyways and can't wait to try something new!
