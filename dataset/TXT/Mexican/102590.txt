F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw Went for a late dinner on a Diner's Drive-In's and Dive (DDD) recommendation.

They were booked up, but indicated they would have tables set aside for walk-ins and that if we came during off-hours that we would be fine.  We had a group of four.  We showed up at 8pm per their recommendation and they said they wouldn't be able to seat us for another 1.5-2 hrs.  We lucked out and grabbed the corner of the bar after 15-20 minutes of standing around.

Margaritas were good, but I'm a bit of a tex-mex / mexican snob and didn't like to see that they were pre-mixed in gallon jugs

Guacamole sampler we got had two solid ones (blue cheese and crab) and one miss (pinneapple).

Entree's are all pseudo taco / fajita style.  Our group had carnitas, 2 hangar steaks and the tuna.  The steaks were above average.  Tuna wasn't a good fit for the fajita style set up.  Carnitas were probably some of the best I've ever had.

Atmosphere was cute / eclectic, but nothing that blew me away and a little too dark lighting-wise.

Price point was a bit much.  Average entree price was about $14 and (in my opinion) it should have been closer to $10.

Bottom line: I would definitely go back the next time I'm in Cleveland.  This spot is a better date-place than group-place.
