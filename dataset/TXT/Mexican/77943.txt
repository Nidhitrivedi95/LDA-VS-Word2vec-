cKRGB46UJp3z3TgVlzk4tw Definitely a good idea.. But not executed well. Food is mediocre and service is awful. The queso was chunky and kind of chalky? Was not a fan at all. Our waitress was friendly, but very slow and inattentive. My water sat empty for what felt like a lifetime. Our food took forever, and so did our check. Like I said, great idea.. Perfect atmosphere. Should probably work on the important stuff though.
