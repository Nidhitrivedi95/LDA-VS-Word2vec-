1Dfx3zM-rW4n-31KeC8sJg I love the Mexican guy who barely speaks English at the drive-thru. He's really friendly and helpful. I also brought in a coupon that they no longer accept, but explained my situation to the manager and she worked with me. That was nice. I won't give it 5 stars because it is Taco Bell and there is always something left to be desired, such as a burrito that explodes into your lap two bites in. But this place is awesome.
