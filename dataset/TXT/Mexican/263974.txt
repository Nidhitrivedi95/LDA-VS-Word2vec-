WB8BmFMORvshjb7tBw0e0Q I really enjoy Azul.  I've been coming here for years (I couldn't try their amazing mojitos when I first started coming here, it's been that long).  Definitely get the tableside quacamole and chips.  The quac is a little expensive, but it's prepared fresh for you the second you order it.  The chips are homemade and perfectly crunchy and salty with that amazing "just out of the frier" sheen to them.

The food has been better, though.  I heard a few years back that it changed hands.  It used to be "authentic" Mexican food with a great family running the show.  One of our favorite servers is never there, and I think he was part of the first iteration of Azul.  It isn't as spicy as it once was and the sides are just that - sides.  Easily forgotten.

I still enjoy their huge burritos, my mom gets chiles rellenos like always, and my step-dad gets their enchiladas and fajitas and happily finishes his plate.

Expect to eat, drink, and be merry here.  At night when it's swinging, the ambiance is a nice warm buzz and you leave feeling super-satisfied.
