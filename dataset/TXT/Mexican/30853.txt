4DLsC4BTUoEqFGusetQVlQ A popular tacos restaurant that has been popping up in several locations around Toronto along with it's ever popular sidecar business of Sweet Jesus. We walked in on a weekday looking for a late dinner and was greeted by a sparsely lit space with booming rap music. I'm not sure what I expected from a tacos place, but it definitely wasn't darkness and a heavy bass. 

Decor, music and atmosphere aside, the food itself was a hit and miss. The Avocado Mango Salad was fresh and bright, a great accompaniment to the tacos. The Carne Asada taco was delicious, the beef steak was tender and balanced perfectly against the toppings of salsa, avocado and cilantro. The In Cod We Trust taco was really odd, something about the toppings and the fish didn't work for me. Maybe it had too much red cabbage? I didn't like that one. Also, the portions are small for the price. After two tacos I would be normally still be hungry if it wasn't so late at night. 

In all, the experience was okay. The tacos are good but pricey and small.
