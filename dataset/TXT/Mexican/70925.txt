C1p3eAhzX3w8VxsJKH3iXw Left after ten minutes because longest line I've ever seen at a chipotle nationwide did not move. Staff did not seem to know how to do their jobs at all and were confused by fax/email orders. Visited location twice before in last two weeks and service was also slow. Will never visit this location again.
