yOBDY3fpaTpX4Q5JpmExMg Service is not good. Food took forever to come. We ate almost the entire basket of chips. The salsa was so runny and came in a carafe. Salsa doesn't HAVE to be chunky so long as you dip a chip and can scoop it up. Salsa was so runny, it just made your chip soggy and never stayed on the chip. Think of the watery watercolor of salsas and you'll get my point. 

My husband ordered a shrimp cocktail and never got a spoon to eat it. I ordered the Barbacoa plate (the special on Saturdays) and never got tortillas, cilantro, onion or lime. Barbacoa was served wet but meat was dry and chewy, instead of tender and juicy. It tasted old or reheated.

Beans were not flavorful, and something was off on them and couldn't eat them. I love beans and it takes a lot to put me off of them. The rice was bland. We didn't eat our food, we left it on the table, that's how not palatable it was!! Disappointed. NEVER Visit again.
