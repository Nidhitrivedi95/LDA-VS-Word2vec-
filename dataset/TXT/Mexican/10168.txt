_XN-GwzZwAyIqLKJsl2htg I have eaten here twice now and I couldn't be happier! The food was absolutely amazing and my server Nicole was great! The vibe is super fun! I absolutely recommend this place! The Ahi Tuna Tostada appetizer is my favorite! I like that it caters to sushi eaters and Mexican food eaters. I will come back again!
