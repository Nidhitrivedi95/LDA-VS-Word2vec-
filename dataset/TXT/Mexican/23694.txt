2PnRXLAN3KFEu4g0OUL2iw So, with many fond memories of the Señor Taco in Fountain Hills, we decided to come here Sunday night. 

We use to hit the FH location twice a month for a long time. But neither the food here, nor the prices are anything like the original. In fact, the food is barely m'eh, and expensive relative to their nearby competition.

If you are looking for fast casual, try America's Taco just a few miles south, or Habanero on the other side of the parking lot near Walmart's, or even Rubio's just a few hundred yards away.  If however you prefer sit down, try Los Olivos Norte virtually next door to Rubio's. 

Our dinner for three came to a pricey $35.31. We ordered the Carne Asada Burrito $8.99, the Shredded Beef Burrito $7.99, the Mimi Beef Chimi $8.99, a side order of 4 oz Guacamole and Chips $2.99. Of the three, only the Carne burrito was finished.  All of us didn't fair too well a few hours later. 

Sorry!
