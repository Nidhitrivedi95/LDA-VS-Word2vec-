UoRSHohdGuzfrpydZ9j0Lg My fiancé and I went to dinner at Luchitas last night.  I had the Puerco and couldn't have been happier.  It reminded me of my time living in Hermosillo. The pulled chicken flautas with green salsa and media crema made me smile they were mildly sweet, fresh, and flavorful.  
I will definitely return.
