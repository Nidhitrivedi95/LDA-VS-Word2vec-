They usually have Groupon's so it makes it even more worth while, but I still go regardless. Better than the standard casino Hispanic restaurant, but nothing amazing. Service is always great, the atmosphere is nice. They're open until midnight which is definitely a plus for me since I work swing. They have a small bar which is open 24 hours, but I'm not sure if the kitchen is. Nice place to go if you want to avoid the casino environment and just get a good meal.
