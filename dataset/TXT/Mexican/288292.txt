Yevhl8bTwdJuu_LWKv-4Fw If you enjoy Latin food, this is probably the only place in Cleveland you can get it :-)

I love the guacamole and sangria.  It's not my favorite place in Beachwood, but definitely a good place to take friends for a fun meal.  It would be cool if they could make the bar area bigger to allow for comfortable hanging out/eating there.
