TVtnQyn3ka60r2t9xRwKPQ A friend came over for lunch a few weeks ago...so I suggested we walk down the street and try the restaurant.  While the sign said open that day at 11:30 they weren't.  So I suggested we go today for lunch...and I see they aren't open until 5.  It's summer lunch patio weather people!  I give up on the lunches.
