QMaaLfedGzNhHz6PZKAUkw This place used to be good or atleast as good as the rest of the Filibertos I have been to.  Recently in the last few years, the place has become run down, the staff is often mean and disrepectful, and their food is not to par with other locations.  I have never seen such a pile of crap Filibertos in my life and that says alot!  I just got extremely ill after my last meal there, the worst stomache ache I have ever had, this after being treated like crap by their employee when ordering.  I will not be going back to this location again!  May as well close this location FiliB's!   It is a ghost town most of the time and now I know why.
