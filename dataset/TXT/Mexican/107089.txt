FoKx_RP4kUM-aiGo3wlUUw Don't be fooled by the outside of the building where this restaurant is located.  The inside is cute and authentic, and the wait staff are friendly, attractive, and helpful.
The food is OUTSTANDING!  I've eaten here many times with family and co-workers, and no one ever has had a complaint.  I like spinach enchiladas made with fresh spinach (not canned), and these can't be beat.  
The margaritas are great, too.   The usual pre-meal chips and salsa comes with both salsa and a bean dip which is unusual and really, really good.  The chips are hot and fresh.  It's hard not to overdue and be full when dinner arrives.
