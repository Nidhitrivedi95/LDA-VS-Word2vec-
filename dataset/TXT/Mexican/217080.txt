R7LyTeiOHLyTNkA8HssBRQ In a previous review, I mentioned the promise of the PLATOS, aka the combination plate. If you are disheartened by the cost of a taco at Los Tacos, try the PLATOS. You get meat, tortillas and a side salad of garnishes. Sometimes they will let you split the meat. My husband and I are able to share it, and we each get 4 tacos. That's right, a total of 8! Granted, they are not the size of your standard Los Tacos offering, but we're definitely full.
