They are not completely cash only, but do have a minimum on credit cards. You pay inside the small grocery store (which also has many delicious items including unique candies and drinks). Beware though- the red sauce is VERY spicy. Even if you can handle a lot of spice, I would be mindful of that. A must try for all taco lovers!
