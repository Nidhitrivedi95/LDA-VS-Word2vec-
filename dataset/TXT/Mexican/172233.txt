mB_cI1tCrNxxvr2e2myNrQ If you looooove Taco Bell like I do, then this Cantina is something you'll enjoy during your stay in Sin City! The 2 story Cantina has alcoholic Baja Blasts, good music depending on who your DJ is, happy, dancing workers taking your order, and of course, the deliciousness of Taco Bell.

Food: prices will of course be a bit more than your local Taco Bell but you can't get the alcoholic Baja Blasts anywhere else! There's different flavors and you can pick from tequila, vodka, rum or whiskey.

Seating: there's outdoor seating on the first floor but if you take the stairs to the 2nd floor, you could eat and people watch or watch whatever they put on the big screen up top. If you forgot your hot sauces after you get your order, don't worry! There's a hot sauce area upstairs as well.

Ordering: after you order, you wait for your name to be called. If you're upstairs, there's a digital screen that'll let you know if your food is ready. You can watch your food being made through the giant glass screen as well.
