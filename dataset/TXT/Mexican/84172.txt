d4qwVw4PcN-_2mK2o1Ro1g This is so good! Trust me, I'm a natural Latino that's ate at A LOT of taco trucks out there. This place is comparable to one of the best taco trucks that I've ate from!!!! (Except this restaurant is REALLY CLEAN!)

Now the vibe is really chill. I've liked how the hostess is always diligently seating us, and every time I'm amazed at how I get to see a sweet Latina lady making those sexy pink tacos from scratch! The arina/corn tortillas seem to be made in front of us. 

Mike - he's the bartender / waiter. Go to this man. His customer service is an A+. That man's name should be changed to Johnny....because he's Johnny on the spot!

Kendra -She's so sweet. A+ to her too.

Manager lady that checks up on every table to make sure things are okay. A+

FOOD
------------------------------------------
***get your pink taco*** its something to talk about with your friends.

I ordered the lunch special "PINK chicken TACO - substituted instead with al carbon steak." It's the house specialty with pink corn tortillas, stuffed with black beans grilled, salsa arbol, pickled onions, and avocado.


The wet burrito was good, but those tacos...they take me by storm every time.
