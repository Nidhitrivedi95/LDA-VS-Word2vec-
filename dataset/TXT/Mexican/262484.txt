vz8HFGsITt6aj-nyXkAEFg I've been coming to El Encanto for 20 years. It's a beautiful place with pretty good food. I've always expected to wait, but on my first time back in years with family from out of town we waited 90 minutes to sit while others have come and gone. 

We tried calling in to make reservations but were told they weren't taking reservations. Upon arriving and putting our name down we were asked why we hadn't called in a reservation. After explaining the situation we were told it would be 30 minutes. Not a bad wait but 90 is uncalled for. 

It's sad to see service suffer so badly but I have to say this will be my last trip here. Not worth the drive, not worth waiting this long.
