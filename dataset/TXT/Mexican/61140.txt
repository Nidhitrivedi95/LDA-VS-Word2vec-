as_fyujgsdwtV56n31z-Sw Like. Ugh, I just don't know about this place. I feel like it has a good thing going but it's just "too much." The establishment itself is very modern and nice. The had a table for two immediately at 7pm on a Friday, so that was great! Service was pretty good. We got our food really quickly. 

For the food... We ordered the "make your own guacamole"... Which is $6 and each topping you add in is either .50 or $1.00. We added corn which was .50 and goat cheese which was a dollar. We paid a dollar for one tiny little teaspoon full of goat cheese to sit at the top. Not cool. They don't serve normal chips on the side, which I didn't expect. Or love.

The tacos were ehh at best. They all sound so appetizing on the menu. I was not impressed by any of the ones I had, neither was my husband. I had a chicken tinga, crispy avocado, and chorizo and potato. Each one of them were drenched in sauces. Like I had to drain the sauce from each one. The only flavor they had was from the sauce. And for whatever reason, each taco had a huge handful of cabbage on them which totally ruined it for me. 

They have an impressive selection of rum, though, which I didn't try. The bar was busy the whole time we were there. I feel like Bomba has promise, and in the future I would be willing to give it another chance. But for now, when I'm craving tacos, I think I will stick to the local taco joint in Lakewood.... (Barrio).
