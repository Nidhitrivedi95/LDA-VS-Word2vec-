They also offer an order of chorizos for free with your yelp check-in! Can't beat that. 
I ordered 2 chicken tinga tacos with rice & beans & a carne asada taco. My fiance ordered 2 beer battered shrimp tacos & a chorizo breakfast taco. Everything was great. We each got beans & rice for $22.00! Not bad.
