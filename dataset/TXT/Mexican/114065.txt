gEv1Og5uGDLw9HkbKSGUZw I came here on a Saturday night with a party of 10 for a friend's birthday.  We were generally unimpressed.  The service was the biggest disappointment; each time we needed something, it would take 10-15 mins to be able to order as the waitress would disappear on us and our orders were all mixed up when they came out.  Plus, the waitress seemed exasperated when someone dared ask a question about something on the menu.  Furthermore, the food was on the expensive side for just okay quality and small portions. (The portion sizes were fine for me, but some of the men in the party were left quite unsatisfied.)  The salsa and chips were quite good as was my margarita, but the quesadilla and taco I ordered were a bit too greasy and nothing special.   Unfortunately, the music was so loud that it made it very difficult to have discussions.  I doubt I would ever return to this restaurant.
