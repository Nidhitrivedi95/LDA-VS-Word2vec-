Z8SXv1u_6rKicQy9P7G6fw Love how spacious this place is. It can fit all sizes of groups which is why it's never a hassle to stop by. 

We always get the parrilladas combination because it feeds about 4 ppl. Order extra beans/rice per person and you'll be set for an awesome meal. 

The salsas do lack in flavor. The regular salsa they normally bring out is undesirable, while the requested "spicy" salsa is water down and flavorless.
