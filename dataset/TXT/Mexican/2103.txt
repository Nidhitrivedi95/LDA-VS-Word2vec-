-e_UQJVTzIPweX4TcPUYVw Mexx 32 is what I imagine "Mexican Night" is in a Caucasian household.

Flavorless OVERPRICED menu items. Nothing anyone ordered in our party seemed to be made with high quality ingredients even though they charge like it is. And $4 for a tiny scoop of sweet pinto beans and a tiny scoop of standard white/brown rice???

And to top it off we had terrible service. I'm pretty sure our server purposely waited 10+ minutes after giving us our water and chips and salsa so that Happy Hour could end so we could not order anything from that menu. Then pulled the same disappearing act much of the rest of our time there.
