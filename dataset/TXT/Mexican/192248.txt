With guacamole made fresh at your table, margaritas with real lime juice, and food so incredibly good it's easy to see that this locally owned business is anything but average. Service is excellent and if you are on a lunch break or bringing the kids for dinner food comes quickly. If you are wanting to visit or sit for a while, there is no pressure to hurry either, the owners/staff want you to be happy every time. We definitely have been very impressed and are happy to recommend Compadres to our friends and neighbors.
