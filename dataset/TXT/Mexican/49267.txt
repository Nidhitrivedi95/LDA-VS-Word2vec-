8nNB_yG1gzVpbqNH2EBucg I went here with my parents as we were visiting my grandmother nearby.  The service was some of the best we have ever experienced and the food was amazing too.  My parents and I started with the cornbread which was hot, fresh, and delicious.  For our entrees we shared three things which were all wonderful.  The trout salad had delicious and crispy red trout on top of a delicious salad which had spicy walnuts in them.  We also had both the seafood and mushroom enchilada that were even better!  We don't eat shellfish out, and they were more than willing to take out the small amount of shellfish in it.  

My parents also told the waiter it was my birthday coming up and they gave us a complimentary Ancho Fudge Pie with a birthday candle on top.  It was one of the most delicious deserts we ever had and seemed like a perfect cross between a lava cake and brownie.  Plus there is a PokeStop on the premises and as we were about ready to leave, I caught a Pikachu that I renamed Z'Tejachu.  After posting my experience on Facebook and sharing it with others, friends who have lived in the Phoenix and Austin areas also raved about their wonderful experiences at Z'Tejas.
