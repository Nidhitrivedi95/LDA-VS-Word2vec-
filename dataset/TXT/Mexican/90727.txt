DXl9YviWyzAwMeUtrBPW7w Decided to try Barrio.
Wish I didn't.

Service: Unfriendly staff with poor ability to both get us seated and to recommend/explain dishes and drinks. 

Food: Easily the worst Mexican I've had in the city. My steak was incredibly undercooked (basically raw) and when explaining this to the waiter I received a "I think that is how it comes"

Recognize it's a new establishment, but certainly a blemish in the great lineup of other restaurants that Leslieville has to offer.

Go to La Carnita instead.
