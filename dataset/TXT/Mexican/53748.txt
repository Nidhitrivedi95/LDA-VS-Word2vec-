9Q1ZtzTPFWG4fJiFSko5Xg $45 for two very tasty and unique entrees plus uno Margarita. The chips and salsa were on par with their gourmet menu. Side dishes as common as beans and rice were refreshingly tasty. The service was impeccable. Ask for Mario from Yugoslavia as your waiter. Can't go wrong with Mario. The manager was very open to conversation, not your usual hit and run meet and greet. Yes, the food is pricey. You will spend more here for Mexican food because it's gourmet. What does that mean exactly? That was my question going in and my answer was very tasty and some nice and spicy dishes. My wife who is very hard to please left her comfort zone and ordered some tacos with a tomatillo and pineapple sauce. She was very happy she ventured outside her world of a la carte tacos. Although this is not your everyday Mexican joint it proves to be a welcomed detour on your journey through Mexican cuisine.
