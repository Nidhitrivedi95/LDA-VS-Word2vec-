lsGIcUOadXjaRtKFNtrq8Q After repeating my order 4 times to an inattentive cashier and waiting 20 minutes in line , my order was still incorrect . I only ordered 2 meals , one with no sour cream or pico . Of course both are on my tostada . Oh , and the cashier forgot my drinks . He wondered why I was still waiting at the window after another 5 minutes . I will never return to this location .
