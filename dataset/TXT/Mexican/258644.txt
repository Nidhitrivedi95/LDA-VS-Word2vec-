vMKQaR8bI2saI7rz8H5MYg I have always gone to the Elizabeth location, but I like this one even better. I feel like it is cleaner and more organized, but the same great food! Everything is good, and you get a ton of food for the money. My personal favorite is the taco salad- no shell. That way I can load up on chips and guac too. I love the salsa bar!
