1HfkEkNhI6XJXkgrCTBKpw Right next door to my new favorite salon is The Urban Tap, a cute little place with shiny new TVs and a chalkboard menu of microbrews. I was impressed with the menu, which offered more vegetarian options than I'm used to. I ordered a fried tofu sandwich, which was good. I don't normally pay attention to timing, but it was pretty  slow (10-15 minutes.) My date noted that a sandwich was sitting on the kitchen counter for at least five minutes before someone grabbed it. A sizeable group of young boys were near our table--they seemed out of place in a sports bar, but I guess it's good to know that the place is kid-friendly. Overall, still some kinks to work out, but a decent little place for a quick bite and beer.
