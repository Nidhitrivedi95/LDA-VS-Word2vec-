iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg Probably one of the best taco in the city. Every taco was delicious and unique compared to other places.

Get one of the freshly squeezed drinks too, they're refreshing in the sun and helps kill the spiciness if you went with too much of the sauce.

Would have had 5 stars if the space wasn't so small and very very limited seating. Food is definitely a 5 star though.
