F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw Had a great experience! Our waiter was incredibly funny and knowledgeable and chatted amiably with us when he found out we were from Michigan. 

The margarita flight is a must try if you like margaritas. The best one I tried was the mango with a spicy salt rim. My second favorite was the blood orange with a salt rim and my least favorite (although it was still awesome) was the pomegranate with a sugar rim. We also had the trio of guacamoles, and they were all good--pineapple, smoked trout, and goat cheese. I loved the blistered shishito peppers--I could eat them all day every day! They were great in the tacos as well. Three of us got tacos, and I got the beef short rib tamales, which were kind of like a deconstructed tamale, with the short rib meat on top of the corn masa. All of it was delicious! For dessert, we got the vanilla bean flan, which was very smooth and full of real vanilla bean specks, but I'm not sure that I'd get it again (just personal preference). 

Making reservations was a breeze, and I appreciated the reminder phone call the day of our reservation. I'd come back again when I'm in Cleveland!
