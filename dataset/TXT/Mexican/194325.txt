OsuBqr2L0-5W8LGAsg-p8g This place is great. Hardly find any Sonoran dogs that are this good. Though, those from Tucson are better but this is good enough for the Phx area. The cons are that the tacos are quite tiny and they only accept cash. There is a so called salad bar so you can fill in extra ingredients if the dogs don't have enough of your favorites. I would come again when I'm craving for Mexican food. The location is easy to find. It is in the corner. However, if you drive from Broadway, you can't really get into the place. You must turn left then make a U turn shortly after to do it. Most people take it to go but I would rather eat there so everything is not too soggy,especially the buns after a drive home.
