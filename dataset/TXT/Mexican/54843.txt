9vub2LM7Djy8P-LPumcLXA Tried a selection of their taco offerings. The Tripas Tacos were GAF! They're like little folds of pork cracklin heaven. Recommend the Frijoles Charros. If they offered them in a gallon chug I could chug them all day. 

I was hungry so I forgot to take a picture but they are simple enough I could've downed a few more.
