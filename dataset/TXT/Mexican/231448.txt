sNAU_ItzmB-TIgmWwqRlEw The service here is absurd! I ordered through the iPhone app to help expedite and work around my prior slow experiences, but that didn't help! I ordered an hour before my pick up time to help give this group time to make two burritos, but apparently that wasn't enough. When I arrived on time to pick up my food I was basically called a liar And told  that I was too early to pick up and to wait 20 more minutes. When I showed them the confirmation email validating my pick up time, I just got a snide remark from the staff as she continued to ignore me and help others. It wasn't until I threatened to leave and not pay for my meal, was I taken seriously and provided food. 

I considered speaking to a manager but judging on the filth on every table and no napkins or utensils to be found, I didn't even want to waste my time. That made a statement that if there was a "leader" on duty, It wasn't someone I would have wanted to speak to. 

This experience, among others, will make this visit my last at this location!
