N_lMOTsjqshTluB83cfC0w Here in the Creek folks are kind with lovely manners. This is just the sort of establishment we deserve. The food as well spiced without being overly salty the staff is amazing; even though there was a bustling Pace I was never left unattended. The salsa has a nice amount of heat and if you want a little more request the Diablo. HIGHLY recommend this for local semi-americanized Mexican fare with flare and great management and service.
