XMrLwzmEAsfNpbKRC7vUzQ I have always loved TacoMac for their roasted wings but tonight something was very off. The "roasted" wings were clearly fried and tasted of oil.  The ranch and blue cheese cups for dipping had maybe a teaspoon each. We had to ask for more and even then that wouldn't have filled even one dipping cup. The hot buffalo sauce was definitely not hot and frankly tasted like BBQ sauce, which we did not order. Also, now the food comes in paper buckets. What is up with that? If I am paying a premium for wings, I would like a plate. I'm not at KFC. Overall, it was highly disappointing and I doubt I will return.
