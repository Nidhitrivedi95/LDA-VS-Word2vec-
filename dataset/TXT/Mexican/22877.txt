2jzM7PSeG8OwZ5EvocCpQA My biggest issue is that when you place an order ahead of time, the point is so that you can walk in, pay, and walk out. Otherwise, I'd just hop in line like the other poor planners (which I typically am 85% of the time). Well this Chipotle just completely disregarded the purpose of ordering online. I waited LONGER than had I just gotten in line. Seriously, the line was making laps around me.
