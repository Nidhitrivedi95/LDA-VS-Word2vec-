uN2oZDJGO078ExbbV_DGmA Pretty unimpressed with it. I went in on a whim because I was in the mood for a burrito and also wanted to "test" just how good my favorite place which is just west of Bathurst & Sheppard is. The food wasn't bad by any stretch but it felt like a step step down even from the major burrito chains (like the Boyz). 
It all tasted just not super fresh...I dunno how to describe it.
Good on them for having beer available though! Gotta love that.
And what was also good to see/taste was their spicy is actual spicy...not Frank's Red Hot "spicy"
