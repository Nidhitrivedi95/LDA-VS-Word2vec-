5G-i1t7VXLGByswnCKvrDQ My favorite Mexican restaurant in the area!! The food always tastes great, unlimited chips and salsa, the margaritas are also delicious. The service has always been good and the employees are a lot of fun on Cinco de Mayo and on birthdays! Went here for my 21st bday! Also, you can't beat the prices. During the spring/summer they have a really nice patio area that you can enjoy your meal on.  They also do a reward system where your tenth meal is free. They also offer coupons on Groupon!
