8USUyIeN39rurnqCn5cA0w I usually judge a Mexican restaurant by the flavor of a few items. 1) Chip and salsa.  2) Rice and Beans.  3) Cheese enchiladas with red sauce. If these items pass my tastebud challenge then usually the other food items are fantastic. They passed with flying colors!! I have to say I live in California and have not found a Mexican restaurant that was as good as I had here and I am surrounded by Mexican restaurants. Amazing food and I will be back again when I come to visit!
