zlZQM-cJPVW7FHJsYTvyYg Ok... Mixed review. I thought the food was very good, but the menu was a bit pricey for this type of Mexican food. And it's nice that they have $.99 drafts... But the service was absolutely terrible. It was almost like the waiter had way too many tables too far apart or something. That actually made it a bad overall experience.

But my wife liked the food so we will give it one more try sometime. Personally, I'm not looking forward to it.
