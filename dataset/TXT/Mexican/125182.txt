hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg I like the food here except that it is a little pricey for the service sizes.  Great ambiance and service.  I always wondered why it is not as popular as Cafe Leone across the path.   Great enchiladas but ask for 2 or they'll give you one.  Great sauces.  Carne asada is tasty.  Nice bar menu, fresh food and spacious for business lunch.
