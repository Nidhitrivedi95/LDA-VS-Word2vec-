macHk8_6D11iBp2HlbhFLg The food here was pretty good and we even took the burritos for the nice gentle men that were helping us with the fence but the thing that we hated from them was that there was way too much grease inside the tacos, and they even gave our that we order and gave it to someone else who ordered the same thing. And the tacos we got from them had nearly half filled with grease. I wouldn't go to this establishment for a while until they fix their "grease" problem.
