S599hCA4kJJO3_b6SRFKoA We had a very disappointing lunch today I ordered a tamale and enchilada and my wife ordered 2  tacos, there was plenty of meat in the tacos but it was very plain and with little flavor, it seemed like it was totally unseasoned, my tamale was extremely dry the corn masa was dried out like it was put in the microwave to be reheated, I had to order sauce to be put over the tamale and the enchilada because of the dryness of both, The enchilada had plenty of chicken in it but absolutely zero seasoning So no flavor plain with nothing inside the enchilada to flavor it and very little sauce on top, for a so called gourmet restaurant this place is a flop i'm sorry but Del taco makes a far better meal than what we had at a much better price.
