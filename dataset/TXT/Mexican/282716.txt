XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Me and my husband had dinner here at the time of opening, which was 5 pm. We arrived about 10 minutes early and had cocktails. I had a refreshing lime citrus martini while waiting and a couple minute prior to service, we were seated. 

For appetizers, we ordered the delicious tiger shrimp roasted garlic corn tamale which had a beautiful balance of flavored. For dinner I had the Ancho-Chile Honey Glazed Salmon that was delicious but I have had salmon taste a bite better than what I had. There was not enough seasoning and the salmon was slightly over cooked. 

My husband had the grilled porterhouse lamb chops which he absolutely could not hush about. He just had so many good things to say about it from the sauce to the accompaniment dish of plantain tamale. He had said that if he were to visit again, this would be the meal on his mind without hesitation. 

We finished off with the crushed blueberry line tart which was a little to tart for my taste. I like subtle and balanced flavors so probably would have enjoyed it with maybe a bit of coconut milk. :)
