0r1Ow0HYAAjU7oM_2ePN6g The food is absolutely wonderful. It makes me look for excuses to go upstreet. I wish they'd have barstools for those who choose to eat there, though, at their two counters. You have to stand and wait, then stand and eat. But the food is amazing. I will return. And return. And return.
