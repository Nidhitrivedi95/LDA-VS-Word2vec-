pup46G8qFBG8695RtbQNwA After 35 minutes, the adults still hadn't received their drinks and 1 of the 2 kids' drinks were incorrect. We sat without being greeted for 20 minutes and that was after 2 different servers came outside and saw we weren't greeted. We had to leave. Server didn't seem too surprised we were leaving. Terrible first, last, and only impression.
