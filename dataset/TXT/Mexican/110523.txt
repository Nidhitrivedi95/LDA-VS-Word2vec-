FxEJjLZj6UdsOCGcgEufeA Thanksgiving is approaching and to celebrate, my office had a holiday potluck today. I wanted my contribution to be something out of the ordinary. Empanadas came to mind. Now, I just needed to find someplace closer than Tucson that makes great empanadas.

Yelp! pointed me towards La Purisima Bakery on Indian School Road. I should probably warn you now, in case you don't read to the bottom of this review. Bring cash. They do not accept plastic. Bring lots of cash! You're going to want one of everything!

Actually, the prices are very reasonable here. The dozen assorted empanadas I purchased cost $10 and change. Comparable to the price of a dozen donuts. But that's not a fair comparison. Donuts don't offer the flavors you can find hiding inside the empanadas at La Purisima!

There was strawberry, cherry, apple, guava, pineapple, pumpkin, peach and cheese. I don't even think I named them all... They were perfect! And they were still warm! Regardless of the filling, the pastry crust was amazing.

The cases at La Purisima were stocked full of familiar items. There were also a few things that I have never seen in a Mexican bakery. That's all the reason I need to go back! Muchas gracias!
