JIfSollg32ifUzTw2K4PDQ I've been to many of the Taqueria El Buen Pastor spots here in Las Vegas, and this one is the BEST by far! I don't live close at all but I make the drive. Love that it's open all the time. Favorite taco spot & I think I'm kind of a taco snob. It's always clean too & it's really impressive for it being a taco truck. The cashiers are always very nice.
