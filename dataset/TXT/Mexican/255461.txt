VCjrZPeRDBNQHq_qFQgclw Andele is my favorite spot for a quick meal at a reasonable price. The service always ranges between good and excellent. The three (yes, three!) complimentary salsas are all great, but a little on the spicy side (they're manageable if you're willing to spend a few bucks on some queso to mix in). Pro tip: either order something with carnitas in it, or substitute whatever meat comes with your dish for it. Soooo good! I'm pretty sure they serve Andele's carnitas in heaven. If they don't, then I never want to die, so I can have it on earth forever.
