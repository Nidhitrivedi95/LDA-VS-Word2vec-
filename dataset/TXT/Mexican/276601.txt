xIYTia1c4IUFxIQlBItasA This is my daughter's favorite restaurant so that gives it a half star extra.  I would go 3.5 myself.  This is typical Wisconsin Mexican Restaurant fare, pretty fresh ingredients, a bit more grease than I think real Mexican food would have.

We love their bean dip to start and they make pretty good burritos and tacos.  The enchiladas are not quite up to par, the flavor is a bit bland on the sauces I've tried and I've tried these multiple times.  I would like to have sauces that have different flavors instead of just different colors, they are not bad but not packed with a lot of punch.  Although that may be why the girls like the place, not too over the top.  

In Mt. Horeb this is as good as a restaurant gets (I'm not including Sjolinds in this club as they are more than a restaurant imho and any time you are in town you should go there), I'm still waiting for a good old supper club to come to town.
