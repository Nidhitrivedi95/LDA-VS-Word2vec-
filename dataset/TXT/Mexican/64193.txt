B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA Came in for a late lunch with my mom. She let me order since she hadn't ever had a sushi burrito. We got an angry salmon and a twin dragon. The angry salmon was great. Fish was fresh and the flavors were good. Could have used a little eel sauce or spicy mayo to push it over the edge to incredible. The twin dragon on the other hand was overly sweet presumably due to too much eel sauce. The minced tuna that was in there wasn't very fresh tasting either so we had to kind of squeeze that out of the roll to make it edible. Soda fountain and four different kinds of peak iced tea. Dining area is basic but clean. Will probably come back to try out the other rolls. This place is more of a teriyaki sushi fusion place than any of the other sushi burrito concepts I've been to so far.
