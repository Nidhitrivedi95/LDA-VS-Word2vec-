9LAXz_VfATZ0kLdaavkN4g Like a one night stand with a half rate hooker--it got the job done but I didn't feel great afterward.  Overpriced taco fare with guacamole that pales in comparison to what I can make at home.  I will say I was amazed at the tequila selection, it's nice to see a place where patron is considered second class (because it should be).  We tried every taco, and the only one I'd write home about was the spicy Mahi.
