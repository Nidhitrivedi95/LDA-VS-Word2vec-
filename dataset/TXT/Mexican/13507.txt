0LP1QdHGn6ZPZPrG9k3DkQ Liked it. Amazing churios and burritos.

Cannot give 5 stars cus I feel the portion size is not as good as other Mexican restaurants I have been to. And that even though the burritos were good but they could have been better.

Otherwise the preparation is good, it's a nicely kept and clean restaurant. Have a variety of things on their menu.

Recommended. Must try this restaurant as it won't fail you.
