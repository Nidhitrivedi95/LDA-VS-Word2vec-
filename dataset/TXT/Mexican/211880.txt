qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A Found this gem during Restaurant Week.  Love the decor and vibe of this place.  Started with the Ahi app.  Please put this on your regular menu!  This was one of the best dishes I have had...ever.  I will come back during the next Restaurant Week just for this dish.  Unfortunately, the next couple courses couldn't live up to the app.  They were good, just not great.  The entree was supposed to be a steak with scallops.  To my surprise, the dish came out with shrimp instead.  As it turned out, they ran out of scallops and substituted the shrimp.  The server should have told me when I ordered.  

Another thing I noticed was that there was two lights out in the restaurant.  It didn't make it dark, but show some attention to detail.

No matter, that appetizer will have me coming back again for another visit in Sept.
