qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A This place was incredible! Where do I begin? Travis, our waiter, was perfect. He was informative, polite & gave great service without being overbearing.  The presentation of the food was so colorful and pretty. The prices were not high considering how much attention to detail this little gem has in store. The menu is full of variety and after taking Travis' suggestion to order the chlaquiles, my palate was HAPPY!  A perfect highlight off the strip after spending too much cash for average meals on the strip. Totally worth the drive... an amazing brunch!!!
