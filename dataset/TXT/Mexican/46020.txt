7Q2cYSl5NBYytJzgjX0oKw The food was pretty good, the drinks are great and the service is outstanding even when busy.  What po'd me was the men's room.  They have lotions, colognes, candy, condoms and CIGARS!!!  You know what the women's room has?  NOTHING!!!  WTF!!!  Not even a cheap bottle of lotion.  I get that men have their wallets with them when they go to the bathroom whereas a lot of time women leave their purses at the table so they may not have any money to tip, but really?  Not even a cheap bottle of lotion?  Won't be back but you are always packed so I'm sure you're not concerned.
