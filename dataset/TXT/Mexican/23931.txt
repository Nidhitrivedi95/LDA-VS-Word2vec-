2QznyHGF0PuiYkrl5RU66A Best Mexican food I've come across and I don't give that type of compliment easy.  
My cousin said his horchata was the best he's ever had.  
Fresh made tortilla chips, street tacos were great.  Fish taco and shrimp taco were A+.
Hell even the lemons were the best I've had(no seeds and fresh)

Seriously nothing to even complain the slightest about

Super nice lady for our waitress and made us feel at home.  

Highly recommended and once you go once you'll be coming back.
