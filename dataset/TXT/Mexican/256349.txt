VH2BjFjc9usDquDgoHhptA Barrio is my favorite casual restaurant downtown. I've been there countless times and I always leave stuffed and satisfied.

The guac and queso with your chips are a must. While cheap, the tacos are very filling and have great flavor. I always recommend newcomers order 2-3 tacos.

The green goddess shell is awesome. I usually pair it with pulled pork, pineapple salsa, cheese, and lettuce. While on the plainer side, it still has a lot of flavor.

The margaritas are sweet and addicting. The peach marg with a sugar rim is my go-to. Can't go wrong with any flavor.

Good selection of beer on tap. (Not my forte, so not a lot to say here)

Anyone new to Cleveland should definitely check out Barrio!
