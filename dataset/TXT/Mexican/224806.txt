RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg Came here for the second time over the weekend and it's still as great as the first time. It was my boyfriends first time coming and he really enjoyed it. We got there around noon and waited about 20 mins in line. We didn't mind the wait because we knew what to expect. The line situation is a little inconvenient because you have to be in a certain line for the kind of meat you want, but since there was two of us we just split up and ordered for each other. The tacos were amazing especially the al pastor. We also got some quesadillas which were EXTRA delicious!!! Wish we had a place like this at home!
