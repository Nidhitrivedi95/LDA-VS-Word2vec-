GGecutXeoEVlYKoxVo2WPA The last few times I've been to this place I've come home only to have the wrong food. I don't live far from here thank God because if I did I would be extremely pissed. Not only do you have to wait at least 20 minutes in line but you get the wrong food. Then when something isn't up to your standards like the nachos my husband received that were soggy and all clumped together the manager yells at you. I asked for a refund and she told me to bring them back and they would give us new ones. Then they told us that they would be there until 10p and it was 9:50p so we said screw it because I didn't want to drive all the way back for them to not even open the door. The people that own this place have no customer appreciation. They literally do not care. The food is slowly going downhill but is still decent. The people that work here are the rudest employees and managers I've ever encountered.
