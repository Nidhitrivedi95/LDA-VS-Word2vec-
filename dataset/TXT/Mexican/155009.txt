K-uQkfSUTwu5LIwPB4b_vg Why have I lived in Scottsdale for as long as I have and not been to this treasure? The food is fantastic, service is great and atmosphere is lively and interesting.

Upscale Mexican food done tastefully well. Try their delicious margaritas!

Pork tacos were to die for... Steak tacos are to die for... I'm being repetitious -- just get your tail there and try the dishes for yourself. Prices are good and food will make you come back for more!
