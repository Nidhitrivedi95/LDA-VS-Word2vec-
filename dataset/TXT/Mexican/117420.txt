gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw We really enjoyed our brunch here. There were a lot of gluten-free options and the arepas are gf now! We loved the arepas- of course they are not traditional but if that doesn't bother you then you'll probably enjoy them. They come in really nice flavors- cheese, beetroot, cilantro, and black bean. The beetroot and cilantro taste like you are eating an actual beetroot and a bunch of cilantro which, for us, was fantastic. The black bean and cheese ones are very good too. They are a little greasy but still very good. We would love to see ones stuffed with meat in the future. We ate them so fast and they were so filling that we didn't eat much of our main dishes. I had the huevos rancheros and my partner had the steak tacos. Both meals tasted very good but not as great as the arepas. The huevos rancheros had too much cheese for me but other than that it was well made. The steak tacos had a lot going on within the taco so we didn't get very much steak. The flavor was good and the rice and beans were fine. 

Our servers were very nice, accommodating, and attentive. We will definitely come back.
