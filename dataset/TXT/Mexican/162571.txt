I had the chicken mole enchiladas and the mole tacos. The beans are fresh, and taste great with the queso fresco and the table salsas are good. Horchata was good as well. Not a strong cinnamon flavor which I like. Some places put way to much spice in their horchata, but this was good. 

I knew I was in the right place with the novella on the tv and I was the only gringo in the joint :).
