jqAdZf9PJo8lsRskc6T1Sw We live in Chicago & always look forward to eating at Los Olivos. Just arrived & went immediately to eat our favor entree which is the enchiladas with onions # 3 with mucho green sauce. Unfortunately the sauce had to much flour & not enough green & was short on taste! Very disappointed & probably won't go back again!!
