3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ Wonderful experience! The restaurant is in a beautifully renovated old Methodist church that has been there since 1893. The bar is in the original altar! 
The service is impeccable and so is the food. I recommend the chipotle cherry steak tacos.  The bar manager Sam was on the floor making sure everybody was taken care of. We asked I'm a few questions regarding the building and what tequila we should try he was very knowledgeable and personable. 
We are looking forward to our next visit!
