DljmXW8D07LVTA1Y69xosw So we come here to order. We order and they hand us our cups to fill up our drinks. The people were somewhat short with me when I asked if they had any cups for the salsa bar. She points at one line cup about the size of a medicine cup. The chips are mediocre store bought chips. He salsa is very good, the enchiladas were very good. My carne asada was decent but dry. If you're Mexican they brink your drinks to you. I'm not a discriminator and hate discrimination. It doesn't feel nice on our end either.
