eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg Met up a few friend here for brunch, this place in chill, nice and up beat. Art work inside of ten restaurant and on the walls outside were great. I ordered From their brunch menu Huevos con chorizo, and ordered Home made lemonade. I loved everything and food tasted wonderful. The staff was be ray friendly and up beat as well.

2 minor issues I had with this place ere the following:

- food portion for brunch was small, compared to other places around town.
- initially I wanted an Arnold palmer and I was told that I'll be charged twice for that since the lemonade is home made lemonade, and they mix it with iced tea. Didn't make sense to me so I went with just the lemonade, which was great. 

Would definitely come back. Good food for sure.
