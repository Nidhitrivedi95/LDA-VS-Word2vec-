Y46qmlks-TjEtJDXnUMsxw See "Bob L" review posted on 12/29/2012.  It's a spot-on review.

Tacos al pastor are the real, yummy deal.
Most freakin' fantastic refried beans EVER.

Odd colored 1800 margaritas....suprisingly good and the odd color must have been efforts to jazz-up a margarita mix.  VERY good BANG FOR the BUCK.

Owners/staff have pride -- the joint is clean, service is prompt and all the items ordered were fresh.

Will return!
