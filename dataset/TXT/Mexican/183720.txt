NOfbzTpQ7hrt6ZbJVeXUUw Not so good on the taste of the food. The place and service are casual. Waitress brought my check, though I didn't finish eating and didn't ask for it. It was a quiet Monday and there was no reason to bring the check, AND THEN ASK if I wanted anything else.... Come on. 

Anyway, service aside, the menu is decent. Starters go for about $8 each, took the nachos and the Loco Salad. Disappointing. The nachos came smeared with craft spread and not real melted cheese. Overall below average. The salad looked lame.

Sorry Loco, I wanted to love you, but it didn't go that way :-(

Bill total: margarita + nachos + salad = $25

Personally I won't be back.
