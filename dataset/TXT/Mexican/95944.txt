The guacamole is made table side to your taste and so fresh and delicious, tortillas are hand made, margaritas are perfect and not too sweet. Our dishes were very authentic and cooked perfectly. Everything was so delicious! We plan on going back again and again to work our way through this very unusual menu. Cascor and Manny gave delightful and professional service. This truly is the best Mexican restaurant we've eaten at anywhere in Las Vegas.
