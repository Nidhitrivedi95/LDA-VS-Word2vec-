kxzS-zh5nUNvBzYz2Q47pg We are guests at the Boulders.  We called in advance and asked if they had a happy hour.  They said it was ending in 30 min and urged us to get there soon.  We did -- we arranged a ride and hurried over.  It was hot, but we made it.  

When we arrived we were seated at a table.  We then asked for the happy hour menu and the waiter... REFUSED! He said the happy hour menu was only for those privileged few who had a *bar stool*. 

A bar stool? Everybody is in the same tiny restaurant,  ordering drinks from the same tiny bar, but only those handful of people plopped on bar stools get drinks?

What a crock.  Won't be back.  Won't recommend to others.  

Is this worth it to you, Spotted Donkey?  So rude.
