R54Sh5Y3zjtZt7MjdfwDZA I have been frequenting this Rubio's for years and have always loved it! However I just ordered a large order of guacamole, which I was told came in "a 12oz bowl." When I received the order, the woman said she was sorry but she misspoke. No problem, misunderstandings happen all the time. However when I got home and saw the guac, there were 3 of the tiny cups they put the pinto beans in and they weren't even half full of guacamole! I probably could have fit the entire contents of my "large" order in one small cup! With that being said, besides today I have always had a great experience here and will continue to come here-- I just won't order any more guacamole.
