J5ebC7fKqrSF8KuS8d6hgw I forgot just how amazing this place is!  I had visited for dinner nearly 10 years ago and hadn't been back since...what was I thinking?  We stopped in for Sunday brunch and love the rustic and relaxed atmosphere, fantastic service and amazingly flavorful food.  I enjoyed the stacked enchilada special with red chile pork and a pineapple agua fresca...seriously amazing way to start the morning!
