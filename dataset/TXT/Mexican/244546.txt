TjziWy83MOEkWDiO07RwRA Terrible service. I ordered one thing and another came. I wasn't told by staff what would come with the food, since the menu doesn't describe it either. Therefore, the "just tacos" came with so much more I didn't want. I ordered water and I was forced to accept bottled water, so there was a charge for that without warning. Food was terrible. Family and I ate the courtesy chips until we were full.
