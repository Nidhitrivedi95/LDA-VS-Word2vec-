B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA Excellent concept...it works so well! Appreciated the option to create your own or go with a menu burrito. I had the lion king and it was delicious. Friendly to all sorts of appetites and dietary restrictions. I was also pleased with the price and their staff who worked quickly to get people through the line. Will be back!
