rbYh1ue3YpdOt1GIUs2YBg So this all started wondering why the Hell was there so many cars at the bike shop.  When we realized that there was a taco trailer there we had no choice but to stop.   I am so glad we did!  The food was outstanding and the salsa was even better.  However all that said, it was the handmade corn tortillas that were the topper.  Great meal great service.  Another foodie bucket list item!!!!
