OFaMjL9nLF-A51KHNW8nfg Crave Cantina carries the same warm glow as it's sister restaurant in Akron. The interior is nicely done with lots of color, glassworks, exposed bricks, ironwork, and rough wood. The drinks were creative and nicely sized. I was extremely disappointed that all of the salsas were so hot!  I was told by the server that the watermelon one wasn't hot despite habanero being listed as an ingredient. We tried it in our salsa trio. The flavor was great, and I wanted to share salsa with my three year old "foodie".  I gave him a couple of bites, until I ate something SO HOT I ALMOST CRIED. Thank God my son didn't get that in his bite!  I loathe when restaurants have only spicy salsas. They could easily make the same batches, put hot peppers in half of the batch, and leave some without the heat. 

The tacos are small, so I ordered another one because I didn't eat the chips and salsa after my tastebuds were  set on fire. Spent a lot for lunch and my son and I were not full when we left.
