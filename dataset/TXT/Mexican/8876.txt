_u1Bq7QsgMUXSMex8QHqLQ I haven't been here in years and decided to give it a try because its right beside my school. Food was awesome, I got the shrimp and chicken mix naked bowl it was so so so so good!!! I skimped out on the hot sauce this time, but I think I'll add it next time. Definitely worth your buck, they pile it on. So close to school, definitely will be going back. 

However I was in a rush to get home and I ate just a bit as soon as I got it (its so good fresh), but had to take mine back home with me on my commute. They have these biodegradable boxes which didn't really survive the trip home -- it got soggy. 

Service was a little slow, looked like they were training new employees, so it was understandable. But I did notice that they have a pre-order option, and some guy claimed he ordered 20 minutes ago and his food still wasn't even started... I ordered way after him and even got my stuff first. Probably wouldn't suggest the pre-order option, but the food is so good!

Update: I went again, this time it definitely wasn't filled as much, nor did it taste as good as the first time I reviewed it, but I'd still go back for sure.
