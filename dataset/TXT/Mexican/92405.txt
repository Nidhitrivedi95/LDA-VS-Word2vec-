e13SEvJud_vgeDR_doL4sQ Just the two of us went in for some appetizers and drinks at the bar.  The homemade salsa and fresh guacamole were spot on.  Behind the bar, Mike was entertaining and made the margaritas how I like them:  fresh squeezed lime, a lot of tequila and a little bit of love.  We split the fish tacos and each had an ice cold Tecate.  Freshly made tacos!  Anyone looking for a relaxed place to eat with great food and a fun atmosphere before hitting a show or a club, Hussong's is well worth it.  We'll be back!
