cwCLcQns_SSExsBCzWNQDA Quite a disappointment. I ordered a chicken burrito and it was incredibly bland and dry, the only flavor was from the grilled onions which tasted burnt. I ordered the queso and it was so salty I couldn't eat it- it tasted like the lid to the salt shaker fell off when they made the queso! I would not ever think of going back here.
