I only had to wait a few minutes for them to prepare some fresh salsa, but the server apologized for the wait and offered me free guacamole, sour cream, etc. Not only is the service sincere and efficient, but they give you a generous helping of beans and rice. I ordered the single tamale and it was extremely filling!
