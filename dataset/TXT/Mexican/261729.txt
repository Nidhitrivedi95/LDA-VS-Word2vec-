vvHr2uKKIhfxVk-fYDmX9Q This Del Taco is SO slow. I come here to get my food quickly and go, not wait in the drive through for 40 minutes just to get my food. I've been here twice but never again. If I wanted to wait this long I'd go sit down at a restaurant. At least give people some compensation for waiting that long. I've tried to be understanding but this is ridiculous.
