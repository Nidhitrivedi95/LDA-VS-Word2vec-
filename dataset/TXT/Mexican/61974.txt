AVA3AwMEHfLY9anV3WgDXA $2 for a small extra side of pinto beans? Are you serious? Are these chicken or bat wings. Literally no meat.  Wth??? Let me guess... el pollo waits for the chicken to die and then buys for cheap and marinates it well enough to the point that people dont know.  Genius!!

Service is fast and fairly polite.  Prices... eh... had better.  The mac  and cheese is good. 

The chicken is really low quality tbh. Sides are decent.
