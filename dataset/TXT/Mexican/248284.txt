u7jiuYiz-zVwsh0TGRHUIg I ordered from Burrito King via GrubHub a few nights ago. Food arrived hot and the portions are massive! My husband got the Burrito King, seriously it's huge, can easily feed 2 people. Also ordered the enchiladas supremas which weren't bad, it was terribly messy though in its container, it's I think 5 different enchiladas, couldn't tell which was which, too much sauce too. Steak fajitas were good, again very large portion, you'll need extra tortillas. I would order or dine in again.
