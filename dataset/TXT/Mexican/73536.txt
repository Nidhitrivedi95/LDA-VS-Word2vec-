cfSuc4q7pQLF28mMbx1MRg This food was great. I had two tacos. One beef, one chicken. Fantastic. I would have never known about this place if I wasn't invited. I usually go downtown for my Mexican food and was telling my friends about it. Then the food showed up and it was probably the best Mexican food I have ever had. If you don't like this place, you don't like authentic Mexican food. They have a good stock of tequila as well.
