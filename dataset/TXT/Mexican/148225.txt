jS3U9iEGnJY7j5oT9iDN7A I'm a fan! We went on a busy Saturday night but avoided the wait by sitting at the bar. Great service and food at the bar, so why wait for a table? I had a great margarita but it was mostly ice, really, I watched him make it. The treat was the green chili stew! Go get it! It comes with warm tortillas and it is tasty!
