nUfeYJ_YEaDzggPKnYry3g I give this one star only because the queso fundido was the saving grace.  Got there around noon today, place wasn't busy at all.  Took forever for anyone to come to the table, then again to get drink order and drinks.  Had to send back my fountain drink because it tasted super funky.  We are salsa aficianados and had our own salsa company so we were quite disappointed with the awful sweet green salsa and what tasted like jarred red grocery store salsa with sugar added.  The food wasn't much better.  Everything arrived lukewarm.  It was such a disappointment.  I ate only one of my two enchiladas and couldn't bring myself to eat the other one.  The service was appalling.  I was never offered sugar or sweetener for my tea, we were never asked how the food was and were basically ignored the entire time other than when our server had to bring something to the table.  We tried this place because it always seems busy when we go next door to eat Chinese food.  Can't figure out why.  Our $50 lunch wasn't worth half that.  Won't be going back.
