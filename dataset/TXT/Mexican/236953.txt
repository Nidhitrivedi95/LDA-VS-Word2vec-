SW6ZQk22G1_CV81_gfnvNQ The only reason I wanted to write this is because I feel like their attitude towards "not changing the menu" needs to improve.       

Do not come to this restaurant if you do not like cilantro. They do not alter their menu to omit a particular thing you detest. Seriously, I hate cilantro, I wish I could love it because I do love Mexican food, but I can't. 

I get it, customizing orders is a pain and you believe the food tastes better the way that you make it. But let me tell you, not everyone likes what you like. And I don't think it's that hard to tell me what foods on your menu do not have cilantro, or what foods you can omit cilantro from? Instead of telling me "we don't change the menu, unless you have an allergy" I guess I should have said I was allergic. And like "just pick it off" well I would rather you just NOT put it on there in the first place?

That being said, even though I did not eat any dinner because I was promised "there's so little cilantro you won't be able to taste it" which I did. Thank you for that... The churros were delicious, the atmosphere was nice, and everyone in the party I was with (who have no problem with cilantro) REALLY enjoyed their food. 

Honestly, the service was great and I'm sure you guys are about a 5 star to everyone else in my group, but I just couldn't judge because I couldn't eat. And I'm really sad about that. I really wanted to eat those beautiful looking tacos.
