r8Jr-7YfkhJL2nxk9lxUNg When you walk into a Mexican restaurant and see nothing but white people, that's usually a bad sign. Totally not racist at all, but Mexican restaurants with nothing but white customers usually means very non authentic crappy food. Some people will understand what I meant right there haha! Anyway, to my surprise the food was great. And the service was excellent! I'm only knocking off 1 star because I wasn't a huge fan of the chips & salsa.
