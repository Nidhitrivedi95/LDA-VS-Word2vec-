A nice clean restaurant and I really like the floor plan. 
I ordered 1 off  the hook taco  it was delicious, but next time I'm going to order it on a flour tortilla as I'm not really a fan of the corn ones. I also ordered 1 tree hugger taco, it was different and good, but something was a little salty and we all know I'm not a fan of salt.

11/22
I had to change my rating from a 4 star to a 3 star.
I ordered the off-the-hook taco on the flour tortilla and I felt like the fish was too fishy. I ordered chips and queso, which was average. I may give this place one more try with a bowl but I'm on the fence.
