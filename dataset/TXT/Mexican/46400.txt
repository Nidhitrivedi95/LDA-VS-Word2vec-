7QThNKBZfCNDsCaWRoejMw Served in a very modern looking atmosphere, full of stainless steel (which lacks any sort of Mexican feel at all.) The burrito is made with fresh ingredients and is extremely large and filling. The rice was very crunchy and undercooked. I found the burritos bland and lacking flavour. The corn salsa certainly had flavour and the guacamole was bitter. The hot sauces aren't well marked. Some are fruity instead of being spicy. Water seems to be rationed.
