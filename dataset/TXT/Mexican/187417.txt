O1ird5yRyuDFnOmYu90OoA I gave this place 4 stars because it is the best Mexican food I have had in Pittsburgh.   The service is very good considering the volume of customers they cater to and the atmosphere/environment is very appropriate.  Where I feel they fall short, is their limited menu.  I understand that it is a very casual restaurant-- it feels like it is intended to be a great place to go to meet friends after work or on a weekend night to grab a drink and get a *quick* bite to eat. Round Corner has the potential to be so much more... and Diners recognize that. Instead of getting a quick bite to eat with their drinks, they end up going there just for the food, or they end up making a night of it and hand out there for long hours.  They have and enormous back patio and it is awesome to sit back their on summer nights.  So I guess that is my complaint: "You Could be so much more 'Round Corner'!" Expand the menu, focus just as much on the food as on the drinks, don't approach diner's as if they are their just to be at a bar (I go there to get food all of the time, and skip the drink).
In terms of what I have enjoyed on their menu... 5 Stars for each of the following: The Salsa, Guacamole, Beef Birria Tacos, Lamb Barbacoa Rolled Tacos, Pescado Tacos. 4.5 Stars for the following: Potato Rolled Tacos, Pollo Pibil Tacos
