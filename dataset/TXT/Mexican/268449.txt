wMNDGq6c5iN9tiIplpfjhg I'm only giving this one star because I was forced to...this restaurant doesn't even deserve that. I went to this restaurant with two people, we were the only people in there. Our waitress brought us a tiny serving of a bowl of salsa and chips, and then took our order. A minute later she comes back to clarify what I had just told her I wanted (she probably should have written down our orders). So, we finish our chips and salsa and our drinks and just sit there waiting...wondering where our waitress went. My friend looks over at the bar and sees our waitress sitting down, talking to the bartender, and having herself a liquor drink. Needless to say we left. If the quality of their service is any indication of the quality of their food then I'm glad we left when we did.
