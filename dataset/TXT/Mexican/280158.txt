xWpy6al-9u02BZz00Kbbyg THE END ALL OF MEXICAN FOOD!!!!!!!!

This place is just too good. Really! Before I even got to my food I was served with the best chips and salsa ever. My husband is a pro bodybuilder and is super strict with his diet, he couldn't stop lol. The chips are made fresh and the salsa...... oh the salsa. If I could just drink that stuff up i would. they should really think about bottling it and selling it.  I then got a house salad. The dressing was this great cilantro dressing that they make there, my husband got a tortilla soup. Both great but I especially liked the house dressing. When dinner came I had the pollo sarandieado or at least I think thats how its spelled lol. Chicken breast with a white spicy sauce. Im not a spicy type but the flavor was REMARKABLE! My husband got steak fajitas. I didnt try the steak but I ate all of his veggies and they were delicious, oh ya and the beans! Its hard to find a place that they dont just taste like you bought them at the store. They make them fresh here and you can taste it!!
