fK1oj0dk9Bc6KsBk5mMDxg I'm so happy this place opened up!

I had the pork carnita burrito (huge, I recommend sharing),the octopus tacos to start (delicious, but tiny portion) and some sort of margarita pitcher (great, not too sweet). 

The atmosphere is fun and lively, and the service is friendly. After hmmming and haaahing thinking of our waistlines and deciding against getting churros for dessert, the waitress brought them to us on the house. Can't say no to that! They were hot and fresh. 

Can't wait to return!
