HWl2EbZhkhAkFgqt44yUkA This place is fine is you just realize one thing: you are eating in a bar. It's a bar as in a LOUD, drunk people galore, people jumping up to sing karaoke, it's hard to get the wait staff people's attention, full on bar. 

The entire wait staff is really young, (who else could stand the noise level in this place?). The food was actually pretty good. I had the tostada salad which was good but the chicken was cold. My hubs had the fajitas and he told me the same thing: cold chicken. 

If you want to dine and still be able to speak to your dining companion and not just resort to reading lips, eat on the patio. We had to wait about a half hour but it's so worth it. You know, sitting in here, looking at the bar scene reminds me just how effing glad I am that I'm not a youn'in anymore and I don't have to prowl these types of places trying to find ...er....I'm not sure WHAT I was trying to find way back when...all I know is that I never found it in places like Senor Frogs. 

Our waiter was really nice but the place was super busy so it took some time to get some menus. No problem, I realize Thanksgiving weekend will be packed anywhere you go.
