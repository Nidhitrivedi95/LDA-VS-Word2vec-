JsCKeWHA8n_5mFQ3F6t4UA This was my first time coming to this restaurant. The service was bad and slow. My order was delivered wrong, and we were never approached during our meal to see if we needed anything else or a refill on our drinks. They forgot our request for more salsa twice and the overall experience was not great at all. The overall food quality was not that good either. Some of my food was cold, but I was too hungry to send it back. I would not recommend this place to others, and I will not be coming back.
