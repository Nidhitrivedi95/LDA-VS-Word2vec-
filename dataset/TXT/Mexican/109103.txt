FrT9Ij-uK4yjesnIoGSJrw This a wonderful Mexican restaurant, where the motto is "no tex-mex".  In keeping with that sentiment, the food seems very authentic. I'd recommend getting the guacamole as a starter; it's incredibly fresh and tasty. The enchiladas are a real surprise too. 

A small room, with big taste.
