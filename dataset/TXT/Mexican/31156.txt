4gO38_nlrPCHqEcs_6-AAg Stopped in for "Taco Tuesday" happy hour and had a pretty good time.  

The "2-for-1 draft beer special" was great!  The selection of draft beers ranged from PBR (which ain't all that bad!) to very tasty wheat beers.  I ordered 3 tacos; Duck Confit, Roasted Pork and Potato and Hanger Steak...all with soft shells.  They were all very tasty, the meats were all tender, juicy and full of flavor.  The Pork taco also had these great, salty lardons of bacon that should just be made into it's own "Bacon Taco!" Very good.

Just a few, minor complaints.  First,  I like to pick up tacos and eat them.  They're meant to be eaten with your hands.  The soft shell tacos are more of an open-faced sandwich/small salad, very hard to eat "out of hand."  Secondly, is that the soft shells appeared to be just normal, soft flour tortilla shells.  I could be wrong, but I'm not sure that they weren't just store-bought flour tortillas.  Sure hope i'm wrong on that one. Finally, I'd like to see a read, dedicated website with a menu posted, as opposed to a Facebook fan page.  That's just kinda lame...

Previous reviews were critical of the staff, so I was braced for bad service.  They've clearly made changes in this department.  The hostess was very friendly, while our waiter, Antonio, was very helpful, offering suggestions, and was attentive without being "TGI Fridays" annoying.

All around, a pretty good dining experience.
