eJPckkV1k7gn0V2awA1pzA Chef John has done it again. He is kicking ass and taking names. This establisment is barely a block away from his original Soho Sushi Restaurant. So you can eat here for lunch then run over there for dinner :)

I love how they expanded on the concept of sushi burritos to bowls. They listened to what the customers had to say and studied what they were ordering. They realized that they had an opportunity to grow their fan base so they capitalized and executed successfully.

I love that when you order the poke bowls, they mix everything into a bowl with the sauces, vegetables and protein before putting it back on the rice instead of just plopping each ingredient onto the rice right away. This gives a more thorough flavor for what they are trying to achieve with the pre-made menu or by building your own. They also brought over their burrito menu from the Sahara location so I can continue ordering my burritos double decker style ;)

They have also added grilled chicken, ginger beef chashu pork belly, grilled steak, grilled salmon and grilled shrimp to the menu if you want to skip the fish and try a teriyaki bowl instead. I don't know when I'll ever end up trying these since I love their fresh fish so damn much but one of these days I'll probably just order multiple items.
