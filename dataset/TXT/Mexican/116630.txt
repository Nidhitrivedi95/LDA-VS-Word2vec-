gkeGCryFC7z2vlFSDdKH0g You know what, I love Chipotle. It's way better than Qdoba, and let's not talk about Mad Mex anymore ever again. You probably don't need a rundown on the menu items, but their guacamole is amazing (pure avocado with minimal extras), their chips are thin and salty and lime-y, and everything else is pretty darn good. I don't love the chicken or the steak, but that's just because I prefer shredded, slow-cooked meat to go with my salsa.

My current favorite thing is just to go with the salad, with pinto beans, carnitas (the only meat there that isn't cooked in soybean oil, just FYI), as much of the pico, tomatillo, and hot salsas as they'll give me, and some cheese. Filling and way less carbs than the burritos, as good as those are. The dressing (a citrus cilantro of some sort) is pretty good too, though you won't need much with that salsa on there.

This location is pretty good; they only rarely turn out overstuffed burritos that split down the side, and they're fast. One of the gals recognizes me and gets the guacamole ready ahead of time, which I always appreciate. The seating area is reasonably accommodating, unless you get there at the same time as an entire Little League team, and they do have patio seating in nicer weather. Parking is easy; getting in and out, not as much, but it's McKnight road, so what can you do?

Heads up: Their exterior door is, for some reason, absurdly heavy, so just be aware of that so you don't look like a putz, as I often manage to do.
