Oto60yDwk1z72WmfWEYrjg The food is great, the service is horrid. We've been sitting at the bar for over an hour now. We were offered 1 drink each, and forget about checking back for refills. We waited with empty glasses for around 15min waiting for 1 of the 2 bartenders to notice. Neither did. They were too busy talking to each other and ignoring the patrons sitting at the bar. The bar was not full. Maybe 1/2. What has you so incredibly engrossed in yourselves to the point you're oblivious to your customers needs. 

I finally flagged 1 down after several attempts for a refill
