Bf2fuqWbHd3L-X69FSMvmg Nice little spot at the end of Augusta Ave.  El Trompo doesn't "trumpo" the competition but what they lack in quality and fixings they make up for in quantity.  It's hard to compare this place to the likes of 7 Lives but it sure has it's appeal.  I'll give these guys a 3/5 because the guac was creamy, fresh and had a hint of onion.  The chicken taco was a bit dry but adding the side order of guac and "green sauce" helped.
