EvDUi_H6-JG3QfGWiInAlw I really can't understand why people bitch so much about this place...Word of advice, don't go when they're crazy busy!  Great Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner selections!  Generally good service!  The Tiramisu is an excellent dessert choice!  The $3.99 Eggs my way breakfast can't be beat for the price.  Your drink is included, and most people eating in there use comps like myself.  The Wildhorse Pass salad is terrific, as is the Club Sandwich, Hot Roast Beef Sandwich, Fish N Chips, Prime Rib on Friday... This Place is good, way too many naysayers!
