tjw1yJdmatifLYHbsI9HGA I would not surprised if a whistle blower would reveal that By the Way only hires skinny servers. It is so crowded that I can hear the conversation from the other table. They were talking about nasty in laws....shhh... 

I am not really a fan of this place. 

The food is adequate. Not bad. Not good. Adequate. I have been many times for brunch and it has yet to impress me. And I am not hard to please. Ask my friends. 

The wait staff though is friendly and try to squeeze in between the small gaps between tables. There's a patio outside overlooking the impressive Bloor Street! 

Visit if you want a sit down diner and if you want to hear other people talk about their lives...
