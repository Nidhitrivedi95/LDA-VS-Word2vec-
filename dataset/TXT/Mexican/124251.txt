HoLRI8TigyvNfIHdQ4ChDA I went to this Taco Bell today and it took 15 minutes to order the food at the drive thru and honestly im not sure whether to blame the employee or the headsets Taco Bell provides for their drive thru. I told the lady 3 times I wanted a brisk half and half as my drink and I still got the wrong drink. This was around 1:30. She even forgot to give me my drinks until I reminded her. It was just terrible service over all. And the chips for the nachos were stale.
