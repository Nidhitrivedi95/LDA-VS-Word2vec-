yz66FIUPDKGhILDWzRLeKg I have now been here 2 times and had the same experience.  Food and service are good, but don't come here in a rush.  Service, although good, is SLOOOOOOWWWWW and sometimes hard to get a hold of your server.  I liked the food I had, mainly the Sopapilla.  The Burrito my daughter had was also good.  My girlfriend's medium rare cheeseburger was cooked to hockey puck.  The chill's are good, as should be for New Mexican Cuisine.  

Clean and VERY COOL atmosphere.  All in all, I like it and would go here, but I don't think it would be my go to.
