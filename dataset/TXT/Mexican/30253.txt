46hnat0aLao-qYWZkN9aBg Authentic and Delicious!  This was the first visit for everyone in my group (5) and we were all impressed with the food, drinks, service and the decor.  Food had lots of flavor - the portion sizes were generous (several of us just kept eating even though we were full because the food was just so good).  The prices are reasonable.  Several staff waited on us and everyone was great.  Heather was out waitress and when she learned it was out first time, she told us about the other locations, the history of the restaurant, etc. - built a 'relationship'.  This is not in my part of town but it's worth the drive and I'll be returning soon!
