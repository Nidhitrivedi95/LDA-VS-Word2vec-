This "restaurant" is by far one of the most foul-smelling, looking and run down places I have ever seen.  I didn't even want to eat my food off the plate. This is NOT Mexican food. It's a joke.
I ordered "tacos" and I had a hair that was about 12 inches long that I had to pull out of my mouth like a magician, pulling out that rainbow paper from their throat. 
To me, this place reminds me of the part in the Movie Accepted.  Jonah Hill walks into this gross, grungy, beat down, run down nasty-looking building:  "This place is awesome because now I can  finally get hepatitis."
"I hope you have hobo stab insurance."
"Great! The birthplace of crack!"
"I don't wanna be here when the walls start to bleed"
I wish I could paint you guys a better picture of the establishment... But this is the best I got!
