HWl2EbZhkhAkFgqt44yUkA This is just yet another overpriced chain type restaurant on the Las Vegas strip with sub par food and under poured over priced drinks. The fajitas were okay but there was nothing exciting about them. The chicken included with them and on the taco salad was good quality, but as for the veggies and fixings, not so much. I'm convinced the cheese used as topping was craft because it had that pre shredded waxy coating. Also the salad mix was fresh out of a bag. Definitely not worth it when you are paying so much for a salad. You are paying for the atmosphere for sure because it is in a cool location, but that was the only exciting part about this establishment.
