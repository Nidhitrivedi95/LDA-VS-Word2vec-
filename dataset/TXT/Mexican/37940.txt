6-lmL3sC-axuh8y1SPSiqg I went to Robertos after church and ordered a Torta, I specifically asked for NO ONIONS, even the little girl next to me repeated it to the people behind the counter. I hate onions from a bad experience as a child! And I really feel like they put extra on the Torta just to be rude! I had to have my granddaughter help me pick them off. What an awful experience all around
