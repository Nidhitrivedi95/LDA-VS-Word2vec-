wlm9HjyeW20anJ-kVEMY6g Ordered a Cali burrito and a torta both with pastor. I had the torta and did not especially care for it. The pastor meat had a bit of sweetness to it which was different and disliked. There was too much flavor going on overall and it just didn't mix well. It was kinda like a mush sandwich (due to the beans and soft tomatoes) with sweetened dog food meat. The sandwich was huge tho, could only eat half. I'd probably stick with the simpler menu item like tacos and get anything but pastor.
