Rj-7ymdw8aNZBRqGRAjR3Q I agree with most of the other reviews.  a fun place, good service but where I differ is with their advertised line about their food being like it is across the border.  It is nothing like being in Mexico unless you go to an Americanized mexican restaurant there.. Read the other reviews, tacos, fajitas, rice and beans, guacomole, overpriced margaritas.  I can find that all over Las Vegas and you can probably find that in your home town.

The decor is fun but very noisy as it is open to the street.  The place is overpriced, well maybe not for the strip but based on the food it is too expensive for us to want to return and we even had a travelzoo discount.

Don't be fooled, this is a classic, chain-style mexican restaurant.  You can pay half as much, get bigger drinks and enjoy yourself as much at lots of other places.  I do want to say the service was great.
