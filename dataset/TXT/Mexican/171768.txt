MAuSh7NKoT__CQ4BumoayA Love this place...the set up, the atmosphere, beautiful. A little high priced for tacos, but it's all good. I love everything, Luxor, of course. It's one of my favorite places to visit!! The tacos are delicious.  Id probably be able to eat like 3 plates tho..lol.  But the tacos have a lot of meat..All in all, a high recommendation here. It's all worth it. One of my favorite places to take a bite on the strip, definitely....
