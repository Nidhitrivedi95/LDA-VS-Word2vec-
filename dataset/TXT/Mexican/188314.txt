o6Yor6ofIw2TqM3mN28Kzg The tacos here are honestly perfection. I ordered 2 beef tacos and they were so, so good. I recommend getting hard shell tacos because my friend got soft tacos and said she liked the hard shells better. 

The only thing I don't like about this place is that I ended up spending $12 for only 2 tacos and I was still left hungry afterwards so I recommend getting something on the side.
