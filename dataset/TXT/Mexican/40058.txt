6ockUmdOBYBApEsUCJkBzA I grew up in Southern California and was freaking out about finding tamales for Xmas here in CU.  El Oasis cured my homesickness with awesome chicken, pork, and cheese tamales for $1.50 each.  I had some New Mexican red chile sauce and avocado to eat them with and it was almost like being back home, at least for my tastebuds.
