Broke my own rule by going to a new restaurant in the first few months-but it was worth it. Not a fan of tequila in general but got into the spirit of Barrio and had a couple fru-fru margarita's (El Diablo?) Amazing!  We split a chorizo queso dip; ordered a second margarita; then did the Happy Dog and built two tacos.  Went for the flour tortilla ( I'm ashamed of myself as well) and mixed up the protein...chorizo and beef brisket.  I can't remember what else I put on there because by that time I had a good start on my second drink...hence the tequila ninja's.  Whatever it was, I made some very wise choices.  Sides of black beans and pickled veg topped off the meal, and at the urging of our server, an order of sopapilla chips. Holy crap! Fried and topped with honey, cinnamon, and sugar...er ma gerhd...we devoured the bag.
Signs all over the place say "Brunch Coming Soon" and soon cannot come fast enough for me.
