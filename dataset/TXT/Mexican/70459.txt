BxRsg5YTYnxXEhoGcabydg Im all for supporting local vendors and trying new things, but I was highly disappointed w my meal. I got a veggie burrito w guac. It was big, but kinda bland. The tomatoes in the pico did not taste very fresh. The service was great, but the guac was an extra $2 and looked more like green cream than guacamole. If it would have been delicious, I wouldn't have cared, but $8 for the burrito plus extra for guac...i expected more flavor, more wow!The tortilla was good, but I ended up throwing the last half of the burrito away. It just wasn't good enough to keep eating. I guess I'm used to being spoiled by free guac w veggie burritos at chipotle. Next time I want to pay less and love my meal, I'll go there.
