zSQs_cDOOyjnTHREy9yRfQ I have been to Fresco's three times since it has opened in October. Now, considering the fact that I live in Akron and its location is in Kent, that shows the effort I have gone to get my dose of their freshly made tex-mex and salsa bar. 

Your first thought walking in, I reluctantly admit, is that you are at a chain restaurant. A well designed flow and layout of the rest, along with a well branded theme. (I appreciate these thing due to my marketing background).  But when you find out that this is a locally owned restaurant, you will appreciate the effort that went into the decor.  You begin to think that they know what they are doing in the restaurant biz. It makes you a little more optimistic about what food might be waiting an the end of the line. The art is also very cool and it has a open and relaxing layout.

I was pretty impressed with the food.  The menu has something for everyone.  I have had the quesadilla, the Santa Fe Tacos(awesome double shell taco), Queso Dip (very good), and a variety of their freshly made salsas. I think my favorite was the fruit salsa.  It had mango and pineapple and a little heat too.  YUM! And you can't forget about dessert, unless, like me in many instances, you have overstuffed your face. They have the best Key Lime pie I have ever had.  At it's all made fresh, daily.  

I just wish this place was located closer to Akron because it would get the nod over any Tex Mex restaurant in this neck of the woods.
