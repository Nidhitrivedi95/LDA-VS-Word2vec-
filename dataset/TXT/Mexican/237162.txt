SW6ZQk22G1_CV81_gfnvNQ Guys, I've been back countless times since my last review and have to say La Carnita serves up the best Mexican in the city. It beats out Grand Electric and Playa Cabana. It's so good. Such a fun atmosphere and the food tastes great and is always consistent. I Iove their daily specials and the paleta (Popsicle-like) desserts. Great drinks selection and I always feel like my money is well spent. Service is friendly and fast too. I could go on, but I won't because you should really just stop reading this review and go eat there now!
