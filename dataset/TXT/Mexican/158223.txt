knWBvogziOE4f82kmmi0sQ Me and my wife went to dinner last here, the new tivolli location, we love tge durango location. Ubfortunatly ladt night the service is usually excellebt 45 minutes for our food and had to chase the busser down to fet chips and more salsa. Tge decor is very nice staff nice but tge execution and delivery missed tge mark! Dissapoibtibg dont know what happenwd, a blonde tgere she was a doll, the only one there! The food just wasnt like tge other one!
