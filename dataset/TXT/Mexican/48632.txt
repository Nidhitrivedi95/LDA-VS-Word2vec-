8CcmHGUGlEEF2eNvS3ndMg I really wanted to like this place, but it was a let down. We tried the tacos, and the carnitas had a very odd flavour... almost rancid. I grew up in latin america, and I've had authentic Mexican food. I'm not sure what was up with that taco. Maybe it was just an off day, since the other reviews are glowing. It's concerning that they'd serve up the rancid pork like that though.
