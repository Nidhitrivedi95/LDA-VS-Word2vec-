zOMiDo5iGn5dTrckP4F_Ig My wife and I droped in to check it out. Street food is just what you get and plenty of it. The flavor profile is ok. Nacho's were plentiful, queso was very bland, chip were fine. When the waiter brought out the nacho's, we couldn't
believe how big it was. 
  They offer several salsa's which were ok but something was off. The other sauce they had was Russian Dressing called something else.
Since we are vegetarians, we were excited they offered grilled vegetable options, the black beans were plentiful, the vegetables were cut so small you could not identify or taste them. 
  Wife had empanada, filled with super bland 
cheese with very little flavor. Grilled veggy's
cut so small she could not see or taste them.
Price point very reasonsble, however, not our cup of tea.
