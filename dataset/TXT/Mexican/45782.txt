7pkiQvVfcsa-wtBEeNHHUg I had high hopes for Hot Head Burritos and was excited when it opened because it's in the shopping center on GV PKWY & Horizon Ridge with the Sprouts & Target I frequent; and I am always up for good Mexican food.  I was surprised to find the place empty when we came in for lunch at about 12:30 on a workday.  Never a good sign.  

A friend and I decided to share a barbacoa burrito and the taco meat (ground beef) nachos, but as we began to order an older gentleman walked in and we were told that they were going to quickly make his order before ours.  This was bizarre, but he seemed to be a friend of the franchise owner.  Still a terrible business practice.  

Once we did order, I immediately regretted the nacho choice.  They layer the chips in a Styrofoam container and add the toppings, including shredded cheese.  They top it with melted queso, but that is not enough to melt the shredded cheese or warm any of the other toppings.  You are left with a cold congealed mess that is not appetizing.  They have no way to heat the nachos, so this is not something that can be changed.  Our burrito was okay, but nothing special (heavy on the rice) and I was a little peeved that fajita veggies were a $2 up charge.
  
I may give it a second chance, but it won't be my first choice.
