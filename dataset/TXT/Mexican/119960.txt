gwd1W_0Mgzqo3QxgXrt16Q Coming from California, we were worried about finding delicious tacos, guacamole, margaritas....  RuRu's was an incredible and wonderful surprise. The food and atmosphere were equally delightful. And the banes of the dishes and drinks are so clever I had to take photos of the menu. Highly recommend!
