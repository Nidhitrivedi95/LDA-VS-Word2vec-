pk8WK6rThM5mDmcILGRh9g What a disappointment.  I have never walked away from a restaurant still hungry.  This is not authentic Mexican food and was literally flavorless.  The meat was dry, the salsa tasted like tomato sauce, and the rice was way over cooked.  All in all, I will never go there again, it's crap
