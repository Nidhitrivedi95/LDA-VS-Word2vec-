YTqtM2WFhcMZGeAGA08Cfg Stopped by while in Vegas a few weeks ago. When the Uber driver picked us up he was like how did you find this place lol. The moment we walked in we were greeted and seated. We ordered a molcajete which was delicious! The only downside was my drink, i had a vodka mango or something of that sort. It was too sour for my liking but the food was great.
