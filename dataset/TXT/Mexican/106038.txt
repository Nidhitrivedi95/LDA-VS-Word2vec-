fK1oj0dk9Bc6KsBk5mMDxg This place is awesome! The food is amazing! I love the steak burritos and their guacamole is to die for! The service is fantastic! I seem to get the same waiter, always pleasant and fast! It's very loud so not a place for a romantic dinner. I love going here with a bunch of girlfriends to catch up!
