R5WkKWo9ae2gN2feWtB_4g I want start this review off by saying that I think Serranos has great Mexican food and is one of my favorites in AZ. 

Today's review is based off the lack of customer service at the Power Road location. I should have looked at the low rating before going in.

I ordered the burro and enchilada combo meal and asked the server if it was possible to switch the enchilada to a taco. She said unfortunately there aren't any substitutions and pointed to it on the menu. I felt like a child asking the wrong question. She said though that she would check with her manager and let me know. 

Here comes the manager B, and he explained to me that there are no substitutions and unfortunately that's the way it is. I explained to him that the other locations switch it all the time. He then explained to me that they should not be doing that and that there are no substitutions. 

He said If I wanted to pay extra he would make the change otherwise there are no substitutions. Once again I felt like a kid being talked down to.

I am not sure what power trip he was on but as a  manager of a Mexican restaurant I believe customer service is key.

What the manager accomplished was for a loyal customer to get online and rate the place poorly for customer service and never visit this location again.

Hopefully the owners can teach him the importance of good customer service and sometimes being able to be flexible to work with customers requests.
