thLX_k20SPJ0KyusGTBIHw This was the most horrific Mexican food I have ever had. From the wings we ordered to the tacos and even my friends burrito it was all garbage. Even the guacamole had no flavor, how is that even possible. Their speciality margaritas tasted like they used generic sour mix, the whole food experience was awful! Cool setting though.

P.S. For a supposed chic Mexican place, they didn't even know what a blood orange margarita was. Pathetic...
