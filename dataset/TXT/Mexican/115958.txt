GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog Stopped by here yesterday and was promptly seated at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and helpful with the menu. I ordered the Siu Mai quail eggs, carnitas tacos, and shrimp MOJO. All were so imaginative and tasty dishes. I am impressed! The quail eggs were so perfectly cooked that when you put it in your mouth the eggs popped. The shrimp MOJO road the line between sweet and spicy. The carnitas were to die for and I especially liked the crispness. Good street tacos are not easy to find anymore so this was so special.

I can't wait to give it a go again.
