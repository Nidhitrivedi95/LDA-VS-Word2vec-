Also had their delicious Lux coffee which is a coffee place around the corner. The coffee is sent as while beans to this restaurant where it is then grinded up for the freshest coffee. Pure heaven. 
Moving onto the food. Hubby ordered the chilaquiles. Their chilaquiles was not only beautifully plated, it was delicious. Had a mixture of if chicken and fresh vegetables. The green salsa was prepared fresh. I had a butter and was blown away how good it was. I ordered the granola fruit bowl. It's a big parfait. Beautifully served in a big bowl. Fruits were freshly sliced and just the right amount of honey accented the bowl. 
The best was Fuego our server. He is all positive vibes and was always in to of our coffee and water. He's the best.
