nveeiYhDhj0WJu1JUmx9fw My wife and I love this place. The family that owns it are super sweet and definitely know how to cook some Mexican food. We moved up here from Tucson 4 years ago and have been trying different restaurants to remind us of our favorites from home and we finally found it. We take everyone we know to Rio Rico. Order home style chicken tacos, you won't be disappointed.
