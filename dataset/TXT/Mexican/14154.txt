First thing I noticed was that there are not enough seating, which is understandable in such a small space but I think that would be my only complaint about this place. Each taco is $3, which I thought was reasonable with the quality and how satisfied I felt after eating two tacos. I ordered the Spicy Beef taco ($3) and the special Jamaican Jerk Chicken taco ($3.50). The spicy beef taco comes in a white flour tortilla and the special taco came in a corn tortilla. I really enjoyed these tacos because of their sauce that they use, called bullseye sauce. I'm not sure what it's consisted of, but it's what makes these tacos set apart from regular tacos. We did stand the entire time while eating, but I don't think I minded because the food was so good haha. I saw their loaded nachos being made and was so tempted to order it as well but I'll save that for another time :)
