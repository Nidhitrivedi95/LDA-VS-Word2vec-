OPcGFLP_mRt9yvgP3ALXOQ My husband and I both love coming to Totopo! I definitely recommend ordering the chips and guacamole appetizer. It is made right at your table and they will ask if there are certain ingredients you would or would not like added, which is super nice. The pick 2 and pick 3 menu is where I typically order from, since you get a variety of choices. Also, the fiesta rice and casa side salad are super delicious. I never leave hungry!!
