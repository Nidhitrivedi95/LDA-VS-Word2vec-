Tacos El Gordo has to be where real Las Vegans come for authentic Tijuana tacos.

It's in the strip mall on a corner just north of Encore/Wynn.  But do *not* try to walk here, even from those hotels.  Too much on a typical Vegas weather day, and the traffic signal at that T-intersection is a joke.  NOT pedestrian friendly.

Yes, es stupido mucho.  Si, laugh at my decisione no bueno.

Staggering in, barely avoiding heat stroke... well at least the soft drink machine was working.  What timing.  One of the ice dispensers was broken.

Still, the soda was fine, and the food was relatively worth the scorching trek.

There are only two sizes for Carne Asada fries:  large and massively large.  Either one is more than enough for a couple of average appetites.

Tacos are on the small side, but they're filling and full of great flavour.  The tortillas are doused in oil, quite heavy.

Watching the guy use a macheté, slicing at the rotating hulk of Adobado pork, is kind of fun.

It's also rather sweet seeing families having a meal at Tacos El Gordo, little boys play-fighting their brothers.

Speaking Spanish (which I don't ;/ waah ) is an advantage.  They seem to hook you up with extra good stuff, if you can hold a convo with them.

Not much else to say, except...
Tacos El Gordo = excellente!
