70WDApYtMcLlrnb1EUW6fg Someone told me that this place was rated the best Mexican Resturant in Arizona. I was not disappointed. The drinks and service were top notch. The atmosphere was a real plus, be sure to ask for outside seating which provides you a table with your own fire pit. Simply over the top. The food presentation was nicely done and the homemade guacamole prepared at table side was worth the trip. We were staying at the Fairmont with friends and went here twice. Great experience a must try place to have a relaxing dinner with friends!
