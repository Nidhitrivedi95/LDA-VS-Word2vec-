4DLsC4BTUoEqFGusetQVlQ I was very excited to go there based on all the pictures I saw on Instagram.  The minute my friends and I walked in (4 ppl), we were greeted by a hostness who was not very polite. Asking customers in front of you to wait while picking up the phone repeatedly during the 2 minute conversation.  In addition, the hostness was  talking to her friend about a personal problem, instead of taking our reservation. 

However, I was expecting better service when we were seated. We placed our order relatively quickly. Our appetizers were great (mango salad,meatballs, corn). To our disappointment the sangria pitcher which cost $55 was filled with 3/4 ice and probably the worse sangaria I have had. After waiting for nearly 30 mins, the server told us the kitchen is busy. We waited for 1 1/2 hour before cancelling our order and walking out. Our bill was $96 (24 pp) and we were starving.
