vQq_sX0kSAUdT3yLW06q5A Talk about a best kept secret! This place is "tucked away" in the office max plaza on the corner of Hayden and Osborn. Sundays from 3 to 6 PM they have live music!! Indoor and outdoor seating is available. Both the waitstaff and bartenders are incredibly friendly. The owner even stopped by the table to check in on us. Are usually have the Al Pastor tacos, but tonight I tried the pig wings. Just enough kick in the sauce to give your taste buds a treat. The pig wings are slow cooked the day before then glazed and placed on the grill prior to serving. Listed as an appetizer these two wings are healthy portion for a small dinner. Served with Rob vegetables such as carrots, cucumbers, radishes, and red onion. The jalapeño dipping sauce is the icing on the cake! I started with chips salsa and guacamole and had to stop myself before I filled up and didn't have room for my main course. The music wasn't too loud the crowd wasn't rowdy and the prices were reasonable. If you haven't tried this place you're missing out! If you haven't tried recently I highly recommend you come in again.
