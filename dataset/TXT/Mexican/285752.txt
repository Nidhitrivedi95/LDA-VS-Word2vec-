Y91-sIlVyH6v4YM6sTINAw I love their under 500 calorie offerings. I have had the burrito and the bowl (the one with broccoli) on several occasions. I will try the quesadilla 

I came last week for the black bean/broccoli bowl and they failed to mention that they were out of broccoli and threw corn in instead...I was not happy!

I came back tonight and they tried to pull the exact same thing, so I ordered something else. The girl says they have been out of broccoli for "quite a while." Really? Did the manager think of going to the store to get some while they wait for their usual shipment!
