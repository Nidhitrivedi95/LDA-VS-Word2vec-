T-KniGykrZ46ZC9plOTspw The staff is nice but that's about it. For the price you pay the food does not stack up. Very bland in flavor. People told me this place blew Chipotle out of the water and I think that's a far cry. Food also takes way too long to get finished even when it isn't busy. I don't see why I would ever choose this place when I can hit up any of the several Chipotle locations and get better tasting for made quicker at an overall better price point
