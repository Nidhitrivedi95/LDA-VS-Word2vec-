_ucDskZqK5w1QHkoA_nlRw Tried this place for the first time, and loved everything about it! This place is pretty small so you may want or have to get your tacos to go, but it's absolutely worth it! I ordered the chicken and carnitas tacos and paid only $6. The menu is super simple which I like, because it makes the decision process much easier. Plus, I'd rather eat at a place that offers few, but high quality items as opposed to a plethora of mediocre items. The fresh ingredients are right there behind the counter as you can watch your meal being prepared. Personally, I found the chicken to have to more flavor so next time I'll go with that. I saw someone else's order of loaded nachos and for about five bucks, they looked hearty and tasty. I'll definitely bring friends back to this place for more good eats. Also, they have vegan and vegetarian options available.!
