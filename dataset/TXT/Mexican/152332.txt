JXiOlujB1i7aZvkNJ9xpzQ The first time I ate here I really liked it and was so excited to come back. Well, I finally made it back and for the life of me I can't figure out why I was so excited. I was not impressed at all by anything on my last visit. Not even the salsa. The food was very bland to me. 

Mexican food is my favorite to eat and I will not waste another trip here. No offense to this restaurant or the staff. The place is clean and the staff is friendly. I have just had way better Mexican food at other establishments. Also, compared to most other Mexican restaurants this place is a little more pricey. Maybe due to location... 

Cozumel in independence for the win!
