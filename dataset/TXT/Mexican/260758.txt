VRwT0pscR5vESCrAnUpNwQ First time visiting Wilbur and I have this to say! Great experience, friendly staff, they dont kick you out just becuase you are done eating. Nice and clean atmosphere and washroom, food was excellent and fast! I love the condiment options they provide. I got a chance to try all the delicious sauces that compliment the tacos and burritos. Price is standard. Definitely will be returning (even though I'm from North York area) but well worth the commute. Looking forward to going back and making this my go to place for a quick bite.
