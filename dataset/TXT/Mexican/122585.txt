HGLMe4y0y_VsBkDLdpfBLA Im staying at the hotel here where papi chulos is at. I just looked here on yelp and noticed the hours of operation. Now I am very irritated. I was absolutely starving, had not eaten all day, I got settled into my room and rushed over to the restaurant to get some dinner before they closed, I walked into the place at 930. After standing at the host stand for 10 minutes without even being acknowledged by any of the employees,  I walked up to the bar and asked one of the staff members if they weren't seating anymore tables for the night ( there were 2 tables outside w guests and 1 inside and a nearly full bar ). Mind you ,it's now almost 945 and I've been there nearly 15 minutes. I was told 'oh no, the kitchen actually closed quite a while ago'. Okay thank you, and I left. I then had to walk a little over a mile to get something to eat. I was just thinking about how wierd it is, I don't know of any restaurants in the entire city that close before 10 any night of the week. Well here I look at the business hours and they are in fact open until 10 on Thursday.  What happend?  How crappy is that? The hotel's restaurant won't serve a guest 20 minutes before closing time. I will never be eating or staying at this establishment ever again
