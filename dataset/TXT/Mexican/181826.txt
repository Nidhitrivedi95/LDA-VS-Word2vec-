nFR7dDedxRuBeZz_6Cdalg Based on the reviews, we were expecting some decent chow, but this place was a huge disappointment. Nice décor. Service was good and friendly...it's not the servers' fault that the margs were just OK and the only food worth eating is the chips and salsa. Steak tacos were OK, but we certainly wouldn't go back for them. We also ordered one of their signature dishes -- flank steak wrapped around a stuffed poblano chili -- and it was bland and tough, and the accompanying veggies were mushy. Worst item we had was the queso fundido -- I'm pretty sure it's watered-down Velveeta with yesterday's taco meat thrown in. And it's pricey. We definitely won't be back.
