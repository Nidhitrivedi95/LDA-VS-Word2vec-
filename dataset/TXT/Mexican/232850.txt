sPPh1LJllyr5jUpKFTxxag I visited Asada for the first time a couple of weeks ago. The employees were very friendly and passionate about the food they were preparing, leaving me with no doubt that my burrito was being prepared with care (unlike your run of the mill, assembly line sandwich shop).

I can't remember exactly what I got on my veggie burrito other than the fact that I don't recall saying "no" to any of my options. It tasted great, and was quite filling. I'll definitely be back!
