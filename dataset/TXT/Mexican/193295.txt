OOHlm2lbVgPHhSe98YW3yA Mi Gusta is located in The District, next to the water play feature.  Been meaning to try this place forever because of the ALL NATURAL MEATS, SUSTAINABLE FISH & REAL FRUIT AGUA FRESCA.


As soon as you walk in, granted there is no line, you get greeted by the friendly staff.  You walk up and order and take a number to your seat.  Seating is limited inside, since it's a smaller place.  But granted the weather is nice, they do have outdoor seating.   

This place gets busy, especially on the weekends, since families enjoy the water feature as well as the good eats.  

Let's get to the good stuff:  THE FOOD.

TACOS:

CARNITAS
Marinated Slow Cooked Pork, Pico de Gallo, Avocado



PORK BELLY BANH MI
Grilled Pork Belly, Vietnamese Slaw, Cilantro
The luscious pork belly and the sweet and salty pickled slaw went perfectly together.  One of my faves! 

BARBACOA
Slow Cooked Shredded Beef, Diced Onion, Cilantro
Pretty good.  Wanted more of a kick.  So with the addition of their yummy sauces it was on point.

KOREAN KALBI
Marinated Korean Steak, Asian Cabbage Slaw
Another one of my favorites.  Who doesn't love a bit of ko-mex fusion!!

CHARBROILED CARNE ASADA
Traditional Marinated Steak, Pico de Gallo, Queso Fresco
This one was a but disappointing.  Not as bold as the other tacos.  

FISH
Sustainable Fish, Cabbage, Cilantro, Wasabi Crema
Tender fish with he crispy cabbage, very good fish taco.  

*SHRIMP CEVICHE with chips
Disappointing.  A bit bland and it had more veg filler than any shrimp.  Very little shrimp.  


The agua frescas were refreshing and different.  So yummy!!!!   We had the pineapple basil and watermelon. So so so good.  Definitely must try.
