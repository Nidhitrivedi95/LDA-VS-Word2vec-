I779CNMLWhZu6BxkGfLvwQ Awesome!!! We tried Smokin Fins for the first time tonight. Staff was super friendly and helped negotiate some pretty tough dietary restrictions. We ordered the cedar plank salmon with veggies which were both perfectly cooked, the fish and chips (also reported to be great), the mixed poke bowl (yum) and the smoked salmon and arugula salad (I substituted the wasabi soy dressing at the waitress' recommendation which I would definitely do again). Food was excellent, service was attentive and there are so many other menu items I want to try so we will definitely be back soon.
