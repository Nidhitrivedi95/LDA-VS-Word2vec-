pomGBqfbxcqPv14c3XH-ZQ This used to be our favorite Mexican restaurant.  While we used to love it everything started going downhill ... the service, the quality of food and especially the cleanliness.   When you can see cockroaches in the restaurant one can only expect them in the kitchen as well.   
We did try a few times but nothing ever got better.  It only seemed to get worse.   We no longer choose Leticias
