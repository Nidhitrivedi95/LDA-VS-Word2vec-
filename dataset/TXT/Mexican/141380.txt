Both dishes were delicious, food was hot, and more than enough portion. Our server was attentive, polite, and on top of things. Good multi tasker. Kept out drinks full. I can't remember his name though. :( The other server near him was just as sweet. She wasn't our server but due to a mix up we ended up sitting in her section. She checked on us a couple times too to make sure things were going well. Great wait staff. 
The bad: upon entering one of the two hosts asked how many. I said two, and neither of them did anything. So the manager that was standing there repeated that it was a table for two and told them to get us a table. She then grabbed a couple of menus and told us to follow her. She put us at an uncomfortable table right in between two large parties. When the manager came by I asked if our servers section included the booth in the corner that was small enough for two people so we wouldn't be getting in the way. He said yeah. I then asked if we could move to the booth. He said, "why?" The most rude why I've ever heard. Does it really matter why? Whatever, we told him why (because of how crowded it was) and he pointed to another booth and said, "why don't you go sit there then." Rudest guy ever. And that's the manager!? He later came to apologize but not really because he said sorry, he didn't think he was rude. 

Anyways, you'll have a fabulous experience if you get in and seated without seeing this guy.
