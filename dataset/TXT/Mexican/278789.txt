XOqoNwn1igQRhb3mCGo7BA Horrible customer service! It was my first time trying this place and I was really looking forward to it. We were a party of 4 adults and 2 children, we placed our orders and waited....and waited. It took them almost an hour to bring is our food! I'm lucky they don't make their own beer or I would of waited an hour for that too. We went on a Saturday and it wasn't empty but certainly not busy enough to have our food take so long. The music was questionable, they had a what looked like to be a family singing karaoke & DJ'ing, I was only ok with the little girl doing her best Selena impersonation. We asked to speak with the supervisor who took so long that we had to double check with our waitress to make sure she had let her supervisor know we wanted to see her. When the supervisor finally showed up she didn't even tell us her name or apologize! It seems their staff doesn't get proper training. We were given a discount and gift card which almost made our whole meal there free but the damage was done. The service sucks so bad we wont be coming back. Really disappointing because they have a good Yelp rating, either their staff and families are on here 5 starring the place or other customers are lucky because if you read their reviews a lot of people have had issues with their staff and horrible service, gracias for nada.
