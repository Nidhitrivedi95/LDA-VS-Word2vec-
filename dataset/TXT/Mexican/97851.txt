ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA I came here with some friends based off word of mouth, not looking at the menu prior. Let's just say wow! I wasn't particularly impressed with the menu looking at it, but ordered the Ocotillo Chicken. I would say it was maybe one of the best chickens I have had prepared. Comparable to the Elements at Sanctuary. Everyone else loved their food. The big plates might be a bit spency- but easily shareable between two with an appetizer.

Next time I am getting the ribs! They looked amazing.
