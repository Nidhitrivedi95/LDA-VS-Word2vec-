mUAEn4Ud0PN-Dv446vhfSg Sorry, but they just heated my food up in a microwave right in front of me. It was good food -- chile relleno with rice and beans. But they nooked it to like lava hot, like only a microwave can do.

I stopped in after a meeting at the coffee shop next door. It was like 6pm, and the place was empty. Should've been a warning sign to see it that empty.
