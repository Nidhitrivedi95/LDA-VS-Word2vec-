RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg My God!!! I think this place is heaven! Their tacos are bomb.com We ordered the following:

- Tacos de Asada 
- Tacos de Adobada 
- Tacos de al Pastor 
- Tacos de Suadero (brisket)
- Vampiros (double stack tostadas, grilled cheese w/alpastor)

Everything was well seasoned, and the grilled chiles and cebollitas were cooked perfect. The only thing that lacked was the salsa, it was not spicy enough. But then again I love my salsa super HOT! But that's ok... It was still pretty damn good! I know when we come back to Vegas during Thanksgiving week we will be hitting this place a few times during our stay. 

I really loved their Vampiros! The tostada was nice and toasty and the meat and fried cheese on it was on point too. 

Highly recommend this place if u don't live in the San Diego area... These tacos are true to the Tijuana style tacos, BEST!!! And going to their website it says they started in Tijuana before heading to San Diego and Las Vegas. So there u go! Authentic! Tijuana has the best tacos hands down! And they live up to their roots! 

See you soon Gordo!!! We got nothing but love for you baby! muah!
