X57f6FWZiwI1wOidPPhOrQ Ohh Dos, how I miss thee.

I have yet to find a comparable place in Chicago. Good, inexpensive food (WTF is IN that delicious cheesy goo? It's amazing!), and strong, inexpensive, not-to-sugary, tart, delicious margaritas by the pitcher.

It's not exactly fancy cuisine, but I think we're all ok with that.

Dos, we will continue to visit you each and every time we are in Champaign.
