1HfkEkNhI6XJXkgrCTBKpw This place has a good atmosphere BUT the food I ordered..eh. We went for lunch and I ordered the pirogies because you can't go wrong with pirogies, right??? WRONG. No amount of sour cream could salvage these things. Along with the mystery meat that the meatballs that came with it were made of, I've never tasted anything like it, and I mean that in the worst way possible. The texture of the meatball was that of a sponge. Gagging just reliving the experience. On another note I ordered the yogurt parfait also and that was great! So the whole entire meal wasn't bad. Probably won't be back for brunch again, and if I do I for sure won't be ordering that meal.
