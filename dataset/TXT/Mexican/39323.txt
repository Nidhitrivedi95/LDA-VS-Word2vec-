I am still in complete wonder as to why people complain about what an establishment does not have on their menu. Well why can't every joint have sparkling, mineral, mountain-top water in them? Because you can't light one up if it is wet and I don't smoke. Here is what El Pollo Supremo has and it's pretty good:

I've ordered the combo plate the most often and it comes with a very generous amount of a 1/4lb portion of sliced steak that has been char-grilled. The beef has always been very tender, juicy, never overly seasoned. This almost gives this place a 5/5 alone. The 1/4 chicken is usually a leg and a thigh and is char-grilled as well. Maybe I'm just unlucky but the chicken has been consistently on the dry side. A side of really wet beans that don't seem to be cooked along with anything. A side of pickled onions adds good flavor to the beef and chicken. And a little puddle of pureed, somewhat-flavorless tomatoes that's really runny. It comes with 3 tasty tortillas that seem to be homemade; they're all a bit uneven and sometimes parts are burned.

There's no chips n guac (nor peas), no queso of any sort, rice (which is fluffy, light) is extra, and they take cash only. The booth seating is a little on the tight side and the whole place probably couldn't hold more than 24 people but the tables are always clean. The ladies at the front counter are always very friendly. They can get really busy around lunchtime during the week.

The 1/2 beef has been the best value and it really knocks the socks off many restaurants' steak fajitas.
