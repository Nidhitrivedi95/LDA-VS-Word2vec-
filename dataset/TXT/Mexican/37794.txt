5VMqROXPjHCKdlPnm0xyvQ I like the salsa bar and thought the salad with grilled chicken (all white meat!) was yummy. Everything tasted fresh. They give you lots of chips, which is great. The guacamole is not the best, but it wasn't bad. 

You can also place your order online and customize as much as you want then have it ready to pick up, so that saves time and is convenient. I definitely recommend for a quick lunch or dinner - more variety in menu options than Chipotle.
