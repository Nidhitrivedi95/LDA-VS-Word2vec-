qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A This place is fantastic! I came in with my boyfriend and we were completely surprised how visually appealing this place was. Everything was so brightly lit & we were seated with a variety of bread accompanied with some delicious spread. Before ordering, we voiced out our concerns of peanut allergies. Our waiter, Ernesto, kindly read over the menu & informed us which dishes included them. I ordered the jerk chicken linguini & my Bf ordered the Jamaican curry bow w/ couscous. When our orders came out, a different server placed our food on our table & also kindly reassured us that they made sure there were no peanuts in any of our dishes. Aside from the amazing service, the food was phenomenal! If you're really looking for a flavorful, spicy kick, I highly recommend the linguini. We ended the night with a delectable red velvet cake topped with white chocolate. Definitely coming back again!
