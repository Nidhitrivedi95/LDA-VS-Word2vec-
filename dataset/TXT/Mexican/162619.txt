lA4bWd0prl1huLmiHTQHpw I'm usually a little leery about trying Mexican seafood places but am so glad I tried this one! Everything I've tried there has been very good but by far my favorite has to be the "cucaraches" appetizer, terrible name I know but super delicious! The shrimp in hot sauce and shrimp fajitas are also very tasty. Right when you sit down they bring out complimentary fresh salsa and shrimp ceviche so you can't beat that! The only downside is it can be very loud when they have the mariachis are playing so any attempts at conversating with your date (and the waitstaff) aren't going to happen.
