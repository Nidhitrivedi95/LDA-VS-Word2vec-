F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw Sunday Night Dinner!! 

This was my second time ordering off the Sunday Night Dinner menu but my first time dining on the patio. 

The Sunday Night Dinner Menu is meant to be shared between two for $30 total. The menu gives the option of salsa/guac, enchiladas, and flan. It is a great "deal" and takes the work out of ordering. Last night we sat on the patio, awesome, and went with the spinach enchilada option. I have had the chicken enchiladas before, and although yummy, the spinach kicked butt. The blood orange margaritas were to die for. As usual, the service was perfect.
