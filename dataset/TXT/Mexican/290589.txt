YQFcxE9UXrKc-QuTUu7twQ 1st let me say there's 5 handful of restaurants on this strip. However, I stopped in Loco Patron because it was happy hour. Sat at the bar. The bartender shot the breeze with everyone but me. He looked like he didn't even want to be there. $5 Margaritas and $5 Nachos which was great. For the cost, guess you shouldn't expect good customer service. I'll go to Diego Pops next time where everyone looks happy and cheerful.
