QhJT2fro3Dp1AaIVY7pgzQ The food is like homemade.it is family owned and there is not much on the menu so the quality of the food is so much better. It's a hole in the place but if you are looking for Mexican food this is the place. I have tried their taquitos, burritos, tacos, menudo, tortas, and breakfast menu items everything has been great.
