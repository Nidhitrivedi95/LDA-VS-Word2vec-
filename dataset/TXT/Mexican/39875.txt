6LVadHqqjWlVnd-T7gAZyA The Garcia's on Thomas Rd. is 10x better than this location.  This location has much higher traffic than any other Garcia's we've been to.  We had a 45 minute wait on a Saturday.  

The table was dirty when we were seated (food from previous patrons; appetizer plate wasn't cleaned well in dishwasher). The waitress remedied the situation quickly. 


FOOD: 
I had a skinny margarita that was pretty bad.  Made from a way-too-sugary mix.  

We got the nachos for an appetizer and split the spinach enchiladas for our entree. Sizable portions for both. I only took one bite of the entree we split since the nachos were enough for a meal, even when splitting.   The flavors left much to be desired. Nachos can only be so bad, but it's clearly pre-made guacamole and generic pre-grated cheese. I didn't taste the beans and rice that came with the enchilada, but my boyfriend said they tasted like standard chain restaurant beans and rice. The enchilada had minimal flavor. 

This Garcia's didn't live up to our previous experiences.  I know, I know, it's a chain, but I've had some good food previously! My suggestion: do a little Yelping and find an authentic Mexican restaurant nearby.
