I know people are complaining about the spice level, but my aunt asked for a hotter version and they brought it to our table.  I love my salsas mild, so I must have pounded half the basket of extra crispy and fresh tortilla chips.  Because the salsa is served in a small carafe, you must be drinking the thing before needing to ask for refills.

Their portions are massive and I tried my best, but it was a gut buster.  I love that fact that they have low carb tortillas,and they too were massive like the size of a baby's t-shirt.  I could have easily made 2 full burritos with the load of vegetables, meat and beans that came with the meal.  The leftovers were killer and just hit the spot since it had another day to marinate.  

I am grateful that I ordered what I did, but I wouldn't recommend the fish tacos, because my husband didn't seem to want to give them 4 stars.  Since I'm not heading back to AZ for a bit, I'm sticking to my guns with a solid 4 stars for the steak and chicken mix fajitas with the low carb tortillas.  Darn it, now I'm hungry after writing this review.  

The prices are more than reasonable, but if you want to have a cheaper meal, they have an pretty decent happy hour menu too.
