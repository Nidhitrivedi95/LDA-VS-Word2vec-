nl2nsBi9U3sW1R34nF0s0Q This place is pretty good, I got the chicharon torta. The torta had good flavor & a nice kick but they really skimped on the chicharon. I had more bread than anything else. I probably will return to try their taquitos though, cause those suckers looked delish! I keep you guys posted!
