CsS9WsonGYyE3vINi5bxSg Hands down my favourite place to eat in Toronto. I would have never imagined I would call tacos my favourite food, but now couldn't imagine anything ever surpassing them. Be it their braised beef, chicken kampungi, or Baja fish taco, (among many other delicious options) I am completely blown away. They also offer fresh menu items smoked daily in house which make choosing a single dinner option even more difficult. This top notch cuisine, paired with excellent cerveza, or hand crafted cocktails, all served by warm, welcoming, and knowledgeable staff, makes them a stand out in the city, and a must try experience.
