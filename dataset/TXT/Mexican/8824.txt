_u1Bq7QsgMUXSMex8QHqLQ Sorry but my standards have been set high after living in San Diego for awhile. 

Its probably a 4 star for Toronto mexican food. Somewhat like Chipotle but I don't understand the wait. Took about 10 minutes to get a burrito, guess they were heating something up. Chipotle is a lot faster but overall the burrito was pretty good.

Nothing compared to SD joints though but if you are having a craving for mexican food in Toronto, stop by. 

P.S. Grab a poutine upstairs and fulfill two cravings at once!
