pEH8XwiyGOe1t7GlboAgGw I visited Los Colibris yesterday evening for dinner with a small group. It was a magical experience and I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a fancy dinner and amazing food.
 This space is very modern and elegant but at the same time has a very relaxed and comfortable vibe. The set up is very inviting, there is a place in the front for an intimate dinner or drinks and further back is an array of booths and tables to fit larger groups.

Our server was extremely friendly, knowledgable and efficient. I did not catch his name but he really made ever effort to make us feel comfortable. He suggested a few dishes and we ordered
Ceviche Blancho $13,Queso Fundido $15, Raja Poblanas $16 and Empanadas for appetizers  and Huachinango a la Veracruzana $24,Cero en Mancha Mantel $24, Chipotle Arrachera con frijoles $26  and a lamb dish.
 Every single dish that came out of that kitchen was beautifully prepared and tasted wonderful. I was really impressed with how perfectly the meat was cooked and how all of the flavours complimented each other. The meat was tender, infused with flavour and of high quality. I can honestly say this was probably the best meal I have ever had.
The one dish that I could eat for the rest of my life was the Queso Fundido. It was hot, cheesy with chorizo sausage. It was simple yet addictive. Our table devoured this dish within 5 minutes!! I had to stop myself from ordering another one. I cannot express how amazing this was, it is something you need to experience for yourself. 
 
Overall our meal was excellent and we will definitely be going back!!
