XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg I love watching Bobby's shows, unfortunately no 
Cali restaurant locations. So I jumped at the chance to try lunch here when visiting Vegas with my teen sons. Of course I went sans my sons. Gave them McDs money and strolled in right before the lunch crowd hit.
I dropped a star because the hostess immediately asked if I wanted to be seated at the bar. 
I declined but she only offered me a table closely arranged to other tables with couples and groups. I asked for a table somewhere else where I wouldn't feel like I was a third wheel but the hostess claimed nothing else was available. 
So I settled for the bar, the bartenders were very nice and offered suggestions of the white peach margarita. It was very nice and strong-should be for $13. I had the BBQ lamb Cobb salad which was flavorful and filling except for the lamb all ingredients were routine. Finally the banana cream pie was delicious, light creamy with fresh bananas, custard,whip cream topped with a delectable toffee crisp cookie. 
I hope Mr Flay opens a restaurant in northern California somewhere, Napa maybe?
