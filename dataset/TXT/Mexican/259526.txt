Voeq7aGDmCGMjE_SQiHwRA Went on a Friday night. Luckily we had reservations for a larger party. We were crammed in a booth. I think a table would have been more practical but I guess this was the best they could have done. Oh well. Just glad we got to sit. My friends ordered a pitcher of Spicy margaritas. It looked good, had hot peppers in them with a wooden spoon to mix. I tried a virgin margarita, prego friendly which was nice! I didn't want to feel left out.

I think my favorite taco is the short rib. The waiter claimed that the fish tacos are the best but I beg to differ. It was alright wish it had a little more flavor. Now that I think of it, try the sauces. They had a smokey salsa and a tomatillo sauce. Darn my prego brain! Overall the tacos are pretty tasty, simple, but small. Prices are decent. I think they make their own tortillas from what the waiter said. The appetizers were really good. I tried the corn dip, queso, and the guacamole. Yummy! They also ran out of tequila. Haha what kind of bar runs out of tequila? But what do I care. I'm pregnant. <U+200D> I would definitely come back.
