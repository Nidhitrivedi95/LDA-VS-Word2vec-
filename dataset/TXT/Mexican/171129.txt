M8S7poDhCIzqQx1--GB-ww My wife and I had dinner on the patio the other night.  We started with the habanero fried squid, which was a little soggy, but it did have a nice flavour.  For mains, I had the pressed cubano sandwich, and my wife had the fish sandwich.  Both were okay, but lacked in flavour.  This was disappointing after having the squid.

Service was good.
