3te8dGIvzz5V5_kMIr6-Dg I friggin love these burritos. Today, I got the TVP plus vegan cheese plus guacamole and it was terribly delicious. I also appreciate how chill the space is whenever I've been there (often in contrast to the busyness of the rest of the market).

The price after the additions ($10.50, tax included) might sound steep for a burrito, but I'd argue that there's a lot of good stuff in there and, compared to other "fast" food, I think this is a much better option.
