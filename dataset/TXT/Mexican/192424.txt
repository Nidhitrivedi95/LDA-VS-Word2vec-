Ok9vikKusbG_Ue9pJf6s3Q I live close by in the Old Port. I've passed by many times. This time, I decided, on an whim, to check it out. I'm a huge fan of Mexican cuisine and was curious about a small business (respect) that would have the smarts and gumption to open up in Chinatown. I ordered the Yucatan pulled pork with pickled radish tacos. My young son had the dessert. 
The tacos were...fine. The temperature (a higher one) would have helped the taste of the meat. I wouldn't go with any of the desserts (which are unspecified and placed under the heading of "upon request.") Granted, I don't like desserts, but Mexican desserts are varied, fantastic, and worth offering properly.
All this said: La Capital is certainly not a poor choice...but I do feel that I'm saying that by default. Montreal has few places (at least to my knowledge) that offer decent Mexican fare at least at a decent price point. The prices at La Capital are great, but I felt the freshness and overall quality of the ingredients would benefit from, maybe a 20% (?) increase in effort, care, and respect for Latin fare. The servers were lovely, as far as I could tell.
