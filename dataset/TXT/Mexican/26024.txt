3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ Whenever architecture is discussed churches are bound to make their way into the conversation, and for good reason. Churches are beautifully constructed, so it makes sense that the creator of Taco Guild would keep the building close to original when renovating. However, I wish the owner put as much thought into the food. The tacos were disappointing, not very flavorful, and overpriced. Phoenix is a city rich with Mexican culture, and with a bevy of delicious, reasonably priced Mexican places to choose from, Taco Guild is a let down. 

Cheers.
