jIzygnVmajEXYmfsBNY_Gw I'm a fan of TexMex, but neutral to authentic Mexican food meaning I don't hate it, but when I crave it I want, so I decided to go here because it was close. Now I give this place 3 stars, because it's not one of those places that knocks your socks off, but if your looking for quick quality Mexican food, and sick of chipotle this place is a cool spur of the moment find. ( I ordered a chicken taco salad, so it is kind of hard to mess that up, but the vinaigrette chicken I got was quality white meat, not the fatty cheap meat served at a typical TexMex restaurant)
