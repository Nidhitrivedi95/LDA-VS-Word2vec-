I remembering loving the other location, but rarely go because of distance. When the one of 215 and Cheyenne opened, I was really excited. I wanted to wait for the hype to settle down  and decided to stop by for dinner last night.

I ordered two adobada (sp) tacos with everything and a half order of carne asada fries. The adobada was crunchy.. maybe overcooked. It was so crispy that it took away from the taste of the taco. The carne asada  ratios are way off. The standard order comes with a ton of fries and sour cream with a sprinkling of meat, cheese and avocado. The carne has such great flavor, but every other bite was gristle, so half of the dish was inedible. The excessive amount of sour cream made the dish cold.

I spent over $12, which is a bit pricey for what I got. The half order of fries was $7.. that's the price of a full order at Roberto's.

I probably won't be back, at least not to this location.
