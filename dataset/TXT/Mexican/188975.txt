OA5Li3ySzhrbG_WvD_QGYA this place has bangin' tacos. there's a whole bunch of options, including brunch tacos with fried eggs, and even a DIY menu where you construct your own own. you speak my language, Barrio.

chimichurri-marinated steak taco + fried egg +avocado = awesome hangover cure. the El Jefe (chorizo AND chicken within a hard shell with a soft shell around it) was also excellent.

the menus are pieces of paper that you fill out with a pencil. simple and effective. prices aren't bad, averaging 4 or 5 bucks each for a sizable taco. since you can add on to the menu defaults or make your own, it's really up to you.

the bacon bloody Mary was delicious. a nice slab of thick-cut bacon made extra-crispy is the centerpiece of this drink. and it moderate kick to it in terms of both spice and potency.

outdoor dining on a warm day, with tacos and booze in hand, with your family. you just can't beat that.
