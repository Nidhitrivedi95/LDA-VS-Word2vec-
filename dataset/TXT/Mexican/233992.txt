SUd3IyEN7n5OYEGyt_U5lg Today out of luck I googled closest burrito place while I was working and Jefes Taco Shop was literally a minute away. I'm always weary about trying new burrito places but I was hungry. I end up at a gasoline station with a little taco shop inside, okay. Looked at the menu and order the California burrito. As a pay Ben the owner I assume greets me. He spark up conversation and I find out homie is from SD. Here is where it gets good he tells me he is using the most amazing Santa Fe flour tortillas straight from Otay farms I small market I south SD! This place is light! The burrito was out of this world. Can't believe I found this place! Thanks Ben for making feel like I was back home I will forever be a costumer. Btw gotta let me know when that next delivery of tortillas comes in.
