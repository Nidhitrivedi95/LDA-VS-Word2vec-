c_XbaJqhm-5ycSBOkVUBmg Don Taco is located on Ste. Catherine Street West in the Shaughnessy Village area of downtown Montreal. I accidentally came across this place one day and was surprised with their taco offerings. It is difficult to get tacos in Montreal so this was a good find. It would appear that it is paired in the same location with a bakery (not reviewed here). 

The first time I came here I had two tacos from the menu, the Alambre and the Asado, an order of hot pimento peppers and a coke for a little under $9.00. The Asado taco was tender grilled beef served with onion and coriander. The Alhambra was a sauteed chicken taco served with red and green peppers,onions and melted cheese. Both were served on a soft shell corn tortilla. Both were excellent but a little on the small side. I also had a side order of hot Mexican jalapeno peppers. They were precisely that, I could only eat two or three, they were so hot. 

On a Tuesday I returned for the .99 cent Dorado taco special. These were ground beef tacos served with lettuce and cream. They were small yet tasty tacos. I also ordered a side order of refried beans.  This made for an interesting cheapie night paired with a movie at the old Montreal Forum (Pepsi Forum) a few blocks west at Atwater. The decor was very clean and the toilet was extremely spacious, modern and ultra clean. It would appear that the women working here are hard working and dedicated, more power and success to them!
