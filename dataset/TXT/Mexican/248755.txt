uBGPTzye3wrxZPf54AXuFg Registered on Yelp just to leave this review. The service was very slow despite about twenty of waiting staff running around. Waiting about an hour for my shrimp tacos if you can call it tacos. The shrimp was in one bowl and tortillas in another and I had to assemble them myself. The food was just tasteless. Plantain fritters were just burned. Basically waisted $30
