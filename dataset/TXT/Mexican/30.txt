-_O0VCqTfHWwweJsj7khNg Slowest Chipotle I've ever been to. Easily takes twice as long as other places that have twice the line. One can imagine an All Chipotle Olympics, with events like Fastest Burrito Roll and Most Chicken Cooked In An Hour.  This team would come in very near the last.

The management here should take their team to some other Chipotle, any other Chipotle and see how it should be done.
