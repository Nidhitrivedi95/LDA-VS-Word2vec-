e3B8xTCLvPR1jZWkoCjuUA Thank you, Chipotle.

Thank you for proving how shitty employees can be.
We walked in, ordered two steak burritos, and watched their clueless glares only to see that they were out of steak, so whatever, we got a different meat. Bad start. To add onto this, however, they put toppings on the burrito without me asking for them, charged us extra, and could not even wrap the burritos correctly. The bag was sopping wet when we came back. My 90 year old arthritis and dimentia affected grandmother could work better than these able-bodied idiots. They even put guacamole on Jimmy's burrito, and now poor Jimmy cannot hear because he is allergic to avocado.
Needless to say, a great experience. Wonderful staff. Fabulous location.

As if.
