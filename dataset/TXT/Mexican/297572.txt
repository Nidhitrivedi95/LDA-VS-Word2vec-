zdE82PiD6wquvjYLyhOJNA I like KoMex, my husband loves it. This last time I got the wonton soup - so flavorful and an egg was stirred in it - and the chicken wings that I ended up taking home. Husband had the enchiladas and the iced tee; he couldn't stop talking about how good everything was. He especially enjoyed the tea - which was funny, because if he had been offered Mango-passion fruit tea instead of just iced tea he would have said "no way" cuz it sounds to fruity, but he loved it! LOL
