DaVTuhzi6EgWStb2eAjNjA This place has great reviews and I really really wanted to like them. 
The location is kind of odd and parking is slim. There was a lady smoking right by the door (I get horrible headaches from smoke) so that was not a very good start. I think places of business should pay attention to that kind of details, since it is clearly a violation of city codes.

Came here with a group of 4 and they all wanted to turn back when we got to the door. 

The place was very small, and it felt kind of crowded. Once we got the menu, we were a little surprised by the limited options and the prices... which seemed not fitting for the kind of location. Again, the rest of my party wanted to leave. I asked them to stay and order an appetizer, and then decide. We went for queso fundido ($10.95).

I am so glad we did this instead of ordering our food. 
What we got was a ridiculous tiny portion of queso fundido. Questionable even for a one person portion. It was super tiny... 
That said, we all sampled the cheese, asked for the check, and left.

Our server was very friendly and professional, and that part was great. But it would have been very expensive for a group of 4 to eat here if the rest of the items were to be like the queso fundido experience. I am OK with paying higher prices for good food, but I want the rest of the experience to match the price. This is a tiny place with tiny portions and sort of upscale prices.
