South Mountain has breathtaking views of the valley and the photo opportunities at sunset are amazing. It gives you a whole new aspect on the Downtown Phoenix Skyline.

Now about the restaurant. This place is quaint and authentic and offers a taste into great Mexican cuisine! The margaritas are large and tasty! Don't miss the Sangria Margarita (Twyla loved it!) The patio is cozy and friends are made easily during dinner conversation here.

The food as a whole is awesome and it is our favorite of three locations to visit. I had the Green Chili Carne Burrito and a Machaca Taco. Both were wonderful. Our server was both funny and accommodating. If you have never ventured to the South side of town, don't be scared, they like to eat just like you and I. So, just because your on the South side of town, does not mean that something bad will happen. Different cultures. That's all. If you don't take a cruise down here you are really missing out. Live a little I say! Viva la Mexico!
