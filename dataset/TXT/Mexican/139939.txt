J5ebC7fKqrSF8KuS8d6hgw I'm just back from my 1st trip to SBG and I have to say I'm impressed.  A word of warning tho, it's not really all that Mexican.  It's more South West which is fine with me.  There are plenty of good Mexican places but finding a good SW restuarant in Phx can be a challenge.  We started with the Green Chile Tamale appetizer which was topped with chunks of seasoned roast pork and fresh salsa.  For an entree' I had the Pan Seared Red Trout which was served on a bed of green beans with fresh spinach, and fire roasted tomatos & peppers.  The it was all covered with some magical sauce that makes it all come alive in your mouth.  My companion had the North Central Chicken which had a glaze that's very close to a molle' and served with mashed potatos and asparagras.  We topped it off with Butter Milk Pie which takes sweet to a whole new level.
All this and 2 drinks for less than $60 and excellent service.  Let me be clear, there's nothing here that really wows me, but it's a big step up from every Mexican/SW chain in town.  We'll be back!
