HshPHJ-OJ0rpVR-okV55Rg Food was great. Good prices and friendly staff. My husband loves the tacos and enchiladas and I really like the 3 way burro and chicken burro. The salsa is the best. Love it! Good place to come try it sometime. There are other locations, in Chandler, Gilbert, Tempe. I have been to all and always loved the food.
