I ordered through the phone and they gave me the wrong order, which I realized after biting in to my burrito. I let them know and they kindly offered to remake it. This took another 20 mins and they gave me a wrong order yet again. Gave up at this point as it would take another hour to sort things out. TLDR: avoid during busy hours if you care about getting what you ordered (especially if you have allergies or food sensitivities)
