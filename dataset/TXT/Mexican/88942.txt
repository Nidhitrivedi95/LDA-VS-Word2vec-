DO5mQxiBOgHEznosjxvJXw When this place opened it was the bomb. Now not so much. It's food and quality has gone down immensely. Would we come here again, most likely not. Must be that the chef has changed. Whereas the food was fresh and exciting, is now the same as any other restaurant on the corner. We staff used to be very attentive and salacious, now you have to flag them down for everything. I wish them well in the future and I hope they come back to their opening day glory but I am not hopeful.
