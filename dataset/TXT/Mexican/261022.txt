VRwT0pscR5vESCrAnUpNwQ This place was recommended to me by my banker. I thought, "OK, the guy handling my money says to spend money there. So this must be legit". And upon that thinking I tried out this restaurant a few blocks past spadina, West on King street. 

First off, the way you order is very much like freshii (clipboard style). Once you give your order, you are provided with a strange metal order inductor that you bring with you to your table or seating of choice). 

So while you wait for your food, I encourage waltzing (perhaps not in actuality) to the unlimited salsa bar. And try the different salsa. The expression of the cartoon fellow above the sauce name suggest the hotness of the salsa. 

The quesadilla was great, the shrimps were well cooked and the overall crunchiness of the qursadilla was what I enjoyed, and it went well into my hands.  The accompaniment of house made guacamole and sour cream was good as well.  

Will go back!
