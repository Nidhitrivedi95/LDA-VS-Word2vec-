The cons: all the prices went up, which means it's no longer a ridiculously good value. This used to be the kind of place where you could buy an excellent, satisfying lunch by scrounging together the change in your pockets. Now you're looking at a minimum of $6 for two tacos, and that amazing $5.99 three taco deal is $6.99 now. Not a huge difference, I know, but it's -just- not quite cheap enough anymore to go there on a whim. The burritos also jumped in price from $5 to $6.95, which is probably the most disappointing thing of all. I loved how you could get a cheap burrito here that was tasty and filling but not the size or price of the more common massive ones from places like Fat Burrito and Chipotle. 

That said, the pros: the whole place looks nicer, which addresses a common complaint in reviews. Also, the menu makes a lot more sense now - the old one was out of date and didn't always have accurate prices. They added fish tacos too, which are very good, and seemed to up the portion sizes of all their tacos. Now the three taco deal has A LOT of food and isn't really necessary unless you're very hungry, or unless you're going there for dinner. So you pay more now, but everything is a little better, and you get more in return. I miss going there for insanely cheap eats, but hey, restaurants have to keep up with the times.

Overall, this is still one of the most underrated taco places in the city and definitely in the Kensington Market. It's no frills, no hipster nonsense, just absolutely amazing, well made food. 

Oh, one thing: I would be so happy, and probably a lot fatter, if this place decided to stay open late instead of closing around 7 every night.
