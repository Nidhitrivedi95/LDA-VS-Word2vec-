Voeq7aGDmCGMjE_SQiHwRA I first visited Bakersfield with a group of eight people on a Wednesday. I was worried about seating so we arrived early, about 4:20pm. Many of the small tables were already occupied, but all four large picnic bench style tables towards the front were free. We ordered a few baskets of chips, salsa, and guacamole. Both salsas (a sweet, smoky red salsa and a creamy cilantro salsa) were huge hits with everyone. I ordered the bistec and short rib tacos which were both delicious, but the bistec taco, with super tender meat and chipotle slaw, is what will keep me coming back to Bakersfield.

My second visit was with five people on a Saturday evening before a Pirates game. We were immediately seated downstairs in a big, comfy booth. This time I ordered the Willie salad, which is like a taco salad with a lime vinaigrette. It was SO good!

Like other Yelpers have mentioned, the margaritas are extremely sweet. Each time I have gone to Bakersfield, I've ordered two margaritas. And both times I've had a stomach ache afterwards. By now I have learned my lesson and will try something else next time.

Overall, I was very satisfied with both my visits to Bakersfield. The Downtown options for a moderately priced dinner with a big group are pretty slim, so I'm sure I'll be back to hang out soon.
