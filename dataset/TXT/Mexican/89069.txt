dOkrbSdJ3FxXhGqdOHgL9A Amazing local taco place that has a socal style vibe. They have home made chips, both corn and flour, which are amazing. Strongly recommend all the guacs and salsas but the "scorch the earth" is my fave. Its pretty spicy and a little sweet. I usually get the street tacos, they have shrimp, 2 types of fish, and several pork chicken and beef and veggie options. They also have a series of specialty tacos burritos and bowls. Only dessert I saw is the sweet thing was churros. Over all one of my fave lunch spots, a must try if your on the east side.
