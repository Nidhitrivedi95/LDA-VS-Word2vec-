qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A OMG! I had dinner there last night and it was amazing. The service was great and the food was out of this world. I had fried chicken with creamy jerk gravy...all I can say is yummy!!! I also had a tropical fruit desert...so good. Prices were reasonable for portions and quality of food. Great place.
