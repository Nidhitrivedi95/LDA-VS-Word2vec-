_Kd0kQ8RF70hJ1ykLqCRyQ The food is great love the place, BUT ordering for a catered lunch has always been a disaster. We always fax the orders in ahead of time, now the orders are done online (days in advance) and they never have the lunch ready for pickup when we request. 
We ordered a lunch with 20 items to be ready at 11:30 for a noon lunch and when we showed up, they haven't even started working on it!!
So after 10 min of confusion and searching we waited about 20min. 
Having lunch 30 min late for a business meeting does not make anyone look good.
