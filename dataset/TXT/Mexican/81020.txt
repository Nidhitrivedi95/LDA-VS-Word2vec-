czJKX4DmZR_1JeRmPcnmbQ Came highly recommended by my local friends! Stopped over for a quick lunch..wow this taco stand was amazing...pork chicken and beef done differently....BBQ, grilled, mixed with chorizo, chilli, pulled, minced...omg!! Took a while to make up my mind...could not make up my mind so ended up hogging like a pig...tried almost every selection they had. This is legit...authentic stuff. Tip...he is going to heat the traditional tacos on the griddle and put the meat on it...don't just go inside and loading up the tacos with the condiments. Take a bite and decide if you want any or what condiments would you like on the diff meats. You will be surprised how good they are just like that too! Choose wisely the condiments...
