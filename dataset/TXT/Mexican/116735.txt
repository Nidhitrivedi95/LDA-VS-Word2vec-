gldPX9ANF5Nic0N7igu2og I went to meet with some friends for margarita    Happy hour. I didn't stay long enough to review the service but I did stay for a taco. It's nice that they offer $3, $4, and $5 taco choices but the flavor was not for me. 

I come from Texas where Mexican and tex-mex restaurants probably outnumber Starbucks so I was pleasantly surprised to have found a few restaurants nearby that mirrored those delicious dishes. The only downside outs none of my regulars had happy hour, which brought us to this establishment. Their taco fillings were definitely on the experimental fusion side but tasty. There was one my friend ordered that was completely vegetarian but tasted like pulled pork! Sadly any delicious taco can be crippled with a not so tasty tortilla. The surf n turf taco I ordered was served on a flour tortilla that tasted like those processed package ones you'd find at a grocery store, not like the homemade fresh ones mama makes. If you are going to buy from the store, it's best to just purchase corn. It would surprise and disappoint me further if  the tortillas were made in house.
