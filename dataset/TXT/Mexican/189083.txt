Great location
Outdoor patio
Great layout
Food was AMAZING
Staff was very helpful even when very busy
Great service
Great first experience
Price
Design

Cons:
The patio felt a bit busy
Didn't know about the restaurant until a friend showed me

Summary:
Great service and food, also great decor. I assume it's all about who you are with, but I will come back to Macho Radio Bar another time and see if i have the same experience. I want to give it 5 stars, but need to go back once more.
