3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ We came here on a Thursday around 6, and it was super packed. The hostess said it was open seating near bar and gestured to the whole area, but didn't differentiate if the high tables still counted. She rudely told us otherwise. 

The happy hour drinks were good, as was the street corn. The red beef enchilada wasn't as flavorful as the other reviews said. But the grilled steak burrito was flavorful.
