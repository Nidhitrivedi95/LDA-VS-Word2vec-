DMwU0igEs9K7XuI3utsr6g Food is edible. Wish they still had their crab cakes! Expensive but it's the airport.  Marci is the best! She's super fast and friendly and I will definitely be back if she's working!  People who come on here and write bad complaints about the staff are super bored with their lives. If you've never had an off day or bad day, then you are one lucky individual.  Dealing with the public isn't easy, esp in their Airport where everyone is in a hurry and thinks they are priority over the one next to them
