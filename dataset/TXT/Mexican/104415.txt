fdS9moyk-R84-DgY5xrCRg Stopped here on my way home from school in twinsburg for a quick snack and I wanted to try it out. I got the carne asada taco with guajillo corn, tomatoes, and cilantro and a side of avocado crema on a flour tortilla . The meat was super tender and had lots of flavor. The medium salsa and condiments went together really well. Overall very happy to have a fast casual taco place like this near me!
