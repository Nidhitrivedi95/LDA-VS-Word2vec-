cUFBO-5Fgd7pR0JUakWXSw I like what they did to the former Bobby's. The restaurant has a great ambience and the food is very good as well. The guacamole appetizer at the table was prepared to order and quite good. I like their chips as they are of the thinner kind. I had there chicken taco as my main entree good but not great. However my wife's steak taco was excellent and this is what I am ordering next time. The waiter was a terrific guy with a great sense of humor. Lastly the climate in the restaurant was perfect not chilly and not warm.
