The menu states that all the locations are family owned and operated and the recipes are family created as well. I was expecting much better food for a family run restaurant, the carne asada burrito I had was bland, lacked flavor, the rice was greatly undercooked and still hard, you can tell it was made long ahead of time and not freshly made. We also had the enchiladas, which were good, but again, lacking flavor. In general, the food had a frozen, then microwaved, taste to it, I was expecting much more from a family recipe restaurant. As an appetizer we had the fried tamale bites, which were good, but super sweet almost to the point that they were not enjoyable. Overall, Macayo's is ok, I've had much better Mexican food in the valley, not somewhere I'd go again though.
