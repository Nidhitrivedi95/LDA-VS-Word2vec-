QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA It was our first visit and everything was great. Aly was our server and she was great. Good personality, made helpful recommendations, and was very efficient. She even helped us check in for our free margarita.  I has the Thai Chicken Nachos and they were great. Everyone else in our party loved their food as well. We're going back again today for breakfast.
