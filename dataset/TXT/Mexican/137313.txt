The venue itself is very clean, and it's easy to walk in straight to the register if you've placed a pickup order.

I just picked up lunch, and as usual, the food was fresh. I even tried the queso finally, nervous after all of the bad reviews... but actually, it wasn't bad!

Overall, all well-managed location.
