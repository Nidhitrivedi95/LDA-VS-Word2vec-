Db3CfZWrtG33UZSs8Tdlsg Tasty, fast casual Latin street food.  The menu can be overwhelming at first but everything I've tried is good.  I recommend trying an Arepa.  Also, the nachos are an extremely good bang for your buck - one is really enough for two people.  The space is pretty small, and this can be problematic for Friday lunch or Taco Tuesday.
