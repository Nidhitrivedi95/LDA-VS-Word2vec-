oOGLDf2rzeCPS7UQ8hhPlQ Just tried their sushi burger! It definitely lived up to all the hype. The rice "buns" were the perfect accompaniment to all the fresh ingredients inside. The fish was incredible, and the dressing just pulled everything together. Would definitely recommend to anyone willing to try something new.
