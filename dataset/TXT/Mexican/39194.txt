6C_8Mh4lmLc_QEs3hHleBg If there is such a place as chicken Nirvana I have just discovered it at El Pollo Supremo. Your dining choices are chicken or beef either which are excellent they are served with beans spicy salsa and pickled onions all of which only adds to the incredible experience of other entree you choose. This is a cash-only establishment so bring $20 and a date and prepare for a feast that will blow your socks off. My personal recommendation is the chicken which will come out slightly spicy perfectly crispy and ready to make you swear off all other chicken restaurants all together. It's not fancy it's not expensive it's just amazingly good.
