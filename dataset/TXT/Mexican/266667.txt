WGkqfp1-3130v8xhCb3APg Taco Tantos has some really great food at an even better price. I never question the quality of the ingredients like I might at some other typical Mexican restaurants. Everything is always fresh and delicious. I highly suggest the sweet potato tacos/burrito. Also, they've got a lot of vegetarian and vegan options.
