fL2vdjn-ApNcsVntxtg4Dg So I dragged my partner to bingo at the Fiesta Henderson last night and pay back was going for Mexican food. I did not want to go to amigos as the previous times we had been there the service and food were really poor. I was pleasantly surprised, the menu has changed and has many great additions and the service has improved greatly. I am pleased to say this is back on the list of my local hangouts. The Carnitas were delicious.
