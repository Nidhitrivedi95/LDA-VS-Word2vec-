CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q Holy hell, I want to make sweet, sweet love to these tacos. It was well worth the 40-min-one-way drive from Henderson. We got the chorizo, adobada, and carne asada tacos. Each one was a party in my mouth - a party catered by Hubert Keller.

In all seriousness, these tacos were amazing. I've loved Mexican food most of my life, and having lived in the southwest, I thought I'd gotten a pretty good sampling without actually going to Mexico. These were fawesome and made me a little sad that I had "wasted" 88 tacos' worth of money at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon the night before. The meat was succulent and flavorful. We requested "everything," so each taco came with its own unique combination of fixings. I was a little nervous when I saw the heaping guacamole, but it was quite good and accentuated the meat flavor well. The giant rotating adobada is the first thing you see when you enter, and it sets the atmosphere perfectly. There's one giant counter. but there are four separate lines (in front of each grill) for ordering. Be mentally prepared to receive your tacos in hand in less than 30 seconds.

Do not be tricked into going to Los Tacos which is right next door. I haven't tried it but I can only assume it's inferior. I mean, it has a drive thru for God's sake!
