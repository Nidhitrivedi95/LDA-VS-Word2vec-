423AAbu0yBoDMOeVwnLzkQ Have been to Camino twice and finally a place downtown that is chill, good food and different then a pizza, wing and beer joint.

Had both the chicken and steak tacos and they were fantastic.  Service was great, plenty of people to help us on the busy nights we were there.

Love the location, close to everything.

We will be back and bringing more peeps with me...can't wait for the patio to open!
