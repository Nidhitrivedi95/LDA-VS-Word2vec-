a9aW5e731lplWGHUZ02-zQ I really want to give a higher rating because the food is great, but I've had my Just Eat delivery order cancelled by them twice. It really sucks when you're starving and stuck at work and you find out the burrito you ordered isn't coming. Yesterday I was willing to pay over $18 (including delivery fee, HST, and tip) just for one burrito. I was that desperate for a meal at work that wasn't pizza. But alas, no burrito for me. 

Why be on Just Eat at all if you're just going to cancel the orders?
