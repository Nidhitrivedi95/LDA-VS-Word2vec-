iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg Was walking through the Kensington and passed by! My boyfriend and I had a taco each, as there weren't really places to sit and we just wanted to have a quick bite. I had the beef tongue and beef head meat taco and my boyfriend had the grilled octopus. THEY WERE AMAZINg. The taco was such a good portion and crazy flavourful. They pack so much meat into the taco! A definite try but keep in mind there isn't much space to sit!
