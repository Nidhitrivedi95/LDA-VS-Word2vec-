SEjyjYlMfFFzkHaru6JadA The only downside from this place is that they use store bought shells for their hard tacos. They literally look like dell taco shells. If they would have made their own, it would have been better. The meatballs in the albondigas soup also tasted store bought. Service was okay, after we were done we waited about 15 minutes for the check. Everything else was very good. Loved the three different choices to dip the chips in (salsa, cilantro sauce/salsa, bean dip)
