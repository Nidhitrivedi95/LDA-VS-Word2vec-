K-uQkfSUTwu5LIwPB4b_vg I was expecting big things after hearing how great this restaurant was. I had visions of a Rick Bayless style restaurant here in AZ. The margaritas were excellent as was the street corn and tables side guac. I ordered the duck confit with a peanut mole over some hominy with cheese. It pretty much all disappeared into the sweet duck glaze, no savory from the hominy and no spice from the mole. Just sweet. The duck meat was perfect though. The person I was with ordered the pork tacos for two. It was dry and bland. 
I'm guessing it was an off night. A high price to pay though.
