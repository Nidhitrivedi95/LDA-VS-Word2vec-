TxQBdyDktZSk1KVTWh71dw We went to Babalu to celebrate a friend's birthday.  There were 7 of us and we were seated at a high top right next to the bar.  You think being next to the bar would mean high traffic of our server and also fast access to drinks.  Unfortunately, this was far from the case. 

We informed our server of who's birthday it was, and ironically, everyone at the tables got their cocktails except hers.  When asked, (our apps had already come at this point and we were about 35 min in) they said hers would take a little bit longer even though she ordered the same thing as others at the table.  Her drink finally came but the 2nd round of drinks took about another 30 minutes.  Sitting next to the bar, we could see they were busy, but there were 3 people working behind the bar.  When we asked about our round of drinks, our server told us the bar ran out of ticket tape so lost the order (I then saw her run to the portal and put the drink orders in.)

On the plus side, the food was pretty good.  I had a seared tuna salad.  The tuna, although a small portion, tasted fresh.

For our friend's birthday, they brought out a signature dessert and this little sparkler candle that was cool to see.  But what struck me as odd, is the dessert was put on everyone's bill (to split).  The $2 for my share (and one bite) isn't going to break my bank but I've never seen a restaurant charge for a birthday dessert before.  Especially at a table that has already been spending heavy with apps, meals and drinks.  

Even though the food was decent, I cant say I'll be hurrying back anytime soon.
