D9Uf7UmU2KlgS_H8lJwOrA Soooooo gooooood.
When I first walked in, I was a little skeptical. Was afraid I was going to leave with a stomach ache. But boy was I wrong, the burritos were AMAZING. Dare I say this... possibly better than Burrito Boyz.
Everything is fresh and made to order. Very well priced.
I made the mistake of eating here before my 3 hour lecture, which eventually became a 3 hour nap. (P.S. don't wear super fitted jeans - you're gonna walk out with a burrito baby)
