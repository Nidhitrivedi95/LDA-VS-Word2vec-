We ordered several items from the menu that included the fish taco's which were outstanding. We also had homemade refried beans (one of my fav's) that was delicious & the Guac was clearly house made & scrumptious as well. They also had some house-made flavoured water that was very interesting & tasty. We ordered way too much food but everything was great. This is a definite do-over!
