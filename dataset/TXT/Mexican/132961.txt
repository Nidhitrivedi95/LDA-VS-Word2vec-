iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg I was never a fan of Mexican food until I had this!

The carnitas taco was amazing! I'm not a big fan of pork normally, but this was my favorite. It was packed with flavor. The salsas are amazing too. Plenty of heat with amazing pepper flavor. 
The fish taco was good, but paled in comparison and I usually prefer fish tacos. Only disappointment was not being able to try the other tacos as they sold out.
