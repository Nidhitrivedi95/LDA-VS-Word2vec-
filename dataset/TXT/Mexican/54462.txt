9t8PEynZGVCG1EjOQr1xBA Chicago style windy fries have got to be one of the best Carne Asada fries in Las Vegas. I absolutely love crinkle cut fries and Chicago style taco shop uses crinkle cut fries to make their Asada fries. You can choose any kind of meat you want for your fries two different kinds of cheese, and the portion they give you is really good.

If you haven't tried Chicago style taco shop then you need to take a trip down there and try their food which is really delicious. I highly recommend this place, try it for yourself you will not be disappointed!
