80gdzmn-E3IaXK7Z6qzC6A Solid Fresh Mex restaurant. Nice selection of pork, chicken and beef dishes. Guacamole was way too watered down; but besides that, the rest of the ingrediants were good. I tried the Mango Chicken. The Manago sauce was flavorful without being overly sweet. The chicken was moist and the torilla was excellent. A definate repeat when I'm in the area
