UJb1PrUWDFfuzwUPc1pP4Q Didn't realize El Hefe has an absolutely ridiculous dress code regarding Jordans.  As my friends/family waited in line,  security came up to my cousin and advised  him he wouldn't be able to go in due to his "basketball shoes"...I then stated to him they are Jordans. He then looked at me and asked if I knew who Michael Jordan was and said he played basketbal haha and said they were "basket ball shoes" therefore he wouldn't be able to let my cousin in and was saving us some time NOT to wait in line..... I didn't see any strictly enforced dress code on El Hefe website regarding Jordans. It's absolutely crazy to turn down any man just because they are wearing a great brand of shoes.  I definitely wouldn't bother referring anyone to El Hefe Tempe.
