EP1do6l8hLyIGEru0gN3EQ While a tad pricey, Johnny Mango's eclectic collection of east meets west cuisine seems to have been imported from the west coast.  But, being an import means that what might seem common on one coast, may be quite different on another.  

My visit was on a crisp spring afternoon with relatively prompt service, a pitcher of Sangria and glass of Caperinha.  I like their caperinha more than Brasa's, but less than Sarava's.

I also had their Pad Thai which left me pleasantly surprised.

It's not haute cuisine, and the attention to detail in the food probably doesn't justify the price; nevertheless, it's a pretty fun place to eat and relax, and the food was passing fair...
