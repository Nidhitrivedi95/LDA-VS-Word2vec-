8ou6p7T-3KaNOhDeln3Ccg Enjoyed my first visit here over the weekend - I had the Fresco Burrito vegetarian style with fajita veggies added and the sour cream and cheese removed. The burrito was a good size, had great flavor, and had a nice slight crisp to the outside. I loved trying the different salsas, but some were much tastier than others. 

My husband had a chicken burrito that he said was pretty bland. He wasn't impressed but said he would try it again. I MUCH preferred my veggie burrito here than at the Other Burrito Place. 

My one big annoyance - I asked to leave the sour cream and cheese off my burrito but they charged me for the lettuce I requested. Seriously? I just SAVED you some money!
