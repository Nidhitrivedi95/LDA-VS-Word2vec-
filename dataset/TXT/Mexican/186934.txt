We ordered a pitcher of the "amber" margarita, crab cakes, chicken tinga tostadas, grilled fish tacos and the tres leches cake.

The crab cakes were on the small side, yet really appetizing that led  us to crave for more of what's to come. Both the chicken tinga tostadas (2 pcs) and the grilled fish tacos (3 pcs) were really really fresh and tasty. I also liked their variation of chili sauces on the table (chopped fresh chilies, chili chipotle, red and green sauces), and yes they were indeed HOT - which were perfect to complement any dish you order. The highlight of the meal was the amazing tres leches cake - satisfyingly moist, decadent, and refreshing all at the same time!

Overall, the food looked like they were not much portion-wise, but don't let that deceive you. 

They have an amazingly tasty and authentic food with great ambience, it'll make you forget you're stil in the city!
