SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA We really enjoyed this place! Food was yummy, and VERY filling. You get what you pay for and then some. 

Service: Chips and salsa were also filled, food was fast, and waitress was nice. 

Environment: We went at peak times so it was a little noisy, but did not take away from our dinner in any way! Wonderfully decorated as well. 

Food: We both had fajitas. So much food! We almost could have shared. If I was into that food sharing thing. Meat was cooked well, and tasty! Felt like we got more than we paid for which is always a nice feeling.  
The chips and salsa also came with a bean dip which was a nice surprise. 

Overall, it was excellent and we will go back sometime!
