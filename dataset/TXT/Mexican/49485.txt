8nNB_yG1gzVpbqNH2EBucg We went here for lunch today with the padres as they are in town for a couple weeks.  The place was dead at 1 p.m. on a Wednesday afternoon during some school's spring break.  

We were seated promptly.  Z'Tejas carries the Republic of Tea drinks, so some of us ordered Pomegranite, I ordered the decaf Ginger Peach.  They served us a skillet cornbread (guess that is their specialty "bread basket" )  For lunch I had the cup of soup: Gumbo was on the chef's soup special today.  The broth was thick, the sausage was spicy, the chicken was tender and there was just enough rice to consider it a gumbo.

I also had the Z' salad which was a small mixed leaf lettuce with tomato, green and red bell pepper, parmesean cheese and their own string like crutons.  I got the ginger vinegrette on the side.  It was just enough to fill me up, but not make me unbutton my pants. LOL.

The rest of the group had variations of enchiladas: mushroom, chicken and cheese.  The lunch plate size is very good, and included rice and choice of beans.  I am glad restaurants are finally sizing DOWN the portions!  I am tired of doggy-bags that sit in the fridge only to be tossed out.
