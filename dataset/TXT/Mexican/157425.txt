KLvpdtFYUi1I0LNsmIqeJw Oh hello to the happy staff! 

The steamed dumplings are to die for.  House fried rice..  Yeah add that to the 'things id eat every day if I would collapse and die from a heart attack'..  and the crab ragoon keep doing what youre doing for those tasty nuggets. 

Prices are a bit expensive for the area but the amount of food you receive helps off set that a bit. 

Great little quick spot when youre craving something oriental.
