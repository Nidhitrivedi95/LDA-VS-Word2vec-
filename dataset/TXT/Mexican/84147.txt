d4qwVw4PcN-_2mK2o1Ro1g I  can't believe I took so long to review this place.

Hubby and I went to Vegas for our anniversary and stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel and Pink taco was one of the highlights to our stay there. We ate there for breakfast, lunch and dinner lol.

The service is amazing! You can eat inside or outside and we chose outside every time. We love the view of the trees and the shade from the pink umbrellas.

They give you complimentary nacho chips and dip before your meal and the salsa that comes with that taste amazing. 

One of the best items on the menu has to be the turkey burger. Not your average turkey burger. This one is in a pita with a special sauce and cheese. Trust me you won't regret it. Thank me later! 

The prices are great and the next time we come, even if we don't stay at the hard rock, we are definitely coming to Pink Taco!
