We were planning to go to the perch, but fortunately for us, the perch's kitchen is still undergoing renovation, so we happened to discover this place next door! It's only been open for 9 days but the place was hopping. They have a large patio that encompasses the perimeter of the indoor seating. On one side of the patio there was a birthday party going on. We sat in the patio the other side. The decor was pretty inviting with flaming lanterns and hanging string lights. Also, another thing to note, is no matter what angle, there was a tv within my sight.

We started with a dragoon IPA, which is pretty good beer from Tucson. We ordered the blackened chicken nachos, the Arizona Ave sandwich, the clubhouse sandwich, the cluck Norris flatbread, and some grilled cheese for the kiddos. 

I'd recommend the chicken nachos. They were so good! A little on the spicy side and really crispy chips. I'd also definitely recommend the Arizona Ave sandwich. Though a bit messy, the flavors really come together in this great sandwich. I got asparagus as my side, and they were cooked perfectly as well. 

Our server was Skyler and she took care of us, and checked on us often, which I always appreciate. The owners, Mike and Mike stopped by every table checking up how everyone was doing. Really nice, funny guys wanting to open up a nice place where you can go to watch the game. Great place!

We plan to come back to try the wings!
