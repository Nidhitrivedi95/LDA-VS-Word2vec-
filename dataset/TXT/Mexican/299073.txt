zjvnqTjBp56NhMp1GrlO5g Went to First Friday again, and this time we roamed around a little bit instead of just hanging out at Bar + Bistro at The Arts Factory. We happened on a sign for a restaurant called Mingo Kitchen and Lounge, so we decided to check it out.

THE DECOR (4 out of 5)
Mingo has seating both inside and out including an outdoor bar as well. On the inside it seemed pretty dark and dimly lit, kind of like a club. However, we opted to sit at one of the tables outside. Sure it was with plastic chairs and all but I didn't mind. It was a nice evening, and we had a decent view of what was going on near the Arts Factory.

THE FOOD (4 out of 5)
I was really impressed with their food offering. We had ordered some edamame ($5) which had garlic, red chiles, lime, ponzu and sesame sea salt that I thought was good. Next was the grilled blue point oysters ($14 for 4 oysters) with garlic greens, ginger jalapeño aioli, bacon bits and red chile sauce that was delicious. And lastly since I was still hungry, I tried the Kanye hot dog ($7) which was a Chicago style bacon wrapped hot dog with pickle relish, onions and peppers which I'll definitely order again. 

THE SERVICE (3 out of 5)
Our server was nice and helpful with our menu selections but it did seem to take a while to get our order (especially with some of the beer orders). While it did get busier as the night went on, that's no excuse for having to wait sooooo long just to get a drink, right?

OVERALL (4 out 5)
Well, we've found our new restaurant spot during First Fridays, so if you're there and want an alternative to the food trucks nearby, you should pop in and give the Mingo Kitchen & Lounge a try.
