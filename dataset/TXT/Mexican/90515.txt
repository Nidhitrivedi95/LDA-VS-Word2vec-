K. Back to our regularly scheduled review. What does $20 get you at Las Lupitas? .... A lot.

For $20 I was able to get:
- 1 lb bbq beef
- 1 lb chicken
- 1 lb warm corn tortillas
- pico de gallo
- salsa

...  If you're not into measurements and the specifics of my order, just know it's a lot of food. Enough to feed 2 adults ... Twice. 

... If you're not into quantity, know that the quality of the food is great too. Real flavor. Real authentic. If recommend to any body looking for some good Mexican food. It's definitely worth the drive.
