lXYTzkRVMHPYGcDRc_8JvQ I love that this place serves non-gmo product and is one of the only fast food chain out there that doesn't serve any gmo food. So if you want something quick natural and healthier than your typical fast food chain then check out chipotle Mexican grill. The burrito they wrap here is humungous, ginormous and unfold able. You will not starve eating here. The majority of the food here are pre-made but warmed and veggies are fresh. The concept reminds me of a fast food Chinese take out similar to Panda Express where you have an array of entree to choose from but of course the Mexican version. 

This particular location wasn't on top with filling up there grilled onions. I wanted grilled onions and bell peppers on my burrito bowl but noticed a dried up empty bowl scrap onions and peppers I opted out of that because I didn't want 2-3 pieces of old onions and peppers and didn't have the patience to wait for fresh ones to be made. 

I took a star away from poorly managing what needs to be refilled.
