scEnuZvnBMNPxQ8m4KLVHw I love Mexican food. I once worked in a Mexican restaurant in Mexico. However, Montreal doesn't have a great variety of Mexican restaurants. A friend of mine who studied at Concordia told me about this place and I immediately wanted to try it. 

We went around 4PM for a large snack/early dinner. The place was empty so we had a very large table just for us. However, I'm sure that on Thursday night, the place is packed. The seats were very comfortable and the music was good. 

We shared a plate of nachos and I had the chicken taquitos. Both are appetizers. The nachos were really delicious and spicy with the jalapenos peppers. There was plenty of cheese, salsa and cream cheese. Yummy. 

There were 4 taquitos in my plate, about the size of cigars. They were good, but maybe a little dry. They came with a side of super spicy salsa and cream cheese. It was okay. 

We shared the fried ice cream for dessert. They had a good selection of sauces. We chose chocolate. It was big, but just enough for the two of us. 

My bill came about at $16 just for me. It was good, and much better than 3 amigos or Carlos & Pepes (whose salsa has strawberries in it, by the way). 

I'll definitely go back. Next time, I'll try the pork burritos, which my friend has strongly recommended.
