cNhg02JDqlEbCF4EsXHrPQ My husband, 3 year daughter and I went to Lonestar in East Gwillimbury Tuesday night. Cowbell was our server. He was personable, attentive, friendly and our food was prepared perfectly. JD, was managing, and was also very kind and checked in with us often. We had a great time and definitely will be back again very soon!!! Thanks Cowbell and JD! From 6-shooter, Brass Spurs and Dirty Horse.
