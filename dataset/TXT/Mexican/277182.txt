Our server last night was a tall Hispanic guy, dark hair, big framed glasses, facial hair-- wish I knew his name to give him proper credit because he was awesome. So incredibly kind, attentive, knowledgeable of the menu... fantastic service.

Bone in ribeye was actually okay. The stuffed chiles that come with it are pretty delicious but super spicy. The prickly pear margaritas were the star of the show!!! One of the best margaritas I've ever had in my life.

Great vibe with good music, people dressed to the nines in typical Vegas fashion. My husband and I really enjoyed oursleves! Mostly because of the awesome service.
