TxQBdyDktZSk1KVTWh71dw Where do I start? The decor and ambiance is decent and the menu has some interesting dishes. 

Places like these are hit or miss for me because they aren't a particular cuisine. This place has mexicanish, cubanish, Spanish food among other things. 

I opted for the Cuban sandwich, which was quite good. My girlfriend ordered the Mexican street corn, calamari, and empanadas.

The Mexican street corn was good. 

The calamari which we ordered as an app never came out until after the food. They comp'ed the app which was good i suppose but I am not looking for free food, I am looking for good food served promptly. Strike one. 

The empanadas were initially served at such a greasy level it was not edible. We notified the server. They remade them and they were good the second time but it somewhat ruined the experience cause I had my food and my date didn't. 

The refills on the soda were abysmally slow. 

Food quality and service need work. 

Not sure I would be excited to go back but when the food is made right and on time the flavors are good.
