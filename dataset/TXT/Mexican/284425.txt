xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw Yes I drove 30-35 minutes to The Fry Bread House because of indian fry bread. We went to Payson recently had it there and really wanted indian fry bread!! Has anyone had it? If not, you need to! Since we made the drive there we decided to try their indian style tacos - the beans, cheese and toppings were surrounding by a lightly fried and fluffed "shell" - it was delicious! We did sit down inside, different environment than what we are used to (sticky everything and different crowd of people). You have to give this place a try regardless.
