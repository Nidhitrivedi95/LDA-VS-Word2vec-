aXRrMXXoAN7lawHICgmsxw My new favorite restaurant. I loved it. The food was food. The weather was good. The lighting was good. Everything. The only thing I didn't really enjoy is that a loud party of 6 were seated next to us. The tables are so close together...I felt like they were in my conversation and I was in theirs. Other than that....this place is great!
