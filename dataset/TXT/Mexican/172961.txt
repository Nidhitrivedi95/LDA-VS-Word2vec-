mES9E5K4HbYoPFXGv0pUuw I feel bad about what I am about to write because the workers there were friendly.  But here we go:

The Good: 

- Chicken tacos are the best tasting among the tacos. 
- My friend was high on weed and loved the food (but then he drank a glass of water and said that was amazing).
- My other sober friend liked the Chicken Adobo.

The Bad: 

- Beef quesadilla is bland.  After the meal it felt like I just ate a pot of beef boiled in water with no seasoning.  
- Tacos do not have hard shell and are made from the exact same soft shell flour as quesadilla, so get one or another or you will be ordering two of the same. 
- Chicken taco better than pork taco better than beef taco.

We will go back again to try the Chicken Adobo and if that's good we will go back just for that.
