oxv2UyI5yF6yawPU20tOxA This place is pretty good. I've had a real hard time finding decent Mexican food in the valley and for once, I found a place that didn't disappoint. 

The atmosphere is fantastic!  Best I've found in the Phoenix area and the service was spot on. 

The food is pretty good but there are things I'd do different. Such as their use of aneheim chiles in their green chile dishes and sauces rather than authentic hatch New Mexican big Jim's...  but, I've found that most Arizonans hate anything spicy, so I understand. That's a Sonoran thing...  Part of being a successful business is knowing your market.  That said, as far as Mexican food goes, this place lands squarely in what's known as "southwestern style". Which, frankly, is a nice break from all the "Sonoran" style places around the valley.  (Sonoran is a Spanish word that means "bland") (lol)

The chips were average but the house salsa was pretty good. Nice flavor and a bit of heat. I asked for "something hotter" and was brought a ramekin of their habanero which had plenty of kick!  

For my main dish I had the chicken enchilada dish and the server told me the green sauce, even though not hatch green, was pretty good. I was skeptical so I ordered "Christmas". Once I explained what that meant, I got a dish with both the red and the green chile sauces. The red was pretty basic but the green, even though not hatch, was delicious. 

Moms had the old town tacos, which she said were delicious and Costa had the penne con pollo which he devoured. 

All in all it was a great meal and the staff didn't seem to mind a bit that we hung around for three hours even though they were pretty busy for a weeknight due to cooperate events they were hosting. 

Although the place is a little pricy, I can't wait to go back to try more stuffs!
