cUFBO-5Fgd7pR0JUakWXSw We enjoyed our recent dinner at The Mission. However, it could have been much better and we left a bit frustrated. Due to aggressive upselling and pushing, we over-ordered. First, the server totally skipped the taco page when she "walked us through" the menu. That should have been our clue that clearly she wanted us to order drinks, appetizers and the more expensive entrees. Then, she said the tacos were so small, that we should add a forth. Maybe, if that is all you are eating. But, after chips and delicious salsa, guac and other food, the tacos were more than enough for those who ordered them. We were so full, we didn't finish the tacos and barely ate our more expensive entrees. The server realized we ordered too much and took something off the bill. I appreciate that; however, it really wasn't enough. Due to her pushing, our bill was still at least $25++ more than it should have been. Also, being so full and not able to enjoy our meal and the birthday dessert put a damper on our enjoyment. I would go back, but beware of Simone. Advice to Simone--happy diners leave better reviews and better tips. Don't work so hard to pad the bill.
