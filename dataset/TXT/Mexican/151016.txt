Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ This place is really nice. The only thing that's a disappointment is the price you have to pay for beers and the food. I would say, it's slightly over priced.

I got the fish ceviche, which was really good. It has mango in it, so it's not traditional ceviche but it was super tasty, nonetheless. 

I went there for the karaoke, which was super good. It doesn't last long so get there early, but the DJ is very nice and the sound system is phenomenal! 

Definitely going back to this place.
