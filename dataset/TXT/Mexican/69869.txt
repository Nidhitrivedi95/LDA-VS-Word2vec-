BToSTEiaK94G3h5_XROEcA To start off, I am in no way or kind a Mexican food expert, but I will say this is my to go place when I am craving Mexican food. My to go plate is the taco lunch special, I've also tried the chimichanga and they are both really good. The people here are welcoming. It's clean and fast service. Food normally takes 15 minutes to be ready and they provide chips. 
They have a huge parking space which is a plus when you're on the run.
