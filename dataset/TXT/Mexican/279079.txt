XQRqEueK3br2lXRtBQPN6g The first time I went, the employees were wonderful. Took their time and was considerate. The next time I went the employees were completely rude. The taller brown haired girl rushed me, didn't give me time to think, and was rude. The cashier guy didn't even acknowledge me other than wanting my money. The 3 stars are for the previous staff. Not for whoever I got tonight. They SUCKED.
