iBCMaNm_hv9IlCDa7AWPig Mangos Mexican Cafe is a great little place in downtown Mesa, west of Milano's Music. The interior is cute, but is showing wear. There was obviously a leak in the ceiling, and is destroying the mache sun in the ceiling center.
You order from the counter, then they bring your meal to your choice of table. Breakfast is great, as are the other meals. Everything is fresh and hot, with perfect flavor. The heuvos rancheros are ine of my favorites. The salsa is good - with an almost chipotle flavor. The chips are bottomless, though not warm. Service is good. You seldom run dry on your beverage or chips.
I recommend that you get an agua fresca while you are there...fresh fruit watera/juices. My personal favorite is the sandia (watermelon).
If you want good Mexican food in a quaint, quiet setting, give Mango's a try.
