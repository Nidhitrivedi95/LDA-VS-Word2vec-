Iw9k29FJCZ0fC68oxK1NtA Taco Tonto's is one of our favorite places in Kent to eat for lunch. Tacos are amazing. Usually stuffed to the brim with your choice of veg, meats, and toppings. Kevin is great with customers and always friendly. The problem is when Kevin is not working, the food and customer service goes way down hill. I have been here multiple times when he's not there ... and the food is mediocre and the customer service is lackluster. I would give this place five stars if it wasn't for these concerns.
