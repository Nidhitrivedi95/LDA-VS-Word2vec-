Our guacamole and chips took a while to come but when the server realized they hadn't appeared yet, he was upset and went and got them ASAP. Then brought us some salsa to say sorry. Overall, a good place to relax and have a snack. Would have loved to have tried more of the meal options, maybe next time!
