BhdmSnBo9903lIYGh_x3kw I hate to tag on but the drive through is very slow. The person that took my order seemed confused. I asked for a K6 with a Dr Pepper. She replied, ok what do you want to drink. Then she said "what else". 

She ask me what sauce I wanted and I ask for BBQ. They gave my hot sauce instead. The food was typical of most kfc restaurants.
