VVeEiDBnfekolbs8FzAD7w Came here for Sunday brunch/ football. Good service and would like to try more dishes. Original setting and spacious. I'm told at night it transforms into a place where you can dance for nightlife. Update: Recently came here and this time service could've been better. The waitress was very nice but came back 3 times asking for our orders to make sure she had them right. I wasn't worried about mine as she seemed to remember mine just fine as she repeated back the orders. I was wrong. The wrong item arrived and thankfully a friend offered some of her food, which I took so I don't awkwardly watch others eat while I wait for my order be corrected. Writing the orders down would've helped. Had to rush through my actual food once it arrived (correct this time) since my friends and I had to leave for a game. I decided this would be the perfect time to use the 75% off coupon offered through this app after check in but it turns its not being honored. (The coupon was too good to be true.) On the bright side I wasn't charged for the wrong plate at the beginning which a friend gladly took it.
