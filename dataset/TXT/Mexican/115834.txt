GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog One of the biggest disappointments in Las Vegas. The concept mixes Street Asian food and Street Mexican Food. The concept with "To Go" windows on two different sides for both cuisines is clever and I was thrilled to try this place as I love street tacos and I'm a huge fan of José Andrés. If he came to this restaurant to eat he would be ashamed to have his namesake on this venue between the less than average food and pathetic service. We ordered a few of the tacos at the window and it took THIRTY MINUTES for four tacos! The restaurant wasn't even busy. If it took street vendors that long ANYWHERE they would be desolate because no one would wait that long for street food! Totally ruins the whole point of ordering street food from a window- if we wanted to wait that long for food we would have sat our butts down in a booth somewhere. After the build up and anticipation from the long wait we were starving. I figured it's José Andrés so it will be worth it once we get the food- perhaps even up there with Kogi. Unfortunately, the food was terrible. The tacos were messy to eat, and somehow with all of the sauce and food packed into the taco, it still managed to be terribly bland and there was absolutely no flavor. Hard pass on this place!
