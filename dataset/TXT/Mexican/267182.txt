wJ84TZZTuT0EdLzPHt8RDw Visiting Phoenix and stopped here for dinner on our way back to our hotel. The food is typical in terms of quality that you can expect from chain restaurants. The food was good, but not exceptional. The staff were friendly. The prices average for this type of restaurant. Generous amount of food.

I had the steak fajita quesadilla. It was more than I could finish. I liked that is was served with guacamole, sour cream and pick de gallo. The chips were served with two kinds of salsa. My youngest son really enjoyed his cheese enchilada and beef taco. He particularly liked the beans.

My husband had a beef enchilada and chicken taco. He's the only one who ate everything on his plate. He liked his dinner.

My older son had the carnitas dinner. Very generous amount of food. Couldn't finish it all.
