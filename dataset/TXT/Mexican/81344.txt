d_L-rfS1vT3JMzgCUGtiow Excellent meal from start to finish. The coconut mojito and orange margarita were great. Enjoyed the appetizer platter, entrée, and dessert which were all flavorful and delicious!  Also the guacamole is made fresh to order at the ceviche bar.  I would highly recommend this restaurant if your in the mood for Latin food / Mexican
