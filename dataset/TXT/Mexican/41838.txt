70WDApYtMcLlrnb1EUW6fg As for Mexican food...let's just say that I meet my quota.  So I was quite surprised to find that a meal at La Hacienda was my favorite of a recent trip to Scottsdale.  There was not a single aspect of the meal that wasn't outstanding from a food standpoint.  First, I'd recommend starting with their El Diablo spicy margarita -- a pepper-infused beauty that really kicks things off.  The tortilla chips were a perfect delivery vehicle for their salsa -- a nice and spicy chipotle and a more normal, but fantastic, regular salsa.  I had the chipotle shrimp, which was delicious and yet almost outshined by the simple corn base it sat upon.  Others in our party raved about the shortribs.  I closed the meal with inarguably the best flan I've ever had (and I've had my share). This is not a particularly fancy restaurant, but don't skip it if you're here...

One related comment.  I read one review dinging the breakfast buffet here.  I never sampled it, but I do know that it is run separately from the restaurant -- totally different staff, etc. -- so I wouldn't hold a bad breakfast against La Hacienda.
