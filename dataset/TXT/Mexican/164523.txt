lJvcWyi6_vGWVavWkMrbVw Great salsa for starters, chips were fresh and hot.  Tried to order off the lunch menu for dinner but no dice. Had the macho burrito, which was my first try of cactus.  Was impressed by the presentation and large dollop of fresh guac, a well spread green sauce smothered the filling burrito!  Didn't even miss the rice and beans I hoped would come as a side.  Appreciated the prompt and courteous server!
