How about Baja blast? Out. Ok, Pepsi? Out.  Ok cherry Pepsi. Pulled up to the window and the person asks me if I'm the one that got the fire thing. What? And then finally, just to top off the whole experience, they were miraculously out of straws. In the middle of the day, they were somehow completely out of straws and beverages. I wasn't even that mad, but actually impressed by the level of incompetence displayed here.
