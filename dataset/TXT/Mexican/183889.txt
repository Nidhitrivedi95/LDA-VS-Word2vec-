While nursing our water in shot glass sized portions on a wobbly table, we came to realize that they had forgotten our order. Upon realizing this, the food came out randomly, leaving some of our group finishing their orders while some were just being served. They forgot one of our party's meal altogether and brought it out with the cheque and no apology. When asked where our change was after waiting for roughly ten minutes the waitress shrugged and said they were closing and it would take some time. Although they had the best intentions I'm sure the service ruined the entire experience. 

The biggest highlight was the washroom - real nice.
