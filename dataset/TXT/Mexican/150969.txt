Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ John bartender at this joint is by far welcoming and responsive.  Although it was a short visit dude took care of me and I am very appreciative....Dennis Rodman was here during the night however it was calmly handled...it was my birthday and John took care of me....appreciate the restaurant vibe as well as John.
