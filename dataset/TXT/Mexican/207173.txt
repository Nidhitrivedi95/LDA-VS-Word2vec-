q6igRYs2UTO-4nTwlttrAQ Visited Pancheros for lunch one day last week with some coworkers. I know they're known for their fresh homemade tortillas, but I opted for a bowl. Perhaps this is why I wasn't wowed? Anyway, the bowl was good, steak a little on the salty side, but overall tasty. I had hopes for lettuce, pico, and other fresh toppings, but there was queso... I'll give it another try and see if the tortillas help to give this place another star or two, but based on my first visit, I'd say it's a good (but not great) spot for lunch.
