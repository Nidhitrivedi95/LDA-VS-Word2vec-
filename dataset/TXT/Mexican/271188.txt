WpI5MZC3XzlTpcUOKXzCbA Only reason I've gave them 2 stars is cause the view was nice & our second server Rene was caring and attentive!  Our first server was rude and looked like he didn't want to be there I felt discriminated cause we were a young couple half way down our meal he stopped coming around and i saw him and another worker standing and pointing at our table laughing ! After that he just stopped checking on us I stopped Rene and he helped us the remainder of our dinner. Food was bad and our anniversary dinner was ruin
