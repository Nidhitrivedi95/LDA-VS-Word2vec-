Lu11ceuxJWh3dgRaPZGbsQ 1 star - So I come back here several months later to give it another go and well the 1 star continues....The guy serving must like pretty girls. The woman in front and behind me got very generous portions. The guy behind her and I got about 1/4 - 1/3 less. The funny thing is I didnt even make the comment. The woman who was with me laughed and made the comment. 


1 star -This Qdoba has gone down hill. They have cut the portion size down per bowl by about 30-40% but the price hasnt changed. This happened about 9 months ago. I thought it could be a one off but several times later still smaller portions. 1/3 to 1/2 a cup of meat in a burrito bowl is ridiculous. Also a nacho bowl with half a spoon of queso is pretty dismal.  After 15years of Qdoba, time to go to the competitor over the road.
