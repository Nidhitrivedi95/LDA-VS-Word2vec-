6C_8Mh4lmLc_QEs3hHleBg I'm tellin' ya, if the Internet and Yelp existed in the 80's, they would have retired me as The Duke, 'cause I was here at least 3 days a week when I went to ASU.  20+ years later, they haven't changed the recipes: tortillas are tasty and served hot, chicken is juicy and tasty and comes right off the grill, beans/onions are yummy sides, and the salsa is my favorite of all time/anywhere!! I repeat, best salsa EVER!

Cheers!
