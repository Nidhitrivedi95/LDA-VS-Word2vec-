ZLrDrRo1Vy03HJka4KVb9w I went to Old Mexico at Century 3 mall with my girlfriend for Cinco De Mayo. It was our first time there. The food is the typical Mexican that you'd find at places like El Campesino. The place was extremely busy due to it being Cinco. I ordered the enchilada, taco and chile relleno meal. It comes with beans and rice. They did screw up my order though, I ordered the chicken enchilada and got beef instead. Another odd occurrence was that the food came out lukewarm. I'm used to the piping hot plates that come out at most Mexican places. My girlfriend ended up getting the chicken quesadilla which was good. Their white queso cheese is outstanding and a bit spicy. The guacamole was not very good at all, it had an off taste to it. The salsa was great though with tasty tortilla chips. The margaritas were excellent. Overall the food was pretty good, slightly below the quality you'd get at El Camp. Service was efficient, no complaints. All in all, we'd go back to Old Mexico for another try, probably after they move up the road to their new location since Century 3 mall is a dead zone.
