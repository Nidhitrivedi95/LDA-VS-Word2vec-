ySBvgchqN-sJmvUQVcTpnw This del taco is never consistent with the way they prepare food.  I ordered carne asada fries twice, and the first time they were decent but the second time they were horrible.  Only "5" pieces of meat and the rest was soggy fries with cheese. Wth!!! Who actually even bothers to add meat. If I had a count on how much meat they put just at glance.  Then there is something definitely wrong.  Won't go there again.
