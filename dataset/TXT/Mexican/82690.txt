d_q4avZYM1sOlQP7noJKVg I love eating at El Guerro Canelo most of the time is at Tucson when I come from California. I didn't had a chance to stop by so i came to the one in Phoenix I love it also but it seem that the bread from the Sonora style hotdogs didn't feel authentic but the food still taste good.
