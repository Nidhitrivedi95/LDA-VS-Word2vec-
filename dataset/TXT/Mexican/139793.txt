J5ebC7fKqrSF8KuS8d6hgw We showed up at 6 pm on a Saturday night, party of 8, no reservation. It was busy, but no one waiting for a seat. They were able to clean a couple tables and quickly put them together for us. Service was great, as was the food - trout, salmon, osso bucco, etc. Great mix of flavors and we enjoyed how the food was cooked although some might find it more on the well done side.
