Ta'Carbon is not only clean, fast, and delicious, it's about the only real tacos in Phoenix. The staff are friendly and bilingual. 

I would recommend the wire plate or alambre in Spanish. It's a mixture of cheese, onion, peppers, bacon, and beef with your choice of flour or corn tortillas. A side of beans with cheese and an horchata to drink and you won't regret spending a single dime!!!
