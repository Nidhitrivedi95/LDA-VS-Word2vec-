Ns20WGWn6s6niKAGIQB4UQ Whether you're coming here for lunch, dinner, or a show, this place is great! First there is the food. TACOS! Do you love tacos? The answer is yes, and the solution to lack of tacos in your life is Crescent. The bean dip with chips is also very delicious. 

If you're here to see a show then you're gonna have a great time. The venue is intimate and you can see the stage from anywhere in the room. There is a bar inside the ballroom that is quick to get you a drink so you can get back to dancing the night away. The staff here is amazing and know how to run a busy venue. 

I love coming here and I am excited for the new venue the owners are opening across the street.
