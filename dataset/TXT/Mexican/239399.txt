T2tEMLpTeSMxLKpxwFdS3g I couldn't have asked for a better first meal in Charlotte! First of all the NODA area of Charlotte is simply amazing! Such a huge melting pot of cultures there, and great shops! Front and center I found Cabo Fish Taco and decided to eat there. Taco's are my favorite food ever! 

I tried the salmon taco and the lemon pepper shrimp I couldn't tell you which was better because they were both AMAZING! I also had a pineapple hard cider which blew my mind. 

Definitely check this spot out!
