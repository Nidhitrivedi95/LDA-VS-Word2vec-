MyTsAeShB9pcWP84GSTAdw My favorite 2 types of foods. Mmm so good. I accidentally ordered a lot of food. The veggie chow fettuccine was that flat rice noodles. It taste like chow mein but different in a very good way. The fusion chimichanga was so delicious with the red sauce that's poured on top of it. I loved how the cheese was still melted with the beef. Customer service was fantastic. The lady was helpful and cheerfully friendly. I definitely will come back and recommend friends to go. Also I saw a sign there from 3 to 6 is half off beer. Might have to take a look into that.
