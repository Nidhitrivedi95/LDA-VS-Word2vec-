rXUZNVlpWMV5ORDDSguOEQ Honestly I was scared to try it at first because the outside looks really sketchy. We walked in and say down and they brought the chips and salsa. Which the salsa was amazing! Me and my husband have deemed this our new favorite restaurant. Everytime we have date night we go here. Amazing food and service!
