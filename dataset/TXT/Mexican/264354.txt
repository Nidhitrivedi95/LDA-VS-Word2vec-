Wc9UpJhOcdSj7olZkz7SJA The Stand is a great place for when you need good food to go. I've tried their short rib tacos, chicken tacos, standard burger, and French fries. Everything is good but the short rib tacos are definitely my favorite. They also have some of the best milkshakes I've ever had. They are so thick and creamy. I love to mix their chocolate and banana shakes. The drive thru line gets long and I wouldn't call them speedy or "fast" food, but the wait is worth it.
