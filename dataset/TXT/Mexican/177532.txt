mss-LiOfL1vtoNo3WoEoJw Visiting the Phoenix area for Dodgers Spring Training. We knew we wanted to eat Mexican while here so I Yelped Mexican food and chose Kiss Pollo for the 5 star ratings. We weren't disappointed. I ordered the Kiss Taco and Papa Taco. My daughter ordered Kiss Papas. Both delicious!! Nothing left on our plates. We thoroughly enjoyed the unique combination of both chicken and pork. We don't have that in California. We might come back before we leave. Highly recommend this place. The owner was very friendly too, a plus!
