xlXwxfiUD4bgJFKUYwkzOg Borracha is the best place to get a strong margarita and some great food!! If you're there for happy hour you must try the blood orange margarita or "The Heat of the Night" and the chicken nachos with a side of guacamole. They bring you fresh chips and salsa that is just amazing! Nachos are served in a cast iron skillet smothered in cheese sauce, shredded cheese, pico, and chicken. It's not one of those plates of nachos where you kinda have the scrape cheese or toppings off of other chips that have a ton of stuff on them. Not a sad lonely chip in sight. I came here with family so we ordered a bunch of stuff on the menu. 

Tried the street tacos, one chicken and one beef. So good. Perfectly seasoned and not too much fuss with the frills. Like an actual street taco. 

Guacamole was REALLY good. Tad on the salty side, but the second bowl was better. (Yea we had two! Don't judge) lol. Topped with a little slice of radish and crumbly white cheese. 

Atmosphere was pleasant and lights progressively dimmed as it started to get busier. We also had amazing waiter!! She was adorable even though I never got my lime in my margarita. Lol. In all honesty she's (Ashley I think was her name) the only reason we stayed so long. My dad got there about 4. Happy hour is 4-7. We left around 9:45. Lol. We just sat and ate and drank because that's how enjoyable the service, atmosphere and food was. 

If you're ever in Vegas and just need a place to chill in the cut for a bite and a drink, or you want to get lit before the club, this is the place! Turn up or turn down, they are where it's at. Just request Ashley and you're set!
