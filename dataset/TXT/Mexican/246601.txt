twrgw3ZaMEiS87sN5ahuuw My pregnancy cravings have finally kicked in and brought me here! It is so clean inside and the staff is very friendly! The chairs are really big and comfortable. Most of all the food was AMAZING! We got a fry bread with beans, cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. A carne asada burrito with beans and rice. A bean and cheese burrito. And a plain fry bread. What I really like is the different salsas they give you with chips! They also have a little station where you can add whichever toppings to your plain fry bread if you would like. The portion sizes were HUGE! So you will not leave here hungry! It was also so so so delicious! I'm probably going to go back again within a few days because it was so delicious!
