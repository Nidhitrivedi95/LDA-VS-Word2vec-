QF2P3oJqCJC9z0TPDDFVxw I thought the tacos here were just alright. The main issue is that the meats (beef/pork) we had weren't seasoned very well. Also, the fried fish taco looked and tasted just like a fish stick. 

Also, the rice and beans that came with the taco plate weren't seasoned very well either. 

The majority of the seating is outside, and the inside seating is very very casual to the point where they probably could a bit more with the ambiance. On my next stop back in Las Vegas I'll find another spot for tacos.
