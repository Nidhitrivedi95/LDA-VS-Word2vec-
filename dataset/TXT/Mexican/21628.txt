2g6x4ISNiMxFnotBuwmZmw A great place for meeting your friends, particularly if you like a lively environment.  Televisions everywhere -- obviously a great place to watch a Cardinals game on Sunday.  I especially like the "No Firearms Allowed" sign by the front door: my kind of place -- with the margaritas they sell here!

The food is good.  The margaritas are good.  ¡Ole!

Good customer service.

Prices are outstanding.

It was very warm in the restaurant, so it's not clear to me whether the inside restaurant is air conditioned during the day.  When we came in (early evening) the doors were all open: it was only 95° -- but it is a very dry heat, huh?
