gOBxVkHpqtjRRxHBIrpnMA i would comeback JUST for the great service we came in 5 minute before close and i know i hate that too but we were so hungry and every other place closes at 10 as well so we get in and the staff is super chill and nice we mixed up orders and they were so cool about it and one of the sstaff actually paid for our chips and guac since its our first chipotle experience! also prime location i must say
