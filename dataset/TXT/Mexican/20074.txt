1ZJz840L496LAmQdeDv0WA Very meh. The food wasn't bad. But there was nothing special about this place. I would have been just as happy to have eaten at Robertos, and for the price would have gotten more food. Honestly very average food, works in a pinch when hungry, but nothing to go out of your way for.
