IyrDnrvUKpndj5zIv1KvGQ Salsa had hair in it, yuck! This was not worthy to be called Mexican food, the only good thing was the coffee, it had an authentic taste. I would never recommend this place to anyone. My take is that this place is not authentic and caters to tourists who think they are going somewhere with quality Mexican food....not! Plus, the prices are over priced, it's ridiculous they would charge $4.50 for a single tamale, the most generic at that! I was totally blown away with their high prices and poor quality food.
