mB_cI1tCrNxxvr2e2myNrQ It's Taco Bell, what more can you say. They serve beer/alcohol ~ so what!!!! The music is so loud no one can hear when their names are called for food. If this is the "flagship" concept count me out for ever returning. I like to have a conversation with friends when eating, NOT a headache!
