VRTrhsYKSJo1kGX5RqBlFA Very good. Went for lunch on a weekday and the place was pretty full, but we got seated right away. Our server was casual but attentive (never breathing down our necks but genuinely asked how our lunch was). 

Had a three taco plate - probably too much for lunch because it includes beans and rice - but there were too many good taco options to not want to try at least three. Had a ninja pig, avocado and bacon, and korean beef. All three were good, though the Korean Beef was excellent (I could have had three of these). 

Anyway, yeah, good tacos, good service, no complaints here.
