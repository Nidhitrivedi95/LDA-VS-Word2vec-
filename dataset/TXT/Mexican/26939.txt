3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ Beautiful atmosphere and very friendly, attentive service.  Our group got a variety of tacos and sides.  The salsa trio offered with the chips was very good, very unique tasting.  Make sure you try each one.  The street corn is out of this world.  The guac is divine.

My only wish is that they'd offer more vegetarian items so my boyfriend could get something other than the veggie taco.  The veggie taco is a nice thought but pretty tasteless and was his only option.
