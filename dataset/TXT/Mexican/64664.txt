b3ZZPx8jMC1DR2GR89ivzg My friends and I had such a wonderful experience here tonight! The workers were so friendly and helpful and the food was sooo good! We had a great conversation with the store manager who I expressed to that I wanted to try the cookie dough dessert so he personally went back and made it and brought it to us, it was so nice! I was so surprised and not to mention the fried cookie dough was AMAAZINGGG. Even though we live 30mins away we will for sure be back and I highly recommend, especially this location. Thank you again to the manager for making our experience special :)
