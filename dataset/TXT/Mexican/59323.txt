AhPmh0NaRDbEYyhd9egzLA This restaurant is one of my absolute favorite places to go.  The food and service are great. I had a problem with the nachos and the manager (Larry)not only fixed the problem, but was so warm and genuine.  Hire for personality and train for skills.  You always feel welcome, can you tell I am a regular? The drinks are interesting and delicious and you can't beat their happy hour.  I usually get the fish tacos no slaw and extra sauce.  My husband and child love this restaurant as much as I do!
