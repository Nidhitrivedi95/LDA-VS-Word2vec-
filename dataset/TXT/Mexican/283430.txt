XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Had lunch here on a Saturday afternoon.  Had a couple of killer cocktails, and started out sharing the Tiger Shrimp & Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale - excellent!  My husband had the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash, which he loved, and I had the 16-Spice Chicken Salad, which was really good.  Good service, lively atmosphere.
