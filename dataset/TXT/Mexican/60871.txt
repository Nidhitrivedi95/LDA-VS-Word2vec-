ApWggpJxz6yvVccJURF7MQ Feeling lazy I went here for Sunday dinner, but was pretty disappointed.  Now I looove Mexican food and I thought a restaurant specialising in Mexican food would have got it right, but the food was pretty dry and tasteless.  Everything seemed to taste the same too!? 

Staff were lovely though, really helpful and funny!  So we left a nice tip, but only for their efforts, not the food.  Decor was clean and contemporary and you had a view through to the kitchen, which I always like.  

Went for nachos starter to share, actually this was ok, if a bit dry, probably the best part of the meal, but you can't really go wrong on nachos - can you?  For mains we took the 9 layer tequila challenge!!  This is 9 tortilla wraps stacked on top of one another with even thinner (!) layers of refried beans, chicken, guacamole and finally melted cheese on top.  Then there was a shot of tequila sunk into the middle of the tortilla stack, to wash it all down with!  Ok, so it was the tequila that sold us on this main course and the "WE DARE YOU!" statement in the menu that got us excited!  But is was basically a mound of bready tortilla's with very little in between.  Only managed to eat a quarter of the hugemongous floury pie, just full up on carbs! 

Still, the red wine, tequila and staff were lovely, but I think I'll just stay at home and order an Indian next time!
