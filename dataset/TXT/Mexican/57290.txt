a8pmtlVKf7NiSLI-4KejIw Very disappointed. Mexican food has been my favorite cuisine for years and I've always managed to find a great place with every new city I move to, and this one is a bust. Their ingredients are fresh, I'll give them that, but $11 for guacamole? That is far too expensive, especially since the waitress mashes it in front of you, and you get to see it is not a gold plated tomato. 1 Avocado and 2TBS of onion/tomato/cilantro somehow equals $11. Hmm......

Additionally, we ordered the Tostada Bahia which does not mention that the seafood is ceviche on the menu which is clearly something that should be. It was nothing to write home about. Even the server said its not that great.

I will not be back to try a second go.
