44FSoN5Wj2B9vZTTYHlQZQ I love this place I come here everyday they've been short staffed but yet they work so hard to indulge my every need. I read some reviews on here and it makes me laugh. Almost every bad review that had a photo attached complaining about the food, the food was all gone their quick to eat it and complain or just complain because they didn't get their way. I know all the people who work and or worked here and they work hard you guys have to keep in mind their just workers they have no say on how things are done or priced.  I was actually here when all the bad reviews were written and you guys only tell your side of the story you guys were rude and demanding and quickly forgot that yes they work there but they are humans to who deserve respect. Above all the food is amazing each and every time I have came. Love you Roberto's!!!
