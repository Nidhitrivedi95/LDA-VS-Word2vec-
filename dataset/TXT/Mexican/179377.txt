MZRqxvBkJLjKcoOjNz7yLA Carne Quesadilla was great. Carne nacho was huge and good. Fajitas were good not sizzling like most but still good. They come take your photo and sell them to you. I loved it and bought one. Overall was completely satisfied. Prices were high but everything is on the strip. I would go back.
