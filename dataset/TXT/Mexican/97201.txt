EJmiKQKlWfY-0iVlya7FOQ I visited z-teca on Cinco de Mayo where they were offering $5 burritos. I understand that the typical complaint about z-teca is the long line up, which ends up building anticipation in the mind of the customer. 

I understand that feeling, for if the food isn't so great, why would people be crazy enough to join a queue? Well, on my visit there wasn't a soul to be found, and it could work both ways, -the food could have been crap. It was just a chicken burrito, tightly packed with rice, beans, sour cream and some fresh salsa. I'm not a fan of the appearance of a prepared burrito at chain restaurants, they're too cylindrical, and stuffed.  

The service was very professional and thorough though, -the sole employee was chatting it up with us making us feel really appreciated. The appearance of z-teca is very much like Chipotle in that modern, industrial get-up. They had the urban style garage doors pulled up for the summer heat, creating a patio-like ambiance, and two flat screen TVs switched to City Tv.

I could see this location being perfect for a quick lunch, without being smothered in with the food court, but I think I'm just not that into chain burrito joints.
