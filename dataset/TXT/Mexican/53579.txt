9pWzjhdrPgsZEmF7-QOaIQ Downtown T-Dot Staycation over the Xmas Holidays!  Was walking back from the LCBO and what do I see?  Tacos 101!!!   Small Taco joint with no parking.  Very limited seating.  Free samples of their house made nachos and sauces.  Hot, medium and mild.  Sample the sauces with the comp Nachos before pouring it on.  Ordered 4 Fish Tacos (Battered).  After the wife and I consumed two tacos each, we were beached.  The portion of fish in each taco is huge as is the flavor.  Dayaam they were delicious.  Garnished with Slaw and Yellow Relish (Pineapple?) these tacos were heavenly.  I hit this place up two days in a row.  Consistency?  YES.  The fish tacos come standard with the mild sauce.  You can fill up little take-out containers with their house made sauces.  Remember peeps, Chips likes it hot.  The in house hot sauce was "bite you in the ass the next day hot" so beware. Would I go back?  They had me after the first bite.  
Peace my brothers and sisters.
