gEv1Og5uGDLw9HkbKSGUZw I stopped in with a friend after attending a "Taco Festival" not far from here, (which turned out to be a terrible experience) so we were still craving some decent tacos and Mexican beer. 

I was delighted to find that they had my favourite Mexican beer (xx Amber) and they could also make a Chelada. On the menu, they have only listed Michelada, which (in my experience) is like adding Caesar ingredients (Clamato, Worcestershire, lime juice & Tabasco) whereas I just wanted the lime juice with salted rim. I've never had ice with my beer, so that was a new experience, and not something I'd do again. Just goes to show that there are many variations of Michelada/Chelada depending on the area/region a person is from. 

We ordered the chips and guacamole to start, followed by a couple of tacos and the queso fundido with chorizo, served with flour tortillas. The tortillas were greasy and stiff, but the cheese was delicious and gooey - better enjoyed with the tortilla chips we had with the guacamole. 

The tacos were delicious but very tiny (about the size of the palm of my hand) They were loaded with ingredients which made for a very messy eating experience. No complaints there, just needed extra napkins! Our server, Zane, was excellent; he answered all of our questions and always seemed to be there right when we wanted something. 

The restaurant was quite dark and the music a bit too loud to have a proper conversation, but I'll definitely return for more tacos.
