ERM603jbIbNqX2c7Ww1Qiw I ordered beef tacos and my tacos were soaked in beef juice. I don't think they drain the juice from the meat. The entire taco was soaked! The staff is really unhappy and unfriendly. But I hate complaining, because we are so lucky to be able to go out and buy a hot meal! Even if it's soaked we are a blessed people.
