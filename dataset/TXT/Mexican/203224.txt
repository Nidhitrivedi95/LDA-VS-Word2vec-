pomGBqfbxcqPv14c3XH-ZQ Well I gave Leticias a 2-star, so disappointed. 
When they first opened I loved it. Food great. 
But went this past weekend with my daughters and when they brought our food, rice/beans were a bit cold but the tacos were pretty warms all our plates.  I noticed the rice and beans was cooked and left for awhile in their pots. I'm a cook I know. So, you need to get your money's worth, my daughter paid for the dinner,  I am teaching her that your paying for this food, don't ever accept what it is.  Your a customer and food needs to be hot and cooked well.   So I asked the waiters about it and they were very understandable did take it back and gave us a whole new hot plate of food.  It looked fresh.  But there are no excuses to ever bring your customer a cold plate. I didn't get that.  That's my point. I hope that when I go there again it doesn't happen.  If it does I will walk out and not come back.  It's a shame because it's really a nice place to enjoy your food and great atmosphere.
