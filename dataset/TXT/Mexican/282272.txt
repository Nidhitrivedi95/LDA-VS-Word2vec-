XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Maybe the best dinner of my life.

My husband and I ate dinner there with my sister and brother in law back in September.  

I was anticipating that it would be expensive, and it was.  It was also totally worth it.  My husband had the side of corn for something like $8, and I thought "Eight dollars for corn?!".  And then I tried it.  And it was amazing.

He had the tuna steak and I had the quesadilla appetizer as my entree, and it was so rich and delicious I needed help finishing it.

My sister and brother in law ate off a prix-fix menu, and were very pleased with theirs as well.

I will say that the service was slower than I had anticipated, though to be fair it was a Saturday night.  The food was absolutely outstanding.  Would love to go here again, and the food is definitely good enough to warrant the price tag.
