_-FkDma7ozwx7-sYA3wAvQ I think the associates could be a little more chipper in the drive-thru. I guess I'd say this is your typical taco bell. 

I've never had any issues with my food. Sometimes the drive-thru line is a little slow, but other than that, this place is ok. Hence the 3 star rating from me.
