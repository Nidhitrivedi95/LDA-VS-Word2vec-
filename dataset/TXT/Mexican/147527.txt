jqAdZf9PJo8lsRskc6T1Sw This place is only open bc people who don't want to wait 45 min to eat at The Mission but still want Mexican come here.

The chips were stale. Really stale. Their salsa and molè were delicious but would have tasted better had they served fresh tortilla chips. My husband ordered a pop, but it was flat. He requested another one and, it came from the bar this time, so it was okay. Apparently, their pop machine is broken but they're still using it.

The food was decent but nothing to write home about. I always ask the server to give me his/her favorite thing on the menu. She recommended the combination platter. The service was better than the food. For a place in Scottsdale and especially in a touristy area like Old Town, it's disappointing. I've gotten better Mexican food at the Julioberto's down the street from my house. 

This place is tired and needs lots of improvement. I don't expect to be back any time soon.
