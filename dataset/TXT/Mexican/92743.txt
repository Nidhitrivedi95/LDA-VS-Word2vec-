e13SEvJud_vgeDR_doL4sQ The food here was terrible, I mean downright awful and flavorless. I thought maybe it was just my tacos but my dining companions food was terrible too. The drink were bad as well. The only good part of this meal was the mariachi band singing at the bar. They walked to each table and took request, even did a little Jay Z. :) 

I will never be back.
