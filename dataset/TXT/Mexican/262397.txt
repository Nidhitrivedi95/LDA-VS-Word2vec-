vz8HFGsITt6aj-nyXkAEFg First time here.  Pleasantly surprised with the combination of great food, excellent service and overall ambiance which includes live music provided by an accomplished guitarist.  My table had a view of the patio area and a pond with water features along with a family of ducks. Definitely a place to go go for that special occasion.
