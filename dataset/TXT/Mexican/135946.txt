The tacos were good, but the chicken was dry and bland. The veg crazy potato was amazing! I was scraping at the sides of the foil trying to get every last morsel because I loved it! I also tried the shredded steak gordita which was pretty good too.

Overall, pretty good. Hit or miss on some things but priced reasonably!
