Voeq7aGDmCGMjE_SQiHwRA Great tacos small and perfect bar food!! Our waitress was really nice ( Brittany) checked on us constantly and offered suggestions to drinks and food. Our waitress was also helpful in making sure we understood the portion sizes for the tacos I landed on the steak taco it was good but a little over seasoned. 

My drink was really good I got the Bakersfield sour it was really really good. Our waitress suggested the watermelon martini which we both decided to get it unfortunately I didn't really like it it was a little too sweet for my taste however my fiancé insisted on getting some Queso. I really don't like cheese as it doesn't sit well in my tummy, usually. however when they bought the Queso  out I did enjoy some of the chips and let me tell you they have the best Queso that I have ever had in my life. The guacamole came out and it was really really fresh I usually eat a little. Of th appetizer to ensure that I save room. But I couldn't stop with the guacamole it was sooooooo good. 

The environment was great the bartender was very nice In fact  we started at the bar before we got seats and the as soon as we sat down she asked what we would like! She seemed impressed when I ordered my drink:-) if in the are we will back.
