ECqc9Xd0dTdKmcNrbIizAw Traveling to Akron from Youngstown and stopped in for lunch. Excellent service, good prices and huge portions. I had the commorones ala diabla and soup. The bowl of soup could have fed three people and was full of shredded chicken and rice and vegetables, very tasty.
The lunch plate had 15 shrimp on it with rice and beans and a killer hot sauce (like an enchilada sauce) very nice.
I will be back!
