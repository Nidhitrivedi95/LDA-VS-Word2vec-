OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ Trying to curb my taco cravings, checked yelp for a taco spot not too far from the house, when I came across the review for Mi Pueblo Taco Shop and they have a perfect 5star rating. I haven't got my food yet, but the smell coming out the kitchen is amazing. It's a Friday night in Vegas, at a hole in the wall taco shop. The single file line is out the door.....Now that's a recipe for GREAT Mexican food
