zCmwErM82hdKl4L2UixDJw Barrio is consistent, solid and so cheap. The happy hour is a total bargain - tacos are $2 and margaritas are $3. It's lively but not too loud. Overall worth going to - especially if you can grab a patio spot when it's warm.

A lot of the margaritas are a bit too sweet for me. I prefer classic to flavors like jalapeño and blood orange.

You build your own tacos with a pencil and paper checklist menu, like The Happy Dog. I usually get two and it's plenty for me. Lots of great vegetarian options. The tofu is zippy (although a bit too liquidy), and the black beans do just fine. Definitely add the slaws, and get a bunch of sauces on the side to test out.
