y1VInN5m3RbHU59kiQbmxA This is a fabulous restaurant. I had the Chilean Sea Bass. It was great, not too heavy. My mom got some kind of soup with potatoes & mushrooms, it was excellent. Our friend got some kind of combo plate with beef and pork. It was great, but I liked the beef better. We got the chips and guacamole for an appetizer, they were fantastic. This is not a typical Mexican restaurant. They don't have any fried food. Their customer base leans more towards eating healthy. They said its Mexico City food. I want to go back soon. I don't know the specific names of the dishes, sorry.
