GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog No thank you...

This place has to be the biggest disappointment located at my favorite hotel & casino, The Cosmo. We came here for a business lunch and I have no desire to ever make my way back. 

Straight to the weird & flavorless food ~
Guacamole: bland 
Pork buns: weird filling with a bitter aftertaste
Chicken lettuce wraps: dry chicken
Dan Dan Mian: flavorless dish with overcooked noodles & weird flavor combos
Shrimp fried rice: bland with over cooked shrimp
Churros: dense & dry (hot chocolate sauce was tasty)

The decent dishes were the watermelon & radish salad, tuna ceviche and mango sticky rice. 

The restaurant itself is fun & colorful but the food was one sad dish after the next.
