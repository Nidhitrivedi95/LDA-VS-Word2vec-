iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg I think there's a bit of a taco craze going on in Toronto right now, not that I mind.

Stopped into Seven Lives on a Wednesday night for dinner.  We got the Baja, Cajun and Octopus tacos (all $5 each) and was able to snag the last serving of ceviche for the day ($7).

Seating is limited so we took our order across the street to the patio at Cold Tea.

I love the Baja taco and the Octopus was delish as well but the star of the show for me was the ceviche.  It had huge chunks of lobster and shrimp - perfectly seasoned, mixed with a nice serving of guacamole.  If it wasn't the last order of the day, I would have scampered back across the street and got another order.

Definitely will be back for more of that fantastic ceviche and the tacos aren't too shabby either.
