VtgFuz3LXsrGB-SzPSQbDg Came here for dinner tonight. It's a little rustic outdoor place tucked away from the road in the middle of an orange orchard. Had the brisket sandwich (the quarter pound option) with cole slaw on top. The meat was tender and tasty, and the bread was exceptional. The sandwich could've been complimented with a stack of pickles and/or raw onions on the side. Ordered a side of beans and found out only when I received my order that they were refried instead of whole. Overall a nice dinner and I will be back to try their pulled pork.
