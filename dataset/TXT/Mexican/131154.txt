iBlQvqiy5Rg2h-y9TS1yOA Went for the first time last night and really enjoyed ourselves. Super nice service from start to finish. Hubby had a beer and the carne asada entree and he loved it. I enjoyed one of the tequila flights and fajitas with beef and shrimp. The seasoning was spectacular and overall we feel it was a delicious, high-quality meal. We'll go back for sure. The only downside is that it's loud in there. If not we'd give 5 stars. Yum!
