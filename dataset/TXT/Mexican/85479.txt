DaVTuhzi6EgWStb2eAjNjA I never take the time to write a review but this was an exception! It's been a long time since I've had AUTHENTIC Mexican food at a restaurant, I was ecstatic. Everyone was really friendly, the restaurant was clean and the food was amazing! I could rave on and on about this restaurant. My favorite was the queso fundido appetizer, you have to try it! The prices are so reasonable, I will definitely be coming back. Love this place!
