Iw9k29FJCZ0fC68oxK1NtA Love Taco Tontos! It's one of those unique, hole-in-the-wall places you picture when you think of a college town. Lots of color, lots of art - and reliably great food. We're partial to the burritos and tostadas, and their specials of the day are always a fun way to try something new. You get a giant portion for the price, you can tell that everything is freshly made in house, and I've never left unsatisfied. 

The only reason I didn't rate it five stars is that the place is very small, so sometimes I feel rushed to eat and leave so there's space for new customers. But it's almost part of the charm - Taco Tontos is in an old building, with uneven stone steps leading inside (Note: not wheelchair-accessible), and you feel a lot of that character throughout your experience here.
