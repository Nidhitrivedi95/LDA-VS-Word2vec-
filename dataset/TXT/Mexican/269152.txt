woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ First stop when my friends and i drove into Pittsburgh. SO good. Ambience was so cool and the food was top notch. Gourmet tacos at their best! We had the classic guac and I had the pork tacos. Highly recommended! Pretty busy for a Sunday night, but it was worth the 15 minute wait.
