iOt7ebp4Zy-5YUjHL1rbmQ Let me start off by saying I wanted this place to be great!!! Food wasn't bad buttttttttt don't be in any rush to place your order. Saturday @ 5 and they have one person taking orders, until the phone rings. She then stops taking orders and answers the phone. Line out the door and still no one taking orders in person. Poorly managed and that'll be the downfall of this location. I never complain about a wait, but there was far too many people doing nothing to have this poor girl trying to take in house orders and phone orders. Just go to Mucha Lucha and you'll have a better taco experience
