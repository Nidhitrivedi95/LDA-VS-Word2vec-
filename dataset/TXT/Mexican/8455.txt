_rXRnGcU3RFtsehmdL0ucw We ate at Rosa with friends on a Saturday night. It was pretty empty when we arrived at 5:30, so it was surprising that service was so slow. It took about 20 minutes to be asked about our orders, and we weren't staring at our menus that entire time. They did supply us with large bowls of chips and fresh salsa, so that satiated us in the meantime.

I ordered a fajita salad with steak. It was incredibly good, and HUGE. The steak pieces were abundant and the avocado slices were perfectly ripe. The vinaigrette worked well, too. My margarita, however, can only be described as mediocre. 

My husband had the steak fajitas and found them to be quite good. Large amounts of food for a good price.

Our son ordered the cheese crisp. He didn't like it, but that was because of his own pickiness, not the fault of the crisp. Us adults had pieces and thought it was just fine, and the leftovers came home with us.

Even with the blips in service and the state of the margarita, the food well exceeded my expectations, and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. I wouldn't mind coming here again.
