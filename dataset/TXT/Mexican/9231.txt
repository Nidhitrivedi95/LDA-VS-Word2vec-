_v7lMUtdd6WlgKUEBLA_VA I go here once a week. Great fajitas with a great price- I get them every time I come! Chips and salsa are always fresh and taste great. The best thing is the happy hour- 1/2 off drinks. A large pitcher of margaritas is only $10!   Service and staff are great and always friendly.
