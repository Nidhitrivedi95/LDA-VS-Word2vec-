SW6ZQk22G1_CV81_gfnvNQ Hipster Mexican food, but still tasty. 

We had an assortment of tacos - the cod was spicy, but really good and so was the pork - chips and guacamole, grilled corn, and because it was Sunday we tried the rib special. I don't think ribs are an authentic Mexican dish, but they were excellent. 

A couple of lime margaritas and some beer topped it off and we were all happy. Oh! Try the popsicles for dessert!  Cookies and cream, and white chocolate and raspberry were a nice light and sweet ender to the meal.
