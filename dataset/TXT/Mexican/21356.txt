2g4ZTD3ePNSbDAvh6qAOKQ Yes I went here because of Man vs Food.  

Got the King Torta.  Not bad.  Tons of stuff going on.  Breaded chicken fried steak, ham, hot dog egg, on a nice tasting Bolillo.    Also have a fantastic salsa that they give you with it.

But heres where I have a problem.  Ruffles chips with it.  WTF?  Weird combo.  Anyway it was a bit overpriced too. 

But I guess when you are a celebrity because you were on Man Vs Food, people will show up and pay any damn amount.

I only go when family is in town and they wanna go to that Man Vs Food place, LOL.  I can't afford this place on a regular basis for basic Mexican Sandwiches.
