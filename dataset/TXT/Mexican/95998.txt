Eis_z-uF_2gUf83UE9blog I used to really like this place, although the customer service has always been a little sub par. 

Lately, though, it's taken a real nose dive. Two out of the three times I've visited in the last two weeks, they've been out of sweet pork or something else that is popular. 

I'd like to keep going, as it's very close to my office and good lunch places are in rare supply around, but I think I'll probably abstain for awhile. Hopefully they'll get back on track, as the tortillas are awesome and the sweet pork is ridiculously good.
