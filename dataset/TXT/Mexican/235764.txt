SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA We came here on a Saturday night at 6pm.  Not the best time  to walk in if you're hungry as we were quoted 45 min to an hour wait time.   However,  because of the wait the parties ahead of us were dropping like flies and we were seated in 15 minutes. 

We were given our complimentary chips and salsas immediately and our server got us our drinks right away.   Their selection of drinks with free refills was great.   I loved their horchata and am impressed that the refills are free. 

We got shrimp and steak fajitas for two which was so much food for 2 people.   I think 3 or even 4 people could eat from this meal.   The food was very tasty and came out super quick.

I can't wait to come back!   I'm very exited to try their tamarindo and some desserts! 

Definitely worth any wait you may encounter!
