_iEl9sCLsvXEFHUWPvgsAg Great location and atmosphere! Went in for a lunch bite today, was pretty empty, but the food and service was still really good.

Got the build it yourself quesadilla and it was like a pan of melted cheese with chorizo or mushrooms in it, then a side of corn tortillas and you literally put it all together yourself... very interesting, never had it before, but was tasty (not filling).

Look forward to trying their 3 for $10 tacos next time.
