OU5RFlwAoNaG32P-ZTlgYQ Ordered the "Grande" 10 piece meal.  It is supposed to be enough for 3-4 people.  One of my sides was salad with ranch dressing.  When I got home, I realized they only put in one 1.5 oz tiny single ranch dressing.   When I called I was told this is the corporate policy.  So, the corporate policy is that one out of 4 people can have dressing for their salad, and the others clean eat dry salad? What a joke and a ripoff.  Salad for 3-4 should come with dressing for 3-4.  My other side was broccoli.  I asked for some butter, as their broccoli has no seasoning of any kind on it, and is subsequently,  dry as hell.  Answer was we don`t have butter.  There seems to be very little thought about pleasing the customers, in this corporation's policies.  The only reason I keep going to El Pollo Stupido  is the chicken is a little less greasy than Popeyes or KFC.
