8Syk4yZRivDlVUdXxIPutQ One of the absolute worst Mexican restaurants in this town. The reason it is cash only is it has gone out of business in the past 5 years, it is tottering on insolvency cause the food is so bad. Notice no one is parked in the lot? No flavor, boring, bland are adjectives to describe the food. The food will not make you sick, but you will get better flavors from a TV dinner.
