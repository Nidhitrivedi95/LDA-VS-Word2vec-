_u1Bq7QsgMUXSMex8QHqLQ Not your traditional burrito (like we get in Southern California), but it has all the right elements. I had a Tequila Lime Chicken Burrito and it's kind of a build your own burrito once you chose the primary ingredients. I had mine with refried beans, rice, cheese, lettuce, cilantro, salsa, and sour cream. My burrito was bursting with flavor and I definitely enjoyed it. $12+ with a soda, but worth it.
