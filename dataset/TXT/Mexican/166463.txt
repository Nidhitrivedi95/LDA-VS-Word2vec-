lpD3xIYuVaQA8xRSlKwn-Q I came to enjoy some of what I was told was great food. After walking in with no apparent signs of being closed the ride bartender informed us they were closed and we'd have to leave. Even though there were tables full of guests still waiting on their food. I won't return and suggest they hire less rude people if they want return visitors.
