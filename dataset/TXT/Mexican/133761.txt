IghwtXL8ZgK2dEL62Pzhrw The best Tacos al Pastor I've had anywhere.  They load em fat as well, and double wrap so you can improvise and get two out one, especially nice on $1 Taco Tuesday.  The Gringa (Quesadilla) with Pastor or Carne Asada is fabulous.  This place wins awards for a reason, IT'S ALL THAT...The green salsa with Avocado is also very special.. A lot of bang for the buck here..
