tNJgmbODR-N0qdPGy4Vsrw I'm not one to differentiate between Mexican restaurants.  They have beans, taco meat, sour creme, sombreros, and those delicious chips that just keep coming.  For once though, I'm going to differentiate.  El Jalapeno's is hot stuff!  

I ordered the Chicken in Poblano sauce and my bf ordered the Camarones del Pacifico.  On any normal day I'd be perfectly happy with my well flavored chicken drenched in this creamy chili sauce...Mmm!  Ok, well, not completely today.  How can it compete against a huge plate of fajita toppings, a bowl of amazing chili bean spice and umm...bacon wrapped shrimp?  Yea.  I knnnoowwww..

It may be hard for the typical Yelp reader to gauge anything on this, but my bf called his meal "magical".  I don't think that's ever happened before, in fact, I don't think I've heard anything beyond the scale of "pretty good" before.  What's that mean?  You need to order the Camarones del Pacifico!  

Other than that, the meals are well priced with heaping portions, the wait staff is quick and attentive, the margaritas are strong (till you get distracted by the amazing food in front of you and realize all the ice melted and watered it down) and they had the movie Selena playing.  I love it!
