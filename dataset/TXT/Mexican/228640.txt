SAae44V24aD7y_HpgxjhPA This is a place you go when you're wanting chips and salsa, beans, cheese, tortillas etc. and you don't feel like driving farther to the Mexican places you absolutely love.

There is nothing "wrong" with Nando's- it's just very mediocre and very much Americanized , chain-style Mexican food. There is nothing memorable about any of their dishes. I don't hate it- we just end up going here when we feel like settling.
