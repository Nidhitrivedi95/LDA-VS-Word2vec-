XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Bobby Flay is not my favorite chef to watch on the food network since he mostly does BBQ stuff, but this restaurant was good for your meaty fare and I enjoyed it.  I got a steak and it was perfectly cooked and seasoned great.  My friends all liked their food also.  The only complaint I had was the waiter was a bit odd and seemed to really like one of my friends and kind of liked to loiter around and talk to us a little too much.  But other than that good place for steak.
