nveeiYhDhj0WJu1JUmx9fw This unassuming place has always been easy to avoid. ...Attached to a veterinary clinic, that's just weird. Right?
Wrong. This place is great! Family run, with solid classic Mexican grub. 
I haven't tried them since they relocated. I will update the post once we have checked them out at their new location. (We were told that the vet clinic who owned the building wanted to expand, which caused the restaurant to relocate.)
