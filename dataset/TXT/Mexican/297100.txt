zdE82PiD6wquvjYLyhOJNA Since korean-mexican food is supposedly trendy, we went to check out this new thing based on Komex's rave reviews. A definite hole-in-the-wall, but don't judge a book by its cover. The service is very friendly and their great food comes with a can't-beat price. I order the bulgogi burrito everytime and have leftovers for another meal.

I don't know how, but it just works. It works really well. It's now on my list of top 5 favorite places to eat in Vegas right next to Bachi Burger.
