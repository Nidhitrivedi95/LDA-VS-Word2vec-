0odAupWjDV8gwhaLqyh1-A First of all this restaurant is dirty, everyone was doing nothing and standing around in the back while this poor girl named Yadira is handling all of the customers and there was a huge line. Yadira called 3 times for help in the front and then they all came out (about 5 other employees) and they looked at her and went into the back again. One even came out to get a drink, saw how big the line was, and went into the back again. But hey go Yadira!
