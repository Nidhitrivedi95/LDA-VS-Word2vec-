vMyeUHW3QxbXD4_KxmwduA Ordered takeout while staying at the hotel on the corner for business. Friendly service and food was ready in 10 minutes. Still hot when I got back to my room, a short walk. I ordered carne asada tacos, which they kept calling Mexican tacos. I assume they are the same. Food looked delish but had very little taste. Carne asada has cilantro and onions, both of which the lady said were in this, but I can't taste either. The meat is fresh and would be great with more taste. I really wanted to love this!
