7NvIgf7XW55OKa5ZU7gw8Q Horrible service. Ordered the hard tacos and received hard rolled taquitos. And when I told her that I asked for tacos she said those were tacos . And I asked for beef shredded tacos and got machaca. Machaca is a mixture of animal meat. I will never return. I had not at all day because I wanted some hard Mexican tacos and I had the worst experience ever.
