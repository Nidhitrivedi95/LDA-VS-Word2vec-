eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg We were so looking forward to dining here -we were very disappointed  ! First of all you need to go into it from a back parking lot into a door that was not signed very well to know to use it. The dining room area is very small and noisy. If you want an intimate place to chat over your meal,this is NOT THE PLACE  ! 
With all the awards and positive things we had heard about the taste of the food and etc,we were disappointed. Either we didn't order the items on the menu that qualified for such awards or it isn't the way they say it is. 
The server was nice,but didn't come back too often to check out our need for drink refills and etc. We were there for the lunch time.
We noticed the cost of the dinner items,they along with others were very pricy. This place isn't located in an area of Phoenix where this pricing is justified. If in Scottsdale or other equivalent areas, then possibly but not at this restaurant.
We will NEVER RETURN to this place.
SAVE YOUR MONEY ! This place serves food that tastes like those of the "run of the mill" type Hispanic restaurants that dot the landscape of Phoenix and surrounding areas  !!
