lENkF6Cgd9WzUDBcuZcAPA I have to admit I was a tad nervous trying this place but my fears were completely out to rest. The breakfast burrito, tacos, and beef burrito we all got here were amazing. My breakfast burrito put all others to shame... it was very good, great portion sizes, good prices and everyone was very friendly.
This definitely had that authentic taqueria feel and flavor... and I should stress that this is NOT a Mexican restaurant, it's a TAQUERIA. It's well worth checking out... the El Jefe is fantastic and when my folks come to town I will be taking them here!
