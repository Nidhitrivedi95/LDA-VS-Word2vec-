ZCe93zAkxr2KOBU1NT0lmg I have been going to "The Luna" for years now and we always love the food. Best Mexican food in the valley.  We had a bit of an issue on friday night, but the Luna came through.  My girlfriend ordered her meal but it came out of the kitchen not as hot as was expected and she asked the waitress to bring it back, which she did immediately.  The manager returned with the meal but it came back wrong, different food. (at least we know they didnt chuck it in the microwave lol).  The dish had to go back again...and my girlfriend was getting a bit upset by now.  Well the manager took care of not only her meal but mine as well!  Excellent customer service!  They are always busy and sometimes mistakes can happen but the food wound up being delicious and we were very satisfied!  We will continue to be loyal patrons!  Thank you!!!
