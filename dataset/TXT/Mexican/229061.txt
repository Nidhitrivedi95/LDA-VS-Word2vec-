sbnKkn2Es06ERhPLtlNY_A So I have been to this Chipotle many times and I swear to you that I get the same thing every time.  Tonight was especially annoying since the guy on the register was rude and definitely needs to seek some customer service training.  Low and behold they burnt my quesadilla this time and every time before.  The same song and dance of "we can remake it for you."

You would think that a company that struggled with handling their food would be on their "A" game to try and get their business back.  Guess not!  Customer service and food preparation is still not on par.

So then they see that I am writing this review and bring my a buy one get one free, seriously!  I don't want to even buy one at this point.
