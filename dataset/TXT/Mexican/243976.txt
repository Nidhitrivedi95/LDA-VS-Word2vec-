thLX_k20SPJ0KyusGTBIHw Won't be coming back to this place. It only gets a star because the app won't let you proceed without it. The bartender had attitude written all over her face the moment we walked in and was absolutely rude. She took both mine and my husband's I.D. and told me my Georgia I.D. was weird but eventually gave it back. She took my husband's international driver's license and went through this book and comes back and says it's not a valid I.D. He gives her another form of I.D. and she says that's not valid either, he needs a passport. Not everyone is from Arizona genius. Like no he's not walking around with his passport on the off chance that he might stop in a crappy place like this one with terrible service. Not once in the seven months that he's been here has anyone treated him like this just to order a drink. He carries his driver's license like all the other people because it's accepted at all the other places. To make the situation even worse, the guy sitting at the bar enjoying his drink tells us she didn't check his I.D.
