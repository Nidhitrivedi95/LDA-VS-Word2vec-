TXjg3qtm6gjlbP8Iwsm4lQ It takes A LOT for me to slam my favorite restaurant chain, Chipotle, but this one mightily deserves it.  The review below me that says "Worst Chipotle in Scottsdale" is a drastic understatement here.  Living just up the street from this location, I remember it being good, once upon a time.  Not sure where the deterioration in quality went, but it's sad that "Worst Chipotle I've ever been to" is to be its final resting place.

The quality of the food here leaves much to be desired, unfortunately.  It's significantly below par and what you'd expect from good Chipotles.  The vegetables don't taste fresh.  They taste like they've been sitting out for awhile.  And their meat--especially the chicken--has an INSANE amount of sodium in it, to the point where you can't even taste the actual chicken at times.  For a chain that prides itself on "healthy" and "organic" virtues, it certainly wasn't so here.

The service here is also...meh.  They sure do know how to skimp on everything.  Given I was the only person in line and one of the only people in the restaurant, you think they would've been a bit nicer about the portion sizes.  But nope.  Had to ask for more rice, more veggies, and more beans.  And I ordered a salad for my sister and they forgot to include dressing for the salad.  SERIOUSLY?  Only one person ordering and you can't remember to include dressing in his order.  Sigh.

This particular Chipotle doesn't meet the same standards as...pretty much any other Chipotle I've been to.  It's disheartening, as this Chipotle used to be one of my favorite and also one of the more popular locations.  You're better off hitting Which Wich here or finding the next closest Chipotle location for better quality and service.
