82g1PwX5FvclqqdjJHcVNA I got here when they opened at noon and unfortunately there was a huge family in front of me that couldn't decide and when they did...their order was so big it made my wait for 4 tacos extremely long. 

However....even with the miserable wait.....I was sitting there thinking....ugh why am I here? I'm so hungry and this was supposed to be quick....well the tacos arrived after a half hour....believe it or not....I was ok with it and absolutely loved the tacos! Muy delicioso! 

I ordered Baja shrimp tacos, carne asada, and al pastor.  All extremely flavorful! The bf said his shrimp tacos were so good that we found our new lunch spot. The asada seemed like it was grilled as it had a nice bbq char on it. A couple of the bites were a little chewy but then the rest was good,  could just be that piece of meat. The al pastor had incredible flavor and was not dry...the pineapple was just he right amount. No extra sauces or anything needed. 

The family in front of me had chips and guacamole looks like they make their own chips--smelled soooo good! I want that next time. 

Felt bad for the guy working there he was the only one and the cashier didn't show up. So I wast too upset about the wait. Hopefully there's a cashier when I come again or some help for him so I can have faster service...over a half hour for street tacos was a little brutal-I was hangry.
