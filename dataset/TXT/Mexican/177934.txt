muefnimyq_3KIdEouJFvrA Best patio I've been to in a long time. Weather was perfect, company was wonderful, food was awesome and service was great. We spent several hours just hanging out, drinks, appetizer, lunch, dessert. Colby, our waitress was a perfect hostess even with all the special requests we made. We plan to make this a regular weds lunch spot. Their nearly endless list of taco recipes, and the amount of beers they offer was inexhaustible. Yep, love this place!
