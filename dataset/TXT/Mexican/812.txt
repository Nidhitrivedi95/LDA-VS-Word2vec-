-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg Don't go unless you are ready to wait for no one to know you are there. Extremely slow serving, I had 5-10 people walk by us before WE had to ask to get a drink. Then 15-20min later, WE had to ask about getting a food order in. We sat at the bar.
The place itself is a great looker, but the service is what's going to keep me away. Will not try this over priced taco house again.
