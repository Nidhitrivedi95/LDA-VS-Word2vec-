RIIOjIdlzRyESw1BkmQHtw This place is everything that Mais should be. Excellent well priced food, super fresh, super yummy, strong drinks, and very reasonable prices. About $2-3 for a taco (they come in fours), and about $9 for a super strong, well made drink. Lovely relaxed sitting, great around sunset.

So why the Mais comparison? Well it's exactly the same idea almost, but here, the service is friendly and uplifting, with people that actually care.

Read: when you walk in to T&T, the staff greet you, are smiling, and really nice. They take the time to spend 30 seconds just to make sure everyone has menus and understands the food, followed by another 30 seconds 5min later of friendly attention/suggestions, to make sure that our initial order is off to a great start. That 1min - whilst pathetically obvious on paper - is rare, and is a game changer. (Read my Mais review).

Anyway, I will totally return here anytime in the area. Fav taco place in MTL. Loved it. Simple idea, done well.
