zMdpFu7hpvrHChR7H2XCfA I just had dinner at Cozumel.  The food was maybe slightly above average for a Mexican restaurant and would probably rate closer to three stars, but the service and the friendliness of the staff really earned the restaurant a fourth star.

We were treated to a basket of nachos and some salsa within seconds of being seated and our server came by for our drink orders shortly after.  We got a pitcher of sangrias for $18 and our glasses came pre-filled.  The sangria was nothing to write home about... it was good, but I think it came from a large plastic jug... but the price was right.

I got the pablanos dinner, which is one of my favorites.  How can you go wrong with a battered, fried pablano pepper stuffed with cheese?  It was good (like I said, slightly above average).  Afterwards we ordered some fried ice cream, to the delight of our server, and it was a great way to end a meal.  I didn't even want to finish the last half glass of sangria because I wanted the fried ice cream taste to linger.

The price was great, too, with two entreees, a pitcher of sangrias, and dessert for less than $40.
