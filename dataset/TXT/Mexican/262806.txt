vz8HFGsITt6aj-nyXkAEFg Great atmosphere! While we did not have a meal here, we did sit at the bar and had Salsa (3 types), and guacamole which was extremely good. The chips were light, freshly made and not greasy. The frozen Margaritas were some of the best I've had in recent history.  I definitely will eat there (not just have drinks) next time we visit Cave Creek. Can't give it five stars as we did not have any food
