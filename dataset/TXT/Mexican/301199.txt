zS3-CKZVVvUYvasJnAg-aA Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

It's called Poliberto's Taco Shop, so get the tacos.  They compare well to tacos around the Valley.  Street-style, simply done, well-seasoned without being too salty, good salsa, decent heat.  This place is legit.

A lot of places got rid of their cabeza tacos, not here, and they are great.  Stewed and soft but still with some chew.  Next time I go, I have to ask which parts of the head they use with the hope that they use all of it.  Eyeballs and all.

I've also had their carne asada, carnitas, and lengua.  The lengua is great, as is the carnitas.  I liked the carne asada the least of the three here, but their carne asada is better than Los Taquitos.  It's a solid carne asada, just not the best.  But, based on the quality of the their other tacos, coupled with the fact that they still serve cabeza, this taqueria still deserves its 4 stars.
