lrAUseySfmFeZkWOGfsKnQ I can't begin to explain how much I ADORE WADAA TACOS! From the atmosphere to the mind blowing tacos. The steak is always seasoned to perfection and cooked with care. The set up for all the toppings are always stocked and clean. Not to mention the INCREDIBLE staff Jordan, Oscar etc have done nothing but take care of anything I need with the utmost professionalism. Also, the ease the have with relating to any and all guest Friday night 12am I stumble in to see the cashier with hickies and immediately think YES! This place is awesome! They get it! Our life's are crazy and fun and it just made me bring all of my friends and family in. If it wasn't for Oscar being so real I would've never returned or brought anyone else in. THANK YOU GUYS FOR BEING SO REAL AND COOKING FOOD WITH LOVE!!!! I come in once a day Mon Tues wed Thurs before school I can't think of anywhere else I'd rather be
