73cpMzeoX52k3-qilLmWWg Don't waste your time like I did. I found this place online trying to find new local mexican food. Drove down there and at first the owner tried to make me look/feel dumb by telling me my cards declined. After I told him there was no way that was correct he realized he wasnt getting a dial tone and that it was his fault. He did not apologize or do anything to attempt to get the machine to work, just handed me my card back, gave me a dirty look, and sent me down the road hungry. There are plenty of places in this area to get good authentic mexican food that is family owned and has their act together. I would recommend finding one of those places. I would have given it Zero stars if that was a option since I didn't even get to try the food.
