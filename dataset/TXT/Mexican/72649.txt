Cd2ERofxOeCbCi-0yDs0aw I was in the area and decided to give this place a shot. You can dine in the small shop or drive up to the takeout window, which is literally a sliding window on the far end of the tiny dining area near the counter and kitchen.   

To me, the food was just ok. I tried the frybread taco which came with either green or red chili served on top. They offered me a sample of each and I opted for the green, less spicy chili. Not many toppings were served on the taco, mostly lettuce some cheese and a few tomato sprinkles. Came served with a few different salsas in squeeze bottles, the kind you usually see ketchup and mustard served out of in other restaurants. 

I will say the service was really great. Very friendly staff. When I told them I had my own water they even offered me a cup with ice so that it was nice and cold. Super sweet and seemed like it may be family owned with the mom cooking in the back and father/daughter working the front area. Who knows if that's the case but they also seemed to know their customers personally and took time to make sure everyone felt welcome.
