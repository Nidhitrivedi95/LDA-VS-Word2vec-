MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA We had to wait two hours on a Wednesday night to get in but it was a nice summer evening and there are interesting things to do in the neighborhood.

The food doesn't live up to its hype. I tried all the tacos: really enjoyed the spicy chicken, beef cheek and pork belly: very flavorful. Rest were ok. I didn't like the taste of their soft taco. Loved their bourbon sour: so smooth and delicious. 

Their service is good, though our server did seem to want to give us our bill at various points even before we had finished our meal. But in all fairness, we kept ordering in fits and starts. 

The music is waaaay tooo loud for an eating establishment.

I had a decent time, though I think Grand Electric verges a bit on the we're-oh-so-nonchalantly-cool-pretentious. There's definitely better Mexican food to be had in the city.

 I am going with 3.5 stars.
