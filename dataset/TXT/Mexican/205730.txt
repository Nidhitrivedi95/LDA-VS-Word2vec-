pyeoyouJWxxcwzfugfessQ Found this place on Yelp to stop by for lunch on a girl's shopping day. Very nice atmosphere. Great vibes! You have the choice of inside, bar, or patio seating. We chose to sit outside on the lounge furniture, and were super comfortable. The food and drinks were great! The owner even brought our food out and checked to see if we needed anything.  We noticed that he was very involved in operating that day, which we admired. 

The only two things I could even imagine to improve upon would be: (a) our waitress was a bit slow, but they may have underestimated how busy it was going to be that day and (b) the music could have been a bit more fun for a Saturday afternoon crowd. 

Other than that, I was very excited to discover this place and plan to be back in the near future!
