fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg We went here on a whim for the trashcan nachos and they were the best nachos I've ever had, honestly! We had the asada and chorizo nachos and all of us (4 adults) ate so much but we still had some leftover, so great quality for cost. The service was amazing as well, our server was attentive and very genuine when we chatted with him. I can't remember his name but he really showed a love for the establishment and his job.
