wvlF1x7Cm8UGu6iD0LgIJw Stopped here on a layover trying to find food that was somewhat healthy which can be a challenge at the airport. I got the small chicken bowl with beans and veggies. Several toppings to customize your order are available. Food was OK (for airport food- hence the 3 stars). Would eat there again if in CLT.
