GqGVAE3kbEW46FU1LydVUg The food was good. Everytime I come here there is never anyone in the front to help you get seated.  It takes a good while at least the times i eaten here and it wasnt that busy.  The service was okay never asked if i wanted a refill.  But the food was good. Maybe i should start going to a different location and see how the service was.
