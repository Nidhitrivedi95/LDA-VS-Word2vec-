Yo yo nine oh nine one
I wanted to say hello
cause you're making great food son
your building is big and yellow
just like the sun

oh let me get that beef burrito
without a drink
munching on the sweet potatoes
within a blink
I ask myself where did my food go. 

Did any of that even make sense? 

9091 is the one of the newer gems of Las Vegas for street eats, it serves up health friendly Korean influenced items from tacos to chicken wings. The influence ranges anywhere from the large variety of vegetables, spices or the marinade used. Perhaps you should consider the bi bim bop (if available) burrito if you enjoy your vegetables. Most items will come with either tortilla chips or thin straw sweet potato fries, which I originally found a little difficult to eat because they were so crispy, but during my most recent visit they were slightly larger and less crispy, thus easier for my consumption. 
Clark is a nice guy whom you should have no problems with when ordering, and after you're done he might even hang with you outside just to talk. 

Definitely a spot you want to try out for something satisfying and simple. 

Quick note: since this is street food, you should consider having wet naps or moist towelettes with you because things can get messy when you're chowing down 9091's delicacy.
