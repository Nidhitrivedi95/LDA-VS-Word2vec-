Iu2ZINWwyrt9gXliykBEKQ Ambiance here was great.  Love the candlelight and the rustic tables. Their menu had quite a bit to choose from.  It was a pretty descent Mexican food, and from what I remember, Milgaro puts a lot of emphasis  with presentation with all their dishes.  Can't go wrong with solid Margaritas and service here was adequate.  Overall, a solid 3 stars and I'd dine here again when I return back to Toronto!

Until then, be kind to one another and Cheers! ~ :p
