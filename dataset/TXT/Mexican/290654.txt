YQFcxE9UXrKc-QuTUu7twQ Maybe we are too picky about our Mexican food but this was nothing special. We were visiting the area and checked Yelp for ideas. It was 2:00 so we tried their Happy Hour.  The place was empty on a Monday afternoon so had the place to ourselves and the TVs. Nice enough setting for a late lunch. We each ordered a margarita off the regular menu to try something different. The spicy mango margarita and the prickly pear margarita we both good but at full price neither of us wanted another. My husband ordered wings and street tacos off the HH menu, He is a wing man and said they were ok, nothing special. He tried a few different street tacos and had to doctor them to create more flavor.I ordered the Ahi salad. Everything in the salad was fresh just no flavor, too bad because it looked yummy. 2 drinks, a salad off regular menu and 3 street tacos, and 1 order of wings for $60.00 (before tip) seemed a bit high to us.
