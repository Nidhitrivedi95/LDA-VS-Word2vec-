0fyxLMASE5bfYAgW6MYM_g Should be called Bottom Shelf!  Top shelf margs were good, but the food was awful.  I ordered a la cart seafood enchilada and I needed a saw to cut the tortilla and the sauce tasted fresh out of the Old El Paso can.  My husband ordered an a la cart burro that tasted like school food.  It was a huge tortilla (definitely not fresh) and flavorless ground beef.   If you go, keep your expectations low.  This restaurant needs help.
