uYoSb2rNi77LMQZ-Nn1Epg Ive only tried the $5 special, which was 1/4 of a rotisserie chicken, with 2 sides.  I had rice and fried green plantains with it.  The food was good, and the price made it absolutely AMAZING.  If you're starving you might want an appetizer with it, but the special is soooo worth the price.
