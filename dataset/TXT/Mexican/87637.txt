DKXUkIrFnMUMF535gf-dPA So I love Mexican food and I am always craving it! I've heard good things about this place, bookmarked and I figured I would go that night to try it. As soon we I entered the restaurant I was greeted and asked if it was my first time there. I replied yes, and the 2 young women at the register made sure I saw their pictures of menu items and gave me samples of ALL of their Fresca juices to try. They were all good. My favorites were strawberry, watermelon, spinach, cucumber, pineapple, and the chia lemonade. I ordered a carne asada burrito meal with a watermelon Fresca. The chips and salsa were just ok. The burrito and juice were good. I will definitely be back. I wish it wasn't so far from me!
