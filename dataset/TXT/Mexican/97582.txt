EKGb7I6zbw7s8lYCg3HdWg Another on that list of shouldn't-really-like-but-can't-help-myself bars I currently have on the go.

Good for a party if you're out with a group on the ran-dan. Lively music spread out over a couple of different rooms (I have to say they do well to maximise on the limited space they have. For such a small venue, there seems to be an area for everything (bar-propping, chilling, dancing, etc.).

Crowd is decent. Girls might find the abundance of sharks skulking the floor a little off-putting, but when in a bigger group you probably wouldn't even notice. 

Drinks are a little pricey, but so is every other venue in a hundred yard radius so I won't hold that against them. And if you're out on the pull and you like your latinos... well, let's just say it's not just a clever name...!

Simple bar for simple times. Drink and be merry.
