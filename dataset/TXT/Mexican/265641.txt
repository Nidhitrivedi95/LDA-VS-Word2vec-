wdCH53icp_R2jJDrCZk42g This was a favorite neighborhood haunt until today.  The Margarita we paid $13 for was watery and tasteless.  The waiter swore he'd added a full shot of Gran Marnier to each and if he had it was watered down Gran Marnier.  It took 3 pks of sugar to add enough flavor to make it drinkable.

The cheese in my Quesadilla wasn't melted all the way and my husband's Machaca was a mushy glob.  I don't know what's going on there but it would be a shame to lose such a popular place.  We were terribly disappointed and won't be going back anytime soon.
