DMmeFKsUuMl0kDy7Zd7W3A Thought of starting at Zipps  ... Über driver was like no try Sand Bar. Despite AWFUL REVIEWS during the last 6 mos, still tried it out  stars based on at bar service 4\5 because no one is perfect then Le boyfriend  was like but what's holding your from a 5/5 and truth be told maybe a previous Yelp review ... I was afraid to try the food ... Nonetheless Ask for Sean he's the bomb. legit. Attentive. Speedy. And aware. What more can you ask for in a bartender?! Bucket of chips green salsa very Limey red salsa more traditional and very delicious not to mention 3.00 hefen on Wednesday... with no hoppy after taste. 4 peaks light ale ... Try it, ask for Sean the end *****mic drop****
