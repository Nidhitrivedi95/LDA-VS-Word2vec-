X57f6FWZiwI1wOidPPhOrQ Loved it tonight, as always. Staff is totally accommodating. Service is amazingly fast. And yes, some of the food is americanized Mexican, but some of it IS authentic, and it's ALL delicious. And if you tip well, they will remember you and treat you like royalty. 

Of course, there's no reason NOT to tip well, as long as the service is friendly. And when the service is as good as it is here, a stellar tip is really a moral imperative.
