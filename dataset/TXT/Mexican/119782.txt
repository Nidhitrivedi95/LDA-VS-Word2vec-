gwd1W_0Mgzqo3QxgXrt16Q Great place for live music on a Wednesday. Enjoyed the ambience, with outdoor seating and an option to sit inside the restaurant.

We ordered the queso dip w chorizo (very small portion with not enough chorizo), death by ruru burrito (crispy pork belly carnitas), fat guy in a lil coat taco (marinated steak), and the white beans.

The server gave a disclaimer that the death by ruru is really spicy which we were excited about since we're from la and enjoy spicy Mexican food. But it wasn't spicy AT ALL. The food we had was good but not worth the price points. Was surprised with how pricey tacos and burritos are here.
