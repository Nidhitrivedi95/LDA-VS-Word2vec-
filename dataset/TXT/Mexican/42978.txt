7CzA5GqrELLJyRoaJQhlGA I paid $10 for a Torta with dried out bread and chewy beef.  Not much flavor either. Was better once I added mayo and their salsa (which is pretty good). The service was good.  I have been here a few times and food is usually pretty decent. Perhaps today was an exception but the fact that I paid so much, they need to get it right every time. I will probably not be back. It's just too expensive and the food even when it is good is not that good.
