Listen, I think chipotle tastes amazing, they give you a lot of food for your money. The only disappointment is when it's 2-3 hours later and your sitting on toilet for 45 mins, trying retrace your steps, thinking how the hell did you get to this point. 

I ordered the chipotle chicken bowl. Not sure if cleanliness has something to do with it, but because it's a high paced environment, something could go wrong. 

I warn everyone that when you are placing  the order please watch the food handlers carefully. I know it's not intentional to get people sick but do your do-diligence
