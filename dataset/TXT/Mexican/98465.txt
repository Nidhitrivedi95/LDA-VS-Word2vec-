EP1do6l8hLyIGEru0gN3EQ I'm usually extremely skeptical about restaurants (especially casual ones) that mix different ethnic foods, but Johnny Mango's does a great job.  They don't claim to be or try to do ethnic foods authentically.  Instead, they use key flavors of certain cuisines and put their own twist on it.  I can't get enough of the fried rice and the pad thai.  yum!!  This place is perfect for hanging out with friends on a summer night with a pitcher (or two or three) of margarita's.  And even though the outdoor seating is nothing more than a gated area on the sidewalk, it is a fun place to relax and people watch.
A caveat - the service, while really friendly, is pretty slow.  This is not the place to go for a quick bite.
