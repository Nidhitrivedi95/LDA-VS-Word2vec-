VRTrhsYKSJo1kGX5RqBlFA Came here for their special on Tuesday, $2 select tacos and discounted beer! If you order at least 3 tacos, you get rice and beans too.

Def expect to have a wait on Tuesday or Thursday, this seems like the spot to go for tacos then. We waited about 20-30 minutes but ended up just grabbing seats by the bar.

I though the tacos were okay, the two I really liked were the ninja pig and the chorizo. Haven't tried their non specials yet so don't want to comment on the rest of the food.

Will return to try out more of their food!
