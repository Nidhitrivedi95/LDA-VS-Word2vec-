WpI5MZC3XzlTpcUOKXzCbA Love the atmosphere. This place was packed. But I have to say the food had no flavor. The margaritas were amazing. The service was ok, had to keep looking around for someone to refill drinks, chips and beans. I know people who eat here a lot and the flavor and spice of the food were missing for me. My husband had beef chimcagna and it was meat rolled in  burrito, nothing else. I had shrimp fajatis and they were just ok. I have had better. I don't like any other Lindo places and.I tried this one cause it's the original one and still a no go for me. With so many places to eat in Vegas this one needs work.
