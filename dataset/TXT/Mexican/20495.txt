I gave them two stars because most of the kids that work there are very friendly and pleasant. The service, however, is horrible. Whether there are eight people in line, or one, it's super slow and that's the most consistent thing about this place. The brown rice is very salty, and isn't very good. Some of the kids there are so stingy with the ingredients, and I don't even get meat! I asked for more rice, no need for an attitude. It's almost as if he thinks the cost is coming out of his pocket. Sadly, this is the location furthest north, so it's the closest to home, however, maybe I'll deal with all the construction nonsense to get a well made burrito without attitude.
