zMPfZdODe82SL_zxnv7asg I often compare it to qdoba. There are only a few shortcomings for Chipotle that you must note... NO QUESO which is a huge number, and also they have no shrimp/fish options. 

The burrito bowl was absolutely delicious I must say, I got half steak and half balbacoa. The balbacoa was delicious. I get less rice more beans which provides a good amount of protein. Price is reasonable and food is good.
