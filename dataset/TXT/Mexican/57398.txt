The ambiance at El Catrin is upbeat with beautiful Mexican decor. We sat on the 2nd floor on the catwalk and it was fantastic overlooking the whole restaurant while playing sick beats all night. 

The food was delightful, I especially loved the tostadita de atun, which was such a unique and unexpected flavour sensation. It's pan seared tuna with various chilli sauces and guacamole over a tortilla. Yum! The Esquites - charred corn on the cob topped with a medley of queso, aioli and lime was heavenly and filling. 

Our group even had some crickets, I took a pass on that one. 

Would definitely come back. I especially enjoyed how friendly and warm the staff is. Wonderful people, lovely ambiance. Will definitely be back.
