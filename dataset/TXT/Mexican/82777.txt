d0aLkD3VQ3sijckod-oSDg Stopped in for dinner because I wanted to go for a beer at the Beerhead bar across the street and they don't serve food. Server came and took my drink order and it took a while for my drink to come out despite a limited amount of customers. Server came back and took my order for a pulled chicken burrito. I waited quite a while when she came out and said she forgot to place my order and asked what I had ordered. I repeated my order and she said she'd put it right in. After a while my food was brought out. It was barely warm. The "Hot queso cheese sauce" looked like they had melted a slice of American cheese on top of the burrito about an hour prior.  In cutting the burrito and it's barely warm contents open there was an unidentifiable chunk of black charcoal like material. To top everything, the table was very dirty also. I would not recommend this place with so many other great choices nearby.
