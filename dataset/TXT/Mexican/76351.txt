CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q When you want real tacos, no matter what part of the U.S. you reside in, this is the shizznit.

Probably my favorite thing about this place is not the fact that they have two locations, one in Tijuana and the other in Las Vegas. The best thing about El Gordo is they offer NO el pollo items. I love it, since chicken tacos are pretty stupid. There is not enough fat and tendon juices that can enhance a chicken taco to umami levels. No chicken, I love it.

The Al pastor is Mexico City style and perfect snack between 4-5 hour gambling sessions at the Wynn and Palazzo. The lengue with a little lime and onion is perfectly braised. The tripe tacos are also perfect and feel really healthy when you have them.

I need this spot once a day when I'm in Vegas regardless of what the encore at Wynn/Venetian/Cosmo/mgm are offering in their buffets. I end up winning after eating this Al pastor.
