TCoBE_BkDRrK0bWrh5VueQ I gave it 4 stars due to the food being delicious and the employees being very nice BUT the way you must order your food is highly confusing.  If you order tacos - you order in this line - but if the tacos are vegetarian - you order over here.  Burritos get ordered over there and if you want nachos - you go over here.  Very strange way to order.

They also need to come up with a different plan on cooling their venue.  Their a/c does not cool the room enough to make it a comfortable experience.  I would go back though just for the food!
