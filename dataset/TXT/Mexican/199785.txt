pcG0vJiTtDcTb0y3pKFUZQ Never personally sat down &  tried the hooka thing, but their food is flamingly fantastic. I found this place by accident one night. I'm disabled and I do a lot of ordering out. But this place is open til 2am, the  chicken kabob is heavenly good. They include spiced potato wedged, which are BETTER than chili fries or anything else you can do with potatoes (which I'm not usually a fan of. 
 Best of all, I live 800 yrds from my apt complex, so it comes REALLY fast, the foods so fresh and hot it burns the delivery dude's hands! I order from them so much, they know me by name now! LOL
