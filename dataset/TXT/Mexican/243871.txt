thLX_k20SPJ0KyusGTBIHw The other week I went with my boyfriend to try this restaurant. I have since emailed the management as a form of helpful feedback and have yet to receive a reply. This was my letter regarding our unfortunate experience:

Tonight my boyfriend and I decided to try this restaurant due to high recommendations. The food was fairly good- but I wanted to bring a service issue to your attention. Our waitress was rather quiet and challenging to hear- especially when we asked kindly for her to repeat the item description we asked about. We were not being serviced properly, and my boyfriend had to GET UP to get the hot sauce tray himself. Finally- towards the end of our experience, we had to flag someone down to get us a to go box. I'm sure this was an isolated incident, but I wanted to bring this to your attention in hopes that other first time patrons experience a more enjoyable meal. I am constantly dining out, and I don't remember the last time the service was so disappointing. 
Two stars for decent food.
