The caterpillar just miss for its tempura shrimp being too heavy on the tempura batter. I the batter to be light and flaky. The triple S also missed on the tempura batter and not enough soft shell crab. But the worse part is you can't taste anything because of the jalapeño and spicy tuna overpowered everything else.
Service was good.
