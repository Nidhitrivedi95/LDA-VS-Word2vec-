LnIO_JtoDS1xLfTHWuV_ug This place was overall disappointing. My husband went with me, along with his parents for a dinner about 3-4 weeks ago. With the prices, I expected it to be of Tia Rosa's quality, but it fell flat. The sour cream was not normal, and the tortilla soup was basically chicken and vegetable broth (I have never seen large chunks of celery, along with peas and green beans before in tortilla soup) with strips of tortillas on top. 

The waiters were horrible! We had to get the attention of him twice, and the man who brought our food was practically throwing the plates on our table- I'm guessing because the plates were too hot. He almost made a plate full of food fall on my father-in-law's lap, but barely caught it in time. My drink was empty twice for more than 3-5 minutes; also, I asked for sour cream, and after 7-10 minutes of not receiving it AND not having our waiter stop by, my father-in-law finally got up and went across the room to grab another waiter.

The value of the whole night felt less simply because of the bad service, and I had high hopes for a new restaurant in a packed plaza which were washed away with my experience. With so much competition, this place should really be on top of their game, but is not.

Overall, the food was sub-par and service not great. Just a "meh" place. I'd much rather pay $4 more pp and go to Cantina Laredo or Tia Rosa's.
