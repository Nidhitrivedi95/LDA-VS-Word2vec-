ITOa1olD2HTgEVOnH8zVog Amaziness!!!  They don't have anything close to this where I am from in the Pacific NW.  We have My physical therapist turned me onto this place (I hurt myself moving three large rolls of carpet onto a roof and through a second story window, but I digress).  I was staying at my family's VRBO in Prescott with my father and drove down to PHX for the Business Center Costco to stock up on supplies.  I decided to up on over Chandler to try this place out for dinner.  I am sure there are better places, or maybe not, but how often do you get personal restaurant recommendations from a local 1,200 miles away .

I got:  the Machaca, carne asada and carnitas tacos; the green chili beef chimichanga; and a cheese and Machaca enchiladas.  I have nothing but positives to say about the food.  The cashier was a bit short with me, but I can't blame her.  Being new I was as quick with my order as possible, but that was probably pretty slow and this place was slammed most of the time I was there.  Mostly with to go orders.

I may have to drive 1,200 miles to try this place again.  It will be so worth it.
