D9Uf7UmU2KlgS_H8lJwOrA Bolet's Burrito location and decor don't lend it much, it's off the sidewalk in a walkway for a Rabba on Sherbourne. But beyond it's unassuming and plainly decorated store, the burrito is something much better.

I can see all the ingredients, and they all look very fresh. The cook takes her time and does everything very well. Good place to go for cheap burrito.
