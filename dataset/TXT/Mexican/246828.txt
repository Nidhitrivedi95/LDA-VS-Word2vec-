tXqaK0lBEE1XJbzDPsdFvg Burgers are good, this has been a good place to eat but then I saw a recent review that the milk shakes were being premade. I thought no way I've seen them make them in front of me before but its been a while since I got one. I had lunch there today and sure enough the shakes were dated on the bottom of the cups. Mine was made 8 days ago!! Bad move guys I will no longer be ordering shakes here. Gets me thinking what else is being made this way.
