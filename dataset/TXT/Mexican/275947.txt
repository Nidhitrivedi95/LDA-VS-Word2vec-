xEBor41OFpeeKdcCZ2sfMg Food is OK, nothing special. After all the great reviews maybe I was expecting too much. We waited nearly an hour to be seated, I ordered a shredded beef taco and chicken enchilada. The red chile tasted like it was from a can. The shredded beef was ok. Our service wasn't very good. The waitress kept disappearing and never came back for things we asked for. I might try it again, but definitely won't go out of my way to go back.
