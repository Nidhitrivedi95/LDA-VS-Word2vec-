uLtLJ9sbSYak2WwCb4jjDQ Stopped in on a Sunday night. Place is very clean. The family running shop were very friendly. I got the Bionico which was massive! Lots of everything - fruit variety, coconut, granola, cream and ice cream. It really was a 2 man dish. I could barely eat half, had to save the rest for later. It seemed pricey for $6.50 but is was so huge it could easily more then fill 2 adults. Will be trying other stuff soon. I liked it better then Fruitlandia in Mesa.
