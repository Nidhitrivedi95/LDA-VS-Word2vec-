TZl7YBuzo5awZP8QJDLg_w Many of these reviewers seem to be dining at a restaurant in a different dimension than the Jordans I visit as often as possible. My Jordan's has traditional "Sonoran Red" sauce, one of the few places remaining that serve this sauce rather than some sort of "sausa with pineapple and mangos" [pop lips].  The Jordan's I eat at has solid Mexican food at a reasonable price without the fufu nonsense that many other purported Mexican restaurants engage in to satisfy the ignorant hords that have moved to Arizona from the Midwest, California or the East coast. No tofu tacos, but some of the best cheese enchiladas and shreaded chicken tacos you will find anywhere.
