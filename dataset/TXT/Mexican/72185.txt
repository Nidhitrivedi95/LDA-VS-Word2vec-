C8pZ8cz8QO21E8SjefavQw Best Mexican food I have found in the South Charlotte area. Service was quick and attentive throughout our evening.  My chili relleno and enchilada was wonderful. Others in my party found the soup to be too salty. This would have been a five star rating except for the temperature of the building. Staff apologized, saying while the AC worked, its size was not large enough to cool their restaurant in this hot weather. They had fans throughout, making the temp barely acceptable. Blame the owner of the building, not the restaurant. We'll be back as soon as the weather cools a little bit.
