MlKNIbEM-JL9WesSdwf_Lg I have only ever had the spicy chipotle chicken burritos here, so that's all my review is about.

To be honest, nothing will compare to the burritos I've had when visiting California, but I'll still come back here when I need a burrito.

The spicy chipotle chicken burritos are definitely spicy enough for me, and tasty enough. I've tried to order the tacos, or the "burrito in the buff" I've seen other people order. But when I step up to the counter, it becomes "spicy chipotle chicken burrito, with the green salsa".

Service is efficient.
