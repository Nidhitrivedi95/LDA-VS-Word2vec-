uKsOd2O_VoFvmYop0ryYcQ The food was OK, and the salsas were OK. The chips appear to be store bought. The real reason for the low rating though was it is filthy. I actually was looking for the health dept. rating...which I never found. We got there at 5:30 PM and the food looked like it had been sitting since lunch. Not a sole in the place...empty. Never been here and we had never heard of it, but we won't be back.
