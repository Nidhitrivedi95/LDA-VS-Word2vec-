EP1do6l8hLyIGEru0gN3EQ Always love it here. We tried the Jamaican jerk chicken with the happy beans, veggie, grain and bread/slather. 

The best part? Not only is the food incredibly flavorful, but you feel amazing the next day. Healthy and so delicious. Heads up when you order either of the big chicken plates, they take 40 minutes from when you order. They are so worth it though.

Taco Tuesday -$2 is also a fun time!
