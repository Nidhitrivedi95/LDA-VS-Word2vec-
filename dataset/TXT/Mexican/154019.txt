K-uQkfSUTwu5LIwPB4b_vg Small, overpriced but tasty portions. 

5 stars for taste, ambiance, and one lady was really on top of water refills

- 1 star for price: the popular table side guacamole is $14?! Margaritas are $14-17?! I also saw on the menu a 22 oz ribeye for $85. Not even quality steakhouses charge that much. 

- 1 star for portion size: in regards to the prices above, the guacamole we were served barely went past the rim of the bowl. Not piled up like in the pictures. 3 tacos per order and each taco could be finished in 2 bites. 

-1 star for service: went on a Sunday night at 6:30 pm so understandably a bit busy. Took 5 min to get a refill of tortilla chips. After our main course was finished, waiter came by and recited items off the dessert menu. We asked to see the physical menu to see all the descriptions because we couldn't remember all that. Took 5 min to just give us the menu. 


Overall, great tasting food, but restaurant thinks it is more high-class than it actually is.
