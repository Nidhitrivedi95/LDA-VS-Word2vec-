Ted-cvKJ7pojwy416PVRhw Just got off a 14ish hour shift at the hospital and if I had gotten out any later I would've strongly considered chewing on the surgeons arm--starving! Morenos is right across the street so my husband smartly whisked me away. Maybe my lack of blood sugar will make my review a bit biased, but even though I devoured my chips and Gecko burrito, it could've been much better. The chips and salsas/bean dip were a lifesaver and good flavors all around. The margarita didn't last long either (again, long day)and was tasty. But our food needed some help. Both of our dishes, my hubby's chimi and my burrito were borderline cold. As hungry as I was, I would've eaten it frozen, but really we should've sent them back. The cheese inside wasn't even melted and what wasn't cold was room temp. The carne asada in mine was just little burnt chips of meat, while my husband's shredded beef had no flavor. The salsa did help with the dryness and flavor, but it really could've been better. 

I would like to end on a good note though--the service was so friendly and welcoming. I'm sure any complaints would've been addressed efficiently with apology. Just work on the food a bit and we will be back. At least I'm full
