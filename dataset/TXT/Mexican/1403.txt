-bMZCfTK7fxFaURynKpBMA We loved the colorful decor all around, the walls, the tables, the chairs, the murals! Truly a great feast for the eyes. We had the Molcajete Caliente Estilo Playa Hermosa for two. Four different meats - beef, chicken, fish, shrimp. Small pieces of squid in the molcajete! It was so good and we were stuffed. All for $33. Great value. The service was friendly and attentive. We could banter with the waitress. Desserts looked very good, we had to take the carrot cake home (it had cream cheese filling, studded with pecans and flakes of coconut)!!
