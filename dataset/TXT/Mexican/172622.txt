mCdhEWxl0a4r5OQWgdfF2Q Some Mexican places I love, some are a little lackluster. This place falls under my feelings of "MEH" based off of the fact that nothing really blew my mind. Our server was friendly though! Also we were the last to leave, but didn't feel rushed at all by the workers.  

We started with a lime margarita on the rocks. This was absolutely acceptable, as we got the Tex Mex option which means they used better quality tequila. Then there was the Queso Fundito and chicken quesadilla starter. I was told that the chicken appetizer was "not very good" (I didn't actually eat it since I don't prefer chicken). This is sad to hear since Taco Bell is right down the road... Queso Fundito was okay, but I didn't really like putting it in a tortilla wrapper. Chip worked much better. I just wish it didn't congeal so fast. The enchiladas supreme dish was absolutely flooded in sauce. The flavor was so overpowering that you couldn't really tasty the tortillas and filling below. We did not finish this dish.
