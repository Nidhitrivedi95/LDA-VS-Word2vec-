JcMx_PIy0ROIlJWens4TAQ On our first two visits, it was tolerable,  but not great.  We like the bartender,  and the food was ok.  Looking for something quick and near the house, we stopped in again.  Although there were 5 empty tables within view of the hostess station (Friday night before 8:00), the hostess told us it would be a 10-15 minute wait.  We said the bar was fine, and she said it was full.  We sat down, not minding the short wait, when after 5 minutes, another couple came in and asked about seating at the bar.  The hostess said there were seats available on the outside portion of the bar.  We sighed and figured we would do the same.  Unfortunately, only two seats are set up outside.  We left and had a great meal next door at Amalfi Pizzeria.
