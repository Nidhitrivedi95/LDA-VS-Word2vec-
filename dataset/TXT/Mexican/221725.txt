ROuiI7sWhEMLodSylU2Qpg Well is Tuesday may 5 2015, 9:40 PM I asked for the Sirloin combo, very expensive for 2 tacos that fall apart as soon as you get them out of the aluminum foil wrap, I know the difference between sirloin and carne asada tacos, apparently they don't, well let's make it short, the only good thing here is the salsas but you are paying to much for salsa, this place is getting worse every day,  1 star is my rating I really don't recomend this fast taco place any more, on previous reviews I gave them a 5 star rating, but the tortillas were thick before and the tacos were full of meat and the charro beans were delicious,  now you can find better tacos across the street, Bye Bye taco tote, unless I'm really hungry and you are the only taco place around, then you'll see me again.
