zLwFxVeZeHGyId2tG6lBvg I've been a regular here since Sergio started years ago. Always happy with my food. Even came back after finding a bolt from the frying pan in my burrito.

Today might have been the last time i try to place a order with you guys. If your too busy to take a phone order. Say you are too busy. Hanging up the phone multiple times to get the ringing to go away is very uncool.
