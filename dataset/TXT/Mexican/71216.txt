C2BR0TjNacoNzItPLUHTAA My husband and I  stopped by while visiting Scottsdale, as we are familiar with the Coconut's Fish Cafe in Maui.  So happy we did!  Great place.  Food is fresh and DELICIOUS.  Fairly priced for the generous portion size.  Staff is friendly and Kim, the owner, represents his business very well.  I wish them the best.  We will DEFINITELY be back when we're in the area.
