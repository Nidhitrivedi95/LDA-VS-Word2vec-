UyTYTtyZWym-7u84XMgSOQ Truthfully, I'm hesitant to even write this review because I really want this place to continue to be the best kept secret in Madison.  It's seriously a hidden gem - located in the back of a small Mexican grocery (grab your soda from the cooler on the way in), it opens into a large dining room that you couldn't predict being back there!  Food is awesome - my go to is the chicken enchiladas.  Sounds ordinary but it's not - the shredded chicken has a certain something - flavorful, juicy and covered in your choice of delicious red or green sauce (I always go green).  The plate comes with rice and beans - the rice is good but the white beans are a unique twist on your traditional mushy brown kind.  My husband always gets 6 tacos (street style) - the campechano (steak & chorizo) are his fave.  The tortas are huge and delicious.  The real star of the menu is the quesadilla.  Not the sad, flat grilled cheese kind - an oversized, crispy, stuffed (with your choice of meat & cheese) boat-shaped deliciousness that is super tasty.  

Service can sometimes be slow but who cares, stop rushing things and enjoy the experience.  And don't tell anyone else about this place!  It's our secret :)
