iikAHVLZrZn7Zy1aEPD25A I went there tonight! Forget about it! I won't be eating chipotle anymore!!!!!!!! My food was suppose to be done at 630. Showed up at 635 figured to give them a little extra time and they told me they didn't have time to make it!!! I said that ok. Then they said sir we are extremely busy so You are going to have to wait. I said that fine. Paid!!!!! Five minutes later I came up and they said we are making it now. I said "Ok that perfect thank you!" I'm the nicest guy in the world so I didn't say anything. At 650 they said ok Scott your food is ready! I wanted to tell them I order online because I didn't want to want in line! Everyone in line got there food way before me! I should of waited in line would of been way faster!
