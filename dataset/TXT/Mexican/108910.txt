a) shark taco was really good. love the cilantro salsa in it. 
b) mole poblano with chicken burro was flavorful. and the way to make a burro is by shredding the meat. it was great! 
c) the oversized horchata was unique. expect it to be more like a dessert rather than a drink. it's large, so consider sharing it amongst your party.
d) the best salsa bar i've been too. love the cilantro salsa and pecan salsa.
