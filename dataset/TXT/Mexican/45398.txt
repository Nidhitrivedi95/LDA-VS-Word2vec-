7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA I love the roasted vegetable Benny served on a toasted english muffin with sharp white cheddar, alongside a mixed green salad with a delicious miso dressing. Potato hash browns are usually undercooked but everything is so good that this can be overlooked. Ginger tea should not be missed on cold winters days.
