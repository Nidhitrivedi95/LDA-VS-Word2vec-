gOpOoZgrF2shRLCBBzO3Mw Well, not bad really. Healthy sized burrito. I had the carne asada. Meat wasn't the best, a tiny on the chewy side but not bad. Good meal really, you won't be hungry after one of these.   They were not too busy but I still waited what felt like a longer than normal time to get my order, maybe 8  to 10 minutes. Staff taking the order was efficient but a little abrupt. I don't mind that much really, a place like this is about the food not the social skills of the staff.   All in all I'd say this place is worth an occasional visit. Very casual. It really is a shack.
