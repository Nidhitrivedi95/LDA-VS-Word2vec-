cChJhpiljARaINk-dyXGiQ Sorry, but I was not impressed at all. The place has a very authentic atmosphere, but the food .. Not so much. After living in Arizona I know what good authentic Mexican food is, and this place missed it. I hope it was just a one-time bad experience. However, I won't be back to find out.
