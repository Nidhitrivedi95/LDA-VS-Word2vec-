OjnRf8yDGEBCoUDdchSViw Cajun and Mexican fusion?!  I got a Blackened Catfish bowl.  There really wasn't anything "Mexican" about that bowl, except that they added some shredded lettuce and a dollop of sour cream to the top.  Nonetheless, I still enjoyed it.  The bowl came with a generous helping of catfish, beans, and cajun rice with andouille sausage.

The fish was truly blackened and had a little bit of a kick to it.  It was enjoyable and the fish was nicely cooked although some of the outer edges of the filet were a little dry.

I liked this a lot, but next time I'd ask for no sour cream.

p.s. my friend ordered the hush puppies, I would say skip those.
