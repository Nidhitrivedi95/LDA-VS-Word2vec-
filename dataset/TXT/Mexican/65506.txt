bAdwf-n52f46-ZjlfJ1Hwg For a chain Mexican restaurant known for being a hole in the wall standard, this place elevates the usual robertos dining experience. Yes it's in a gas station but it's huge! 8 tables with 5 of those tables seating 6 people is larger than any previous robertos that I've been to. I like to come on Wednesdays for 99 cent chicken tacos. The dining room is clean and the service has always been friendly. The food has always been exactly as I ordered and expected it to be.
