qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A Let me get this off my chest..  THIS PLACE WAS PHENOMENAL!  

Ok, I feel better now.  Lets get into some detail....  The wait staff was amazing.  I am bad with names so i cant give specific credit, but ill cover that by saying every single staff person interacted with us.  we went on a thursday afternoon.  was nice and quiet.  I had the Green Chile burger which was ENORMOUS and quite tasty.  A grilled buttered bun always wins me over.  I regret to say it was so big I couldnt finish it.  The pomegranate Iced Tea was great too.  and they kept refilling it!  My friend had the vegetable curry with cous cous.  Now while none of that sounded appetizing to me, I tried it and WOW...  The vegetables were cooked perfectly and the curry was amazing.  

Ill end with saying the carrot cake was SOOOOO good.  we left very stuffed and smiling.  

Loved the wait staff!!
