YSYDJTCt5kzY2kKnLNGRiA Weird how food so bland must have been salty as I've been downing water as though I have been lost out in the Sahara desert for the last hour since we arrived home. I had their short rib with tortillas and baby serving of onions, cheese accompaniments. The salsa was bland and boring, not the slightest bit sweet or seasoned. Chips were not flavorful either. The queso dip ended up a hard, dried cheese ala mozzarella sticks after 15 minutes. The corn tortillas were dry and unflavored. My daughter's carnitas tacos tasted gamey. I am not sure what type of Mexican restaurant this is supposed to be but our money would have been better spent and tastebuds better satisfied at Blue Agave or Rubios.
