Secondly, the prices are pretty low for Las Vegas.

Thirdly, the pinto bean sopes are some of the BEST I've ever had. I love sopes. Love them. The texture of the Pinches sopes was perfect, not soggy and not rock hard like at many places (even in Mexico). I took one bite of my boyfriend's and had to go back in and order a whole one just for myself.

The nopal taco is pretty good too, but five stars for the sopes! When they're so good, why would you even want to order anything else?
