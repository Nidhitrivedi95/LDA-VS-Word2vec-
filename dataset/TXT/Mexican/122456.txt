hfuuuwuwqe30kbZCZH2s7w Took 20 mins to get our food and it was cold. Had to send it back and it seems like there is only one cook. I am sure I'm going to  wait another 20 mins to get my food. We told the girl no beans bc my BF is allergic to it and still beans on the plate. I won't be coming here again.
