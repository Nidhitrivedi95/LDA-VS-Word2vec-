DYGCzsHi7pT4AAe8kh5Dug I ordered a chicken burritos.

I think my biggest complaint was that the burritos was not as hot as I like it to be. I liked the chipotle tabasco on the table. It added nice smoked flavour to my burritos.

Not thrilled that guacamole is an extra $3! Very steep in my opinion. Also the price was higher than other burritos spots.

I think I like Quesada down the street a tad more.
