pJdPcHkqtaLF47pS0LxdYQ We found this restaurant by accident.  My wife and I were looking for a change of pace and decided to check it out as we normally eat at other restaurants in the neighborhood.  The first time we dined here we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food.  It very good and inexpensive.  I agree service from the servers can be a little slow but considering the friendliness of the staff it is easy for me to overlook this short-coming.  

Not only is the food good, you get generous serving of what ever you order.  Since or first visit we have been back a number of times bring a number of friends and they have all expressed the same sentiment that this is a great place to eat, relax and enjoy.
