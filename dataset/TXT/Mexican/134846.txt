IkMwuS3eViVHK09npuG1jQ If allowed I would give negative stars. This place needs to close to protect El Pollo Loco's reputation. Dry chicken and old and you can barely swallow it. Needs to be improved or needs to close.  

Went thru drive thru and got the worst meal alive. Dry Spanish rice and the tortillas aren't fresh. Will not go to this location ever again.
