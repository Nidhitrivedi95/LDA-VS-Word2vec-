xzGe1EkD9FJH0dN7QnyqBQ Ate here recently on my quest to find authentic Mexican in Summit Co, per my hair stylist who is California raised. 

Asked the server about the mole, she said she makes better mole at home (I appreciate her honesty), so I passed on that one and just got a combo platter.  My family order a special and a menu item.

Not bad, not a ton of flavor though.  Didn't have a stomach ache all night or any other issues.  I guess this is my new Mexican place for the time being.

Atmosphere is noisy.  Got to hear the torid details of the girl across the aisle's love life while we were eating.  I might try take out next time.
