zdE82PiD6wquvjYLyhOJNA This review is for yelper Nelson's UYE!  When I walked into the restaurant I was greeted by Nelson and other cool Yelpers.  On the table were chips/guac and egg rolls with sweet/sour sauce.  They were good, I especially enjoyed the egg/spring rolls.

For the entree I ordered a fusion chicken taco and fusion beef burrito.  What can you say, it's what I came here for.  Fusion styles it was!  My taco was piled with chicken on top of chicken and my burrito stuffed with beef!  With a splash of lime and added chile/fusion and kim chee... oooo yyyuuummmmyyyy.

Nuts gathered here!

After our entrees we were given oranges and fortune cookies!  Nice little place, great find Nelson!  Thx!
