eJPckkV1k7gn0V2awA1pzA First sushi burrito I ate was from here. Was heading home to Cali where no places like these exist, only poke joints. I was deciding between the Triple S and Caterpillar so the guy suggested the first one only if I was really hungry, which I wasn't. Caterpillar it was and I really enjoyed it. Subbed cream cheese with seaweed salad. Wasn't too big but it packed good flavors with the eel and chipotle sauces. I saw everyone posting on the Triple S so sometimes it's good to try something different from everyone else. I'd come back to try another in the future.
