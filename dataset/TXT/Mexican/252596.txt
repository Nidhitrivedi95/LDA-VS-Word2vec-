UtllsEfocRVLB36mR2pTzg My wife an I visited this cantina this past weekend and we really enjoyed ourselves. The food was really good meat quesadilla and carne asada tacos super good they're red beef is really good as well. My wife really enjoyed the margaritas the beer was cold but kinda pricey.

All in all  a great place to hang out  however the Prices are on the higher side.
