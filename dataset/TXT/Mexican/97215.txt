EJmiKQKlWfY-0iVlya7FOQ Sadly, I do not know of good places to get burritos when I'm in the GTA so I rely on z-teca to get my fix. I've been here many times and i find you are very limited in what you want to put in your burrito. Like for veggies you can only choose one item out of the three offered (corn, beans, or bell peppers). I guess the good thing is that there are many promotions (all burritos on cinco de mayo were $5)

Overall, it's nothing really special.... can someone please open a yummy burrito joint uptown? lol please and thanks
