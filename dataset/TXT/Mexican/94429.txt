E6DmUAHfSRCEakvknot-zA This place is AMAZING!! me and my boyfriend went on a vacation to Las vegas (we are from Cali) and after a crazy weekend came a hangover and what better way to cure that hangover than with mariscos and a michelada. we went on a sunday it was a bit crowded the wait was about 15minutes (but worth it) service was awesome &the food my goodness i wanna say a bit better tasting than the places I have  been to here in Cali the shrimp was bigh lol. we 1st tryed the oysters preparados, we also had camarones envenedados, and camarones en mantequilla both plates were DELISHIS!! this place is located about 20mins from the vegas strip and a must try.
