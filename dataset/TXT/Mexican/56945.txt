A4yJu-Nq1n6nuLP6QKZkrw I always had written this place off as another fast food place but the food is incredible. Food quality is way ABOVE title of "fast food"!!! I could literally eat the classic chicken salad everyday and in the last month, pretty much have!!! If you haven't tried them in forever, you need to go back, quality for price is completely ABOVE "average".
