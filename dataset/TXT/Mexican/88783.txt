Best I've ever had from a restaurant. They make the best flour tortillas in front of big windows. Ordered two just to dip in hot sauce, it was awesome! Tacos get a 9 out of 10. Recommend! Beans and rice are good, but could be served hotter. Food comes in a Styrofoam box but is great. Place is very clean. My wife and I highly recommend. They're closed Sunday, but I respect workers getting a weekend day off.
