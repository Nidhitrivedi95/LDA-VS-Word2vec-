SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA Great food at very good prices here. For $26.95, we get the flamin' fajitas for two, I get shrimp, he gets steak. The food comes out quickly and the portions are huge. The best part is after you get served your chips and salsa, you get a cup of yummy fideo soup which is a great complimentary starter to your meal. There are big screen TVs there so you can watch the game while you eat, there is a separate bar area and a dance floor. The wait staff try very hard to be attentive. It can be hit or miss depending on who you get and how busy it is, but if you are not quite happy or if there is a something amiss they do not hesitate to try to fix it. Luckily, there were no big issues, just a misunderstanding with our fajitas for two. I wanted the shrimp cooked separately and not mixed in with the steak fajitas. They offered to remake the meal, but we declined and ate it anyway and it was delicious. Try this place, it a new business that is working very hard to make a great impression on every single customer.
