scnWmw-edweZpj-N3kk9gQ We were here for Cinco de Mayo, and arrived around 8:20pm. The wait was about 25 minutes and then once we were seated, it took another 20 minutes to get drinks and chips delivered. Entrees arrived 50 minutes after we ordered. Food was ok - nothing special. Clearly they were overwhelmed and probably short handed. We'll probably find another option next time we want Mexican food.
