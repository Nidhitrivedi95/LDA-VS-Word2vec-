vjhB95c5nOXflNoyq_jKzw Have eaten here two times now and thought both times my food was disgusting. First time I got a chicken bowl and I remember thinking there was no flavor and it was just not good. Last night I got the mexi Cobb salad thinking this has to be good it's a dang salad! The dressing killed it. It was so awful. Of the whole party I went with maybe one person semi enjoyed their meal and one person even said " I recall thinking their food was better" 2 stars for the margaritas. Those were awesome but I wouldn't drive somewhere just for a single margarita and no dinner! The waitress was also great. too bad the food is not up to par!
