AhPmh0NaRDbEYyhd9egzLA There was no Joy in Joy Ride unless you want to donate your money to them for bad food and expensive prices. It's very trendy and that's about it! We are regulars at Postinos and used to go to the Windsor on Central regularly. We were regulars for quality food and great service at those two places .  However I can't express the disappointment on Fathers day at Joyride. The the burritos and taco was cold and stuffed with rice rather than chicken or machaca. We were asked if we wanted red or green sauce unwillingly knowing that it cost $2 extra and it's not flavorable. We tried Barrio Cafe and was so good went 2 days in a row, or Los Dos Molinos both of them were flavorful and affordable authentic Mexican food. We will never return to Joyride!!
