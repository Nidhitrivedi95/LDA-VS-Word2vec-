Came for a breakfast burrito and it was delicious! I got the Breakfast Supreme Burrito (bacon, ham, potato, egg & cheese) and I was surprised how good it was. The potatoes are the little seasoned potato cubes and everything was fresh and not overly greasy. They are basically full strips of bacon and not bits. The green salsa is a favorite there but the red is good too. There's plenty of flavor in the burrito itself so I could be fine going for no salsa even. 
Also a great price point. I ordered 3 of the same burrito (not all for me) and with tax it was $16. 
The staff is helpful and friendly. 
Limited on hours open, I think it was 8am-3pm. I want to even say closed on Sundays. 
Definitely recommend trying it out!
