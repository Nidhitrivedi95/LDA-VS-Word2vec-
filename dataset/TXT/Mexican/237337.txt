SWDxTrwU_qlEcJp36IYquw Tried this place for the first time today-we waited too long! First-it smelled heavenly when we walked in. The dining area is really cute and we were immediately greeted. Ordered two sandwiches and a piece of cheesecake to go. Needless to say that everything was really good-really good flavor. we will certainly be back and would like to dine in next time.
