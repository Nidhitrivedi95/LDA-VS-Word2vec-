as_fyujgsdwtV56n31z-Sw i had an amazing time here, and i'd like to give kudos to our server, curt, for being very helpful and making us feel at home.

we had some mojitos & queso dip (which was excellent)...for the tacos, we decided on the traditional chicken taco, the spicy chicken (which was great) and the crab (which was new, sneaky hot, but fairly average in my book).

hard to really find anything wrong...i'll definitely be back soon for more!
