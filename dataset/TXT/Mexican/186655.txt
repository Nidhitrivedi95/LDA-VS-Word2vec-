Nz44ccUso3nq5S2OlQHNlA Great food, unparalleled service, kind & jovial owner!

We drove all the way from Milton to Scarborough since I heard nothing but good word of mouth. And it was so worth it.

Complimentary nachos, cheesy spicy nachos, Spicy shrimp in red sauce, tachos and Chicken Enchiladas. Perrrrfect!

They have homemade spicy red and green sauce. Green sauce is made of Jalapeños. I went so gaga about it that Lucia (owner) packed us some to take home. Whaaaaat!!!

She and her brothers feed hungry amigos all over GTA. I just hope the brothers are as kind, attentive and nice to their customers as Lucia was. 

Amazing experience!
