oCwJdiYhZS8VM5_LgmQP0g Really enjoy the food, but the customer service for non-European Americans sucks. Tried to seat us as far away from the front as possible when the restaurant was almost empty. Did not even know there was a room that far in back of the dining area. Ordered a side item that never came which we were charged for. When we asked for the server to have the item removed from the bill the phoney acting hostess showed up saying our server was busy, even though we could see she was not.  As we finished our lunch the side showed up. We refused it and the server pointed to our almost empty plate to say some of the item was in the sauce.  May take a chance and return, but get the food to go and the hostess better not touch the order. Tried the location in Chandler and this server did not write anything down,  brought the wrong food, would  not remove the empty plates and was rude.
