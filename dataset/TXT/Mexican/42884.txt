7bATb_KMu18aEDcVIowB5g Taco King is surprisingly good for a Chinese owned and operated, Danforth Ave., halal Mexican joint. They do delivery, take-out, or you can sit at one of the 4-5 tables. Just don't pronounce things with a proper Mexican accent or the Chinese staff will have no idea what you're talking about.

There are a wide variety of options here: hard or soft tacos, quesadillas, tostadas, fajitas, burritos, and enchiladas. I went for an Al Carbon (grilled steak) and Guacamole ($2.49) tortilla. The steak was surprisingly good; big juicy chunks of well seasoned meat. The guac was decent as well and plentiful. This came on a nice freshly made 8-inch flour tortilla. If you're looking for a full meal you'll probably want 2-3 of these as they're not that big.

The tacos are hard shell style and not nearly as good as the tortillas.

An interesting place worth checking out both for the mixing of cultures and the decent Mexican eats.
