a8pmtlVKf7NiSLI-4KejIw In love with this place! Really great place for drinks on the patio and food to share on a nice summer day. 

The patio is really nice as is the indoor part of the restaurant and they play great music! Situated in the distillery district, a nice walk following dinner is in line. The menu is set up as dishes to share between friends, so you get to try a bit of multiple dishes. 

The service is great. If you don't know what to get, just ask your server and they usually have a ton to say. 

Its a little pricy but if you split a few dishes with people, its not too bad. 

Verdict: Great place for summer hang outs and drinks with the girls!
