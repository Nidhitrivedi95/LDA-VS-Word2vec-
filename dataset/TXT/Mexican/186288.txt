Ny9cKPLAHjwUEoGjSCWzEw Came here on a Monday around 5:30...good thing, as by the time we left, the line was out of the restaurant (approx. 30 people).

Very similar to a Chipotle, although there are some differences on the menu (that I prefer, actually).  Ingredients were pretty fresh, although I would've liked a little bit more meat (pork) in my burrito.  I had the home wrecker, and it was pretty good.  Appreciated the choice of five salsas to enjoy with my chips, and their hot sauce for the burrito was killer.

Wife and kids seemed pleased with their choices, too.  I imagine we'll be back.
