hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg have to say we were not looking at this spot to eat while on a short 4 day Montreal vacation. as it turned out it was a 3 minute walk from our condo. Walked in and had a reservation for the same night.
 Lets just say that we were dissapointed. Mostly with the service. I had oysters ( very good) cod fitters with creme freshe and cavier( so so) and the short ribs ( excellent) My partner had Steak frites. She ordered med rare and it came blue and was not a good cut at all. The reason for the 3 * is we felt that from the moment we sat down we were getting pushed out. Our waitress was like a waterbug. Never having time for any freindly chatter ( which we enjoy) There were plenty of servers so this shouldnt have been a problem. All in all not a "fun" or "gastro" experience.
