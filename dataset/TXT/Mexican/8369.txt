_QvGAqMmrUIlxpby2Ul5Dg Initially I was surprised that Dona Maria's didn't receive rave reviews. My family has been coming here for years. Dona Maria's is our go-to for family functions, actually. We have had many graduation, birthday, and even going away dinners here. However, after a recent experience my mom and I had, I'm not shocked that they don't have the best rating. 
The restaurant was empty (as usual; I don't think I've ever seen them busy) and we were seated quickly. Francisco was our server and he came to our table exactly twice; to take our order and to bring us our food. He has a bad attitude and acts like you are really putting him out if you ask for anything. Our drinks were empty the majority of the time, and my Mom had to wave him down to ask for our check and to-go order despite the fact that we were clearly done with the meal and had been for a while. So why four stars despite the service? Because when we went to pay, we were given 20% off to rectify the situation. We were also advised to ask not to be seated in his section again. It's pretty bad when a member of your own staff won't recommend you. The food is good, but make sure you ask to be seated in Eloy's section. He's the best and always remembers our family and even our usual orders. I no longer have to ask for a side of sour cream because Eloy knows.
