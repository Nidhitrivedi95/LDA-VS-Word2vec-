eJPckkV1k7gn0V2awA1pzA I've had the opportunity to visit this location about 10 times at least in the past 8 months. 
* Food is excellent 
* Service gets 5 stars as well, they are always happy to help and patient when a customer is deciding on what to get. 
* My go-to favorite at this point is the Sunny Salmon. Remove the pico de gallo and swap the sauce for their chipotle sauce and you're in for a treat. 

* If you work in the area, they give you a 10% discount. 

Thank you Soho!
