Or7FgbgY8ML30zgYj_DCwA I've been here 3 times.  First impression was quite good!  Second visit we got fish tacos, my friends were raw and mine made me vomit.   It's been several months since I've been back but I decided to give it another shot since I love Mexican food.  I walked into the restaurant which wasn't very busy and sat down at the bar.  The staff noticed me sit down but were all standing around chatting to each other and seemed generally uninterested that I was there.  After 10 minutes I simply walked out.

I won't be back. 

Bradford has an excellent mexican restaurant and great service.  Go there instead.
