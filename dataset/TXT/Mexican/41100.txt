sort of ranch dip (which was delicious). We ordered a couple bottles of beer (they were on special that day for 2$). The waiter was prompt, we placed out food orders and it came out quickly. The food was good, not the best but not the worst.

Overall, my experience was that it was no different than any other Mexican restaurant, the food wasn't any better (or worse) than other places, the service was quick, and drinks average.
