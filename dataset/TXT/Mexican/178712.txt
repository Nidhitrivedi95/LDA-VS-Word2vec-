MyTsAeShB9pcWP84GSTAdw Easy to get to location, great tasting food and very friendly service.   I ordered the Bulgagi plate with rice and Korean wings.   Definitely a great place to go.   Saw the Fusion Burrito delivered to a table and WOW, great.  They also have a Happy Hour from 3 - 6 pm for beer/wine.  Will have to check that out!!
