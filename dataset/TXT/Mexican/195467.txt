ovApUucCKSb9k0lTP2JieQ Been here a few times now and it's slowly becoming top 3 favorite Mexican spots. 4 different salsas come to your table when you first get there, all 4 are great my personal favorite is the green (jalapeño). The tacos are phenomenal, traditional Mexican tacos simply made in a soft tortilla with choice of meat, onions and cilantro. Chimichangas are definitely worth a try as well! Quaint place inside, friendly staff!
