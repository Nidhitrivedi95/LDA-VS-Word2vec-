fXqlzAM6PTXUGrU4y33LzQ NO! Just NO!! 4 stars??? Really?!?! I went here with my family based on Yelp reviews. We were excited for the possibility of having a good Mexican food spot fairly close to home. We were extremely disappointed. We were given a small serving of chips and salsa for a family of five, had to ask for a refill, food took forever to be served once ordered (the restaurant was empty), food was barely warm, flavor was bland, the picture in the menu showed that my dish came with sour cream...it didn't and then was told that I would have to pay extra if I wanted it, soda was served in a small glass and kept having to flag the waitress down to ask for refills instead of being checked on and offered a refill. The decor was colorful and fun, but the food and service were blah at best!
