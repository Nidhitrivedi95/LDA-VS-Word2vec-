gtffarZ2Y_rLfCegMg-nqw The people here were super friendly and helpful. When my burrito fell apart because it was overstuffed they gave me a bowl and a togo lid. (So thoughtful) the only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because when my mom went to get her coke, it was really watered down. So the soda machine must've been out of syrup.
