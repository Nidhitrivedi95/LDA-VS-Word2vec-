sHsjBV5_kuuC2aU2PuSlUg This place is borderline addictive. I HAD to give it a try once I found out it was from the same Chef/owner of Soho (Which is an amazing off the strip japanese place). 
     I have not been disappointed with a burrito yet, but I do have some favorites, The Rockport and the Redondo. 
     Brought some co-workers here and they all loved it. Brought my girlfriend, she's got a jaburrito problem now.  lol
     I have tried with the seaweed paper, soy paper and flour tortilla. I think they are all good in their own way. (The seaweed tends to get a bit messy near the end), 
Best thing about Jaburrito is that I always feel pleasantly satisfied without and heavy lunch feeling after.  Light and fresh.

    They definitely need a bigger seating area and more locations around Vegas.   Hope they expand!

Lastly,  To the Review by Robert S.   Why would you rate a place one star because they aren't open on a certain day? How's life at the center of the universe?  You, sir, are one of the very bad things about Yelp. 
    And, by the way, it's Sundays, not Sunday's.
