6nnI3DfHn-DTd6tWnZu7Jg Almost 10 minutes waiting in the drive-thru to get to the box to place my order, another 7 minutes to actually place my order, another 4-5 to get to the window & then get to the window to find that I couldn't use my chosen method of payment..About 20 minutes of my life wasted & no dinner to show for it. I don't know what's happened to this location but it's really gone downhill.
