sueADCkf8a4m3Exnd-4qeQ Qdoba has edible Mexican food (that's not saying much since I LOVE vegetables and it makes up for the taste) but they were not very clean and the service was average. Average as in wow doesn't anyone ever smile anymore? The quality of their ingredients is so-so. Nothing about this joint was worth remembering. Stingy meat portions, too.
