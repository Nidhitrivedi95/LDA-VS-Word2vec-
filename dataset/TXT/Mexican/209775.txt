the parking lot is a little tough to navigate when they are busy but we'll worth the hassle. I always feel like I hit the lotto when there is no line to order but never takes more than 5 min and the food comes out quickly. 

If I had to pick a negative it's that the horchata always tastes a little watered down but that never stops me.
