wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ Thats sad. This place used to be so good.Gave it another try and just not worth it. I used to pay $20 for 2 people .. Now its $35.. Its not even as good as it used to be.. I see the grocery store has now closed too.. I think its just a matter of time till they close the restaurant. This is an example of "If it aint broke, dont fix it." 
I am not sure what happened here, but this place is a train wreck waiting to happen. I have spent my last dollar here. 

BoOooOooooo HIsssssSsssss!
