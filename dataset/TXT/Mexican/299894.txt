zLwFxVeZeHGyId2tG6lBvg Have ordered from here numerous times for delivery without an issue. Called today first 3 times and no one answered. Then finally got through and they put me on hold for 8 mins!!!!! I hung up to call back and it went straight to their vm. Do you seriously have only 1 line?! When I finally got through and told them I've been on hold. Their response was "yeah you were on hold because we are busy" uh no shit, there's still a level of customer service to be expected. Done ordering from here!
