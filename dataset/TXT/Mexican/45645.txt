7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA Visited for lunch with coworkers last week and enjoyed my meal/experience.

There was a surprisingly long line mid day so we waited about 15 minutes for a table. Not a big deal but worth noting that when you visit, plan for some possible wait time.

I ordered a housemade unsweetened iced tea and the spicy salmon sandwich was with side salad. Food was tasty, nicely prepared and fresh. Our server was polite and prompt. For those interested, there are many vegan/veggie friendly choices on the menu.

Would like to come back for brunch soon!
