N-EA6G39XHc1RqF-4jAABg Stumbled onto this place after driving around in the rain in the North York area looking for somewhere to eat. Took a quick skim on Yelp before deciding to go in. Better than expected. I've learned to always go in expecting the worst especially with Mexican food! Decor is standard and clean. Hostess/waitress was not wearing too skimpy an outfit but I guess others would disagree. Hot pants and a tank top? Plus she was on the bit chubbier side so maybe not the best choice for this family-oriented area. 

No complimentary nachos and salsa like others have mentioned. Perhaps it was because we ordered the 9 - layer bean dip that the menu said it is a Fiesta in our mouths.  Sorry not really a Fiesta but it was fine. We asked for hot sauce and sour cream. Without eh, with better. Nachos weren't too stale. 

I ordered the ground beef, chicken and chorizo chimichanga and my companion ordered the shrimp, short ribs and fish enchiladas. Both not bad. The guacamole that came with the chimichanga was quite fresh and tasty but needed a pinch of salt. Otherwise the chimichanga was stuffed and the meats inside were cooked well. A bit too much beans as I could barely finish 1/3rd of it. The enchiladas were good. He ordered the green tomatillo sauce which I have to admit was well balanced and not overly tart. The deep fried fish was well cooked, shrimp was a bit rubbery while the ribs were dry.  However with the overall flavours,  not bad. I'd come back to try the other stuff on the menu! The sides we had were the refried beans, salad and rice. All not good but what do you really expect from the sides? 

Service was good. We left stuffed but satisfied. A good go-to option for Mexican if you are in this area. There really is nothing else. And to respond to a fellow Yelper,  this is loads better than a Taco Bell.
