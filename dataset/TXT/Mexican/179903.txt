Need to re-fuel on the fly? Come here.  You can sit down in a clean environment and feel full for not too much cash.

I can't really say I would order the same thing again. The taquito i had was a soft shell but it literally crumbled from the filling it had sitting on it. So much so that the first time i picked it up the soft shell tore apart and i had to use a fork.  Fork with this food is so wrong.

For the price, I would return but with a giant lesson learned.
