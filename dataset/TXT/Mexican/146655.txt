jlF81N1Hr9tANTfMSRWsLA They just opened this location and I was so excited because it is close to one of my clients. To begin with, this location is smaller than your typical Chipotle. Anyways I was so excited and ready to get my bowl on when to my disappointment they ran out of brown rice, WHAT!? How can Chipotle run out of one of their main ingredients?! Well talk about making a bad first impression, however I must note that all the employees were pretty friendly.

I will probably visit this Chipotle once again, hopefully this time they have brown rice.
