qnn9E-e9orYf_wK37yLTYw Let me begin by saying that we are generally HUGE Fox Concepts fans and the Blancos in Scottsdale is one of our favorite restaurants.  We were hopeful that the Blancos at the Biltmore would be equally good. Unfortunately, we have been very disappointed, especially with the service and the service was so bad tonight, we just left.  My wife, my daughter and I sat for 10 minutes without any server approaching our table.  Then, even after I asked the hostess for a server, several servers walked right past our table without offering us any waters, chips, NOTHING.  We have never been so ignored as customers as we were tonight.  After being completely ignored for 15 minutes, we left and went to the Cheesecake Factory.  I don't know if there was a manager on duty but whomever it was needs to have a long talk with his staff on how not to treat customers.  A bad reputation can spread very quickly.....
