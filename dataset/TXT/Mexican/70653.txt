c_XbaJqhm-5ycSBOkVUBmg I stopped by Don Taco the other day for a snack. I won't lie, the 3 tacos for $5 sign out front was what drew me in. For the price, the tacos were good. I mean really, you can't even get 3 tacos at Taco Bell for $5 and these are better than Taco Bell.

So the restaurant is at the back of a bakery/café called Café Desserts Etc. The decor looks like a bakery and not so much a taco joint, but hey whatever.

It's the same staff working both places and the menus are combined into one.

So the 3 for $5 tacos were the Picadillo tacos the day I went (the cashier had to ask the chef what the special taco was, so not sure if it changes daily, or she was new and didn't know). The tacos were on a corn tortilla (I love corn tortillas! Many Mexican fast food places use flour tortillas, boo!). They were filled with ground beef, potatoes, lettuce and sour cream. There were 3 different hot sauces that you could add to your tacos. I tried all of them and liked the green one the most. 

The beef itself was minimal and yes, somewhat reminiscent of Taco Bell, but the taco was tastier and much more interesting than a Taco Bell taco. The potatoes added an interesting texture and taste, and the sauce they were cooked in was flavourful.

Listen, you're not going to get gourmet tacos for the price. I went in expecting fast food tacos and with such expectations, I was pleased with what I got. 

Staff were pleasant and the place was clean.

I would go back.
