O_UC_izJXcAmkm6HlEyGSA Toronto finally has an excellent, almost authentic Mexican restaurant.  Somewhat small and cramped inside, the food makes up for this by miles.  There's also a patio out front (closed on a Wed afternoon and a rear patio) The margaritas, huevos rancheros, enchiladas, chilles rellenos and flautas were all A+.  Service although efficient was just average. Get these servers some personality.  Food came quickly, portions were a good size and nicely presented.  
I would definitely recommend this restaurant and will return when back in Toronto.
