HOlDxrYqfoJrVq2Eo-_LKQ The service was really nice at this location. The inside was not very clean and there was not a whole lot of people inside eating. The food to a longggg time to get and really it was not thst great. This is the second time I have been in a farmer boys thst I have had something negative to say and I think that tells me to not go back and eat their food.
