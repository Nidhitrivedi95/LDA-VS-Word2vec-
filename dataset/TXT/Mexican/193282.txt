OOHlm2lbVgPHhSe98YW3yA One of our favorite restaurants in the district! Offers a great variety of good! Kids love the bean burrito and quesadillas! I love the black bean salad and the anthem burrito! Outdoor seating by the splash pad is fun for kiddos so parents can enjoy their meal and a beer if they so choose ;-)
