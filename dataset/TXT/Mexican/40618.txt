The guys over the counter and kitchen are nice and friendly. 
The order is cooked fresh in front of your eyes. 
The food is good, and the price is reasonable, in sync with most of the other Mexican food joints. If you want a good quick bite with fresh ingredients, but nothing fancy... it's a good place to head for.
