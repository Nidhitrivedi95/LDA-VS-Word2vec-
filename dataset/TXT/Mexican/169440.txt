lWmDrnqgU6w3gFaJyn_1Uw Had brunch here and was recommended lobster eggs benedict. Their Hollander sauce was pretty good but the dish wasn't anything exceptional and the portion was really small. For a $13 brunch dish, I would expect more portion and a better taste. I also tried their caprese omelet and it was too garlicky. I wouldn't go there for their brunch.
