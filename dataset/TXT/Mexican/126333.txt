HUKbH7r9TBJPri6LJbBKtw I have eaten here before and normally it's fine. Today I ordered a Lengua Burrito and added cheese for almost a dollar. They forgot to add the cheese but the worst part is they didn't even shred or cut the lengua. I had huge CHUNKS of lengua in my burrito. I've never had anything lengua that wasn't properly chopped. Sorta disgusted by the way it looked and tasted mediocre. Lost a customer
