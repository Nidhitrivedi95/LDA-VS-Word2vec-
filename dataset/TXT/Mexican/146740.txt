But it's consistent--that's the key. I've gotten to the point now, when I walk in, if the right cashier is there--all I have to do is hand her my card for my to-go order on the way into work. 5 mins. later I'm out the door, burrito in hand. She's plenty friendly, so not sure what all the other folks are talking about. Also, it's a small Mexican food restaurant, if you're expecting full silverware and plates, please go elsewhere. Oh, and the red salsa is fantastic!

These guys are #2 on my list for breakfast burritos here in the East Valley. Love em'!
