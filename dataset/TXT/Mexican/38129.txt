64dfRmMmUsOdLnkBOtzp4w You have to try the guacamole here. It's THAT good. I love the citrus that they add to it.

The tacos are meh. The burger is surprisingly the star of the show at this Mexican restaurant. I would have given this place 4 stars, but the mediocre tacos and burritos bring it down.

Guac and burger, that's what this place is good for. Otherwise, save your money and head elsewhere because the prices are a little obscene for this type of fanfare.
