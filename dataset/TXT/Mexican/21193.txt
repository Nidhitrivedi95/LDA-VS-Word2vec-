2g4ZTD3ePNSbDAvh6qAOKQ Had the King Carlos, or more like had 3/4 of half of it (see picture). It was filled with about 206 kinds of protein along with a thin slice of avocado, tomato and lettuce to help balance it out... Sort of. The torta bread is really good but the flavor of sandwich itself is really muddled with so many meats. Still pretty good though.
