u1m3qTIrhZhwNjMT6n-M8g Just stopped in for a free cheese crisp, offered through Yelp, but decided to try a margarita and the menudo. Not sorry about either. The food is good. They charged me for the 'free' cheese crisp, but corrected it after I pointed it out. Will come back again, if nothing else, for the really good margaritas. I recommend, but check your bill....
