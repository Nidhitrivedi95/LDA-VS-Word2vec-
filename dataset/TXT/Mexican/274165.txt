X57f6FWZiwI1wOidPPhOrQ Well, I was underwhelmed.

I went in to this place, expecting good, authentic Mexican food.  What I got was authentic.

Starters: Chips and salsa - two types of salsa, no explanation.  It's not like we can't figure out one is hot and one isn't, but the dishes were small, and it went quick.

The main course - we ordered a bunch of different stuff for our party of 4.  One order got messed up.  I ordered a Burrito Supremo, but it was more like a Burrito el-blando.  It had no zip to it at all - I've had better Burritos at Food Life in Chicago.

Honestly, I've had better Mexican food at La Mex.  If I'm dying for Mexican food, I guess I'll give it another try, but there has to be better Mexican than this in Champaign.
