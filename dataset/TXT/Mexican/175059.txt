moZpwq1hNxC-uJRpfupOTA Came in with my bachelor party group during Happy Hour Saturday night, which was great because the drinks and appetizers (the potstickers and steak quesadilla) were the best part of the entire meal.

Entrees: Two of us had the chicken fried chicken- it was terrible. The chicken was hammered almost beyond recognition, and the chorizo gravy had no flavor. Seasoned with spice but almost zero salt (this was pretty much the theme for all the entrees- spiced up with chiles, but not salty or seasoned enough otherwise.)

The chimichangas that came out suffered from the same issue- the meat and stuffing weren't seasoned almost at all, and all that came through was the chili taste. The rock shrimp tacos were so poorly seasoned, my friend took one bite and took the rest home in a box :(

Wouldn't ever go back, unless they improved the menu. Cool place and good service, but the food was disappointing to say the least.
