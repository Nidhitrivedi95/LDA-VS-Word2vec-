GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog I am a big fan of Jose Andres. I was interested in the fusion of Chinese and Mexican food. 

I have to say it was good. The waiter, anthony, was able to explain the differences in the tacos ingredients and flavors. 

The manager Steve , was very approachable and worked the room well. It was my first time in and I will definitely be back. 

I had the 20 ingredient rice. It was good. It was really basic fried rice with seasonal ingredients, so not really a must have. 

The when pigs fly was very good. The steamed buns with Chinese pork and BBQ sauce was very flavorful. 

I had several of the tacos. The best was the lamb , Barbacoa Cordero.  Very tasty and buttery. Melted in my mouth. The other favorite was the Barbacoa de Res. The beef was flavorful and tender. My only improvement would be to layer I some more flavors. They could have used some salt and a little
More heat.  

If you are near the cosmopolitan and looking for a great casual place, come into China Poblano. You will enjoy it.
