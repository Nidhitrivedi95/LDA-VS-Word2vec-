PUe3Oz-VAPMXbu_zQ51dYQ I love this place!  As a vegetarian, I have to question authentic Mexican food because I always find little pieces of meat in my food, but I have never had this problem at Guadalajara Bar & Grill.  I order my own combination: two cheese enchiladas and a crispy taco with refried beans.  The food is delicious.  The taco is served on a separate plate so it does not get soggy from the enchilada sauce on the plate.  There usually is a special of 2 combination plates for $11 so the food ends up being really cheap if I go with someone else.
