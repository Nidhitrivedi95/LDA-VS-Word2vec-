F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw I took my friend there last night, she had never been there and she is a CLE foodie. The atmosphere was great.   We split a  Margarita flight and  duck taquitos which was plenty for 2 ladies, we finished with the fried ice cream (which we ordered at 10:15pm after the kitchen closed and they still accommodated us) NICE JOB!!!!

Everything was yummy and the service was excellent.  

The only draw back were the 4 people next to us at the bar that insisted on out talking each other very loudly- LOL
