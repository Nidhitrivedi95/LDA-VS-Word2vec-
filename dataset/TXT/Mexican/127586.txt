HWl2EbZhkhAkFgqt44yUkA Despite all of the negative reviews, I wanted Mexican food and this was the closest place.  The reviews were correct.  Any resemblance between a real Mexican restaurant and this place is purely coincidental.

There is very little to recommend in this place.  The food is edible, but just barely.  To add insult, it is amazingly expensive.  The place tries to be cool and hip, but it fails miserably.  It's true about the staff...there is a boredom that seems to pervade everyone there.  A wasted enterprise...this could be a great experience but whoever runs it needs to go back to the drawing board or sell to someone who knows how to run a Mexican restaurant.
