i-LDatuEXFN3EDZK1sgllQ As soon as we got there the hostess sat us down and quickly brought us our drinks. I ordered the maracuya which is mad from passion fruit. And Wifey ordered the sangria. Let me tell you my aunty would make jugo de maracuya when I was a kid and it's been my favorite. I was surprised to find they make it fresh here!! So delicious! So anyway we ordered the lomo saltado and the paella valenciana and to start off the empanadas and bacon wrapped dates. What a treat our appetizers were amazing. I will warn you normally paella takes a while to make so order it as soon as you get there, if you know thats what your having (it's well worth the wait!) we used to go to Lima Limon for the lomo saltado put we will definitely be coming here instead! Also the best paella in town! My hats off to chef Oscar, well done sir.
