ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA Second time coming here tonight and unfortunately SERVICE AND MANAGEMENT ARE HORRIBLE!!!  the wait staff and management wanted to use excuses for bad service like it wasn't their problem. Not only was the waitress was training someone she didn't even introduce the trainee. she brought my girlfriends drink from the bar finally after We're done eating the appetizer.. Net net: if you make a mistake DON'T tell me your excuses, training people, waiting on big parties. I said we wanted to leave, and not order dinner. She said was it my "service" (lack of service) I said yes it actually was..... She was shocked that I told the truth, then she couldn't handle it and vanished never to return to the table, I had to ask the new trainee for the bill. Not once did either of them get the manager. They tried to charge us for the drink (that we didn't drink) when we said we wanted to go. I said please get the manager, the manager on duty came by and said we were notified of bad service. She Started to to make excuses saying they had too many people, training and had a big party out back and was overwhelmed. Sorry Ocotillo you should be focused on "if you build it people will come" people did come to your huge restaurant and you couldn't show up for the customer in the main food dining area.
