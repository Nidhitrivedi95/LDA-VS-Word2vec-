Great prices and 3 different sizes to choose from, the small is pretty large IMHO :)
Don't forget to try their hot sauce, it's strong and very flavourful, perfect on any burrito.
I love this location's customer service, everyone is super nice and of'course the fact that I can call ahead to order my burrito before picking it up, saves a lot of time.
