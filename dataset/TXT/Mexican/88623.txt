dNDAdeE8olF4eZaslNtBZw Neto, a waiter at Manny's never smiles. He'll stand at your table with his pad, pen, and a smug look on his face without saying a word, to take your order. You might get a "what do you want" or "what do you need"! If you ask him for something, he'll grudgingly gets it for you. He's even flung napkins at us before. We are very patient people and have been there many times because we like the food, but every time he serves us, our family is overtaken by a negative change of mood. We would ask for another waiter but the restaurant is so slow, oftentimes Neto is the only waiter. We've been going to this restaurant for over 12 years, but Neto has only been there for only a few years. We've complained to Manny many times, but evidently Manny doesn't care about the impact this makes on customers who've been loyal for over a decade. Perhaps Manny is afraid of him. You would think Neto would be sat down by Manny and explained the importance of customer service by making customer service a priority and a huge part of Neto's continued employment. I don't want Neto to lose his job, but I also don't want to continue spending my hard earned money in an environment of tension. Our last visit was a lot of the same tension and I'm tired of it. I am an excellent tipper with 20% minimum, but often 30%, and sometimes 100%. Our last visit, I only tipped one dollar. I was so upset I called Manny at the other location but it seemed that he didn't care. It's sad to say but we will not be going back. It's crazy that one employee can destroy business right underneath the nose of ownership. What ever happen to customers first. I guess Manny doesn't realize that there are plenty of other options I.E.- Raul and Teresa's, Rio Mirage, etc.
