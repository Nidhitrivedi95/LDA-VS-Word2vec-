NOfbzTpQ7hrt6ZbJVeXUUw We went there last night and had the best time. The atmosphere is great after a long day of shopping. And Danielle our hostess was WONDERFUL. Later in the evening the manager Shannon came over to our table and she too was very pleasurable. We just stopped in for drinks and chips, the chips are really good and the Blood Orange Margarita was delicious. Thinking of dessert? Try the banana lumpia. When we come back into town, we will be back!
