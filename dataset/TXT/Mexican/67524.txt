BgQ5ob0QiZfO5YbgI7VyFw Came here a month ago with a bunch of coworkers. Everyone really enjoyed their meals.  I loved it so much I made sure to come back while visiting on my next trip. The flagship dish, the Carne Adovada, is ridiculously awesome. The flavors are sincere.  The atmosphere is relaxed and comfy.  Definitely worth coming back for.
