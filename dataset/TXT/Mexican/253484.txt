uZ0C261kg1YgvTMTEmIL0Q I was craving my favorite taqueria in SF so I was asking people where should I go and they said El Norteno. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was not in a strip mall and had two toothless homeless people loitering out front in the "dining" area. I walked by the drunk residentially challenged native person and proceded to the inside to see what they had to offer. The smells were inviting once inside. I ordered a carnitas burrito and some chips and salsa and a horchata to help tame the heat that I was looking for in my burrito. Once I was situated in front of my carnitas burrito I was saddened to see that they had put carne asada in my burrito instead of carnitas. The burrito was tasty none the less and the salsa was delicious and the horchata was cold, and perfectly sweet. Overall I enjoyed my meal however I was not able to completely scratch the itch from my craving.
