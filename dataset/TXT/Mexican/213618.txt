qWi9dNGo9D9I4F9RANc-6g I went here for the first time with my parents from out of town and my boyfriend.  I was pleasantly surprised with how large the restaurant was - it looks small on the outside.  In comparison to Momocho, it's about double in size or maybe bigger.  

El Carnicero has a great atmosphere and I experienced excellent service.  Both the bartender and waitress we had really new the menu items and recommended things they thought we'd like.  I was very happy with my meal (I had a seafood special) and I really enjoyed the goat cheese guacamole and spicy margarita I had.  We all left happy and full! 

I'd definitely go back, it's a gem in Lakewood!
