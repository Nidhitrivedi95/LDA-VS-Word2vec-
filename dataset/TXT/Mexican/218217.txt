rb9B9v8TJk-sjpJe3BbkBQ The chipotle orange salad was fantastic! Looked really good on the website menu so I thought I'd give it a try. I had mine with grilled shrimp, a decent portion by the way for a salad. The chipotle kicked in as I neared the bottom of the bowl lol. The calorie and carb count in this salad was not too bad either, considering the flavor. I'll be enjoying this again soon!
