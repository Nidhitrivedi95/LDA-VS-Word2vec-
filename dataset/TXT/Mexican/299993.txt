Salsa was disappointing, as it had a canned tomato taste. I couldn't quite place it. 

I had the camarones la crema (purposely ordered a comparison dish to my favorite Mexican restaurant for a fair rating), and while it was good, it did not provide me with the mouthgasm that Nuevo Acapulco always does.

Place was very clean, and the service was excellent. Our waiter was watching our table and was very attentive. Prices were reasonable. 

This place was fine, but did not live up to all the hype I've heard. If I had never been to the "other", I'd rate this higher.
