Wc9UpJhOcdSj7olZkz7SJA This is hands down the best burger I've ever had (and I have had A LOT)! I would eat here every day if I could. The restaurant temperature always runs a little warm, but the staff is super friendly, homemade lemonade is to die for, and Stand Sauce is just too good for words. I love this place!
