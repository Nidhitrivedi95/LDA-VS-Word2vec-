n-ESH9vG5gSdq6e8fABwUA Been curious about Bodega for ages and had already had one aborted trip here so was excited by Friday's visit.

Its pretty small and basic but I don't mind no frills as long as the food is good. I think Bodega have some things to finesse as some things are just ok, but others are amazeballs, hence the 4*'s.

The tacos are gluten free and not the cardboard type either. My jerk chicken tacos were good but no spice and I expected some due to the jerk seasoning. I did like the black beans - yum. People had raved about the guacamole but I wasn't wowed. It was fresh but needed a tad more salt and citrus.  

The fish taco's were fab! They made them minus breadcrumbs as I'm gluten free and they were perfectly spiced and the fish was cooked to perfection. 

There are usually only a couple of dessert options and I had pre-ordered an apple burrito. OMG - sticky caramelised apple in a folded burrito with ice cream (cinnamon?) and cream. It was AMAZING! It was one of the best desserts I had had in ages - probably a GF thing mind but it was like having a normally off limits apple strudel. 

So, I'd return for the fish tacos and apple heaven dessert. Bodega is BYOB at £2 so a budget option and there is an Oddbins down the street...
