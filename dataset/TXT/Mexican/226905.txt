S_bG5WWbtNXhhY9Y0GTcSg I really love this place.  The food is top notch.  The decor is nice.  Great location.  It feels exactly like you want it to; comfortable, clean, fun and relaxing.  The only drawback is the service. 

The interior is really nice.  It seems like a country chic cafe.  The seating looks like you won't find anywhere but then it works out.   Waiting for food does not take long.

The food is great.  It tastes fresh and freshly made.  The menu offers a lot o choices and slightly exotic fare.  The prices are reasonable for the food you are getting. Their drip coffee is good.  

I have been to this place often enough to know two things.  I'm going to enjoy the food and I am not going to enjoy ordering my food.   While wait staff, managers and everyone else is friendly and outgoing, the people taking your order at the counter and the coffee barista will make me feel like I am bothering them and I am stupid.  Basic questions either go unanswered or are answered with attitude.  

Overall that brief experience at the counter is no reason not to come to this restaurant.  You will really enjoy 95% of the experience.
