BWmex2gxmeWWFwb6hjKm5Q I haven't visited this restaurant since my first (and only) visit a few years ago...and now I remember why. We stopped in last weekend at 11:30am and aside from the very UNenthused girls working the line, the chicken is kinda rubbery and for the money, it doesn't seem to be a good a value as Salsarita's or Chipotle. 

The manager there is great but the front line staff is NOT friendly, actually bording on rude. They are also disinterested in how you actually would like your order made. Example: when asked if I wanted queso on my burrito, I asked for 'a little'. She gave me a look and slapped a whole serving spoon sized portion on the burrito. When I asked for very little rice, I got a whoooole lotta rice. The only reason I didn't give it one star is the nice manager, cleanliness and the fact that my son loved his kids' meal.
