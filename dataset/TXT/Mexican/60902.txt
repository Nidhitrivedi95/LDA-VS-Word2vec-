aqTdhZDTSjA42_Uh2E6V7A I've been a few times.  The tacos are the stars, as you would expect from the name.  I have tried the chicken and lengua (beef tongue) tacos, and the chorizo burrito.  

The chorizo burrito was pretty good, full of salty, oily ground meat.  No beans inside, just meat  and some veggies, so if that is how you like your burritos, you'll be happy.  

The tacos are the best, though.  Like Mas Amigos, they are served on corn tortillas with onions, cilantro, tomato.  The veggies are fresh and tasty.  The chicken is not bad, a little bland, but there is hot sauce and pickled jalepenos to fix that.  

The lengua is the best and I recommend it even if you don't consider yourself an adventurous eater.  If no one told you it was tongue, it would just seem like slightly salty, slighty fatty, tender beef.  It goes perfectly with the corn tortillas and veggies and it's the way to go.

I haven't tried the tortas, but I'd like to in the future.

Service is usually pretty quick.  Prices are reasonable, I think.  Makes a good snack while doing shopping over on Prospect.
