7tdVsSDXRKtLLC-fD1hJ-A Yum Yum! We went here for a family dinner the other night and had a great time. This place was delicious! Their portions of food are HUGE, everything taste wonderful and the staff was great. I dont think there is a thing on the menu that wouldnt taste good. The only reason for 4 and not 5 star was the wait. It seems that this place gets packed for dinner and the staff is running around like crazy trying to accommodate everyone as much as they can. Maybe they need to hire a few more people to help out with the work load? Other than that, stop by and give them a try I dont think you will be disappointed.
