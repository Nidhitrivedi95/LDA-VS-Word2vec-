LtO6vTBfYzlgWArn3kRe_A I'm not a meat eater and if you are vegetarian, your only options are French fries or a quesadilla. I came because my husband wanted pastor tacos. And he said they were the best ever! He would definitely rate this place high. 

You walk in to a room full of people waiting in lines. There are 3 different lines depending on what kind of meat you want. So you stand in one line and hope they can sneak some meat from the line next to you if you want another type of meat. They are  fast enough but you do sometimes have to wait for people to make up their darn minds. 

My only gripe is that they don't have a salsa bar. So if you forgot to ask for salsa before you left the line, you are screwed because no one will let you back in. Overall an authentic taco place for real Mexican tacos.
