BdzJQypceJ5Bam2P7egoiw Any time I've ordered for delivery, I've never had a problem. However, I've gone in person twice now and both times, I had some issues. The first time, none of the staff wanted to be very helpful or cooperative. They acted as if it was an annoyance for us to be there and were immediately very condescending when they started taking our orders. I went again today and stood at the front of the line for 15 minutes while the staff (only one same person as last time in this group) stood around and argued with eachother. It took an extremely long time to get my lunch, and I would say they were understaffed but there was a group of eight people standing around doing nothing but arguing for a long time while the line of customers got more and more frustrated. 
All of that being said, I'm always very pleased with the food here and I love the convenient location. Would definitely come in to eat more if the staff's organization was better and their time was spent more wisely.
