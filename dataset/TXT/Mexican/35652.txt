5cbsjFtrntUAeUx51FaFTg Love the unique space - inside and out. Of the dozen or so times I've eaten there, I've enjoyed the Fajitas most of these times. All but once they were great. The one time they were too oily - butu you can't be perfect. Plates and glasses and menus are unique. Service 2 out of 3 times is good. Video Poker at the bar and the random stuff on the TV screens (like soccer and non-main stream sports) I can do without. The patio is cool when the weather is appropriate. All in all a good spot for the local market. well done.
