PF6IipxqHx0i2cFBAraXPw I'm a huge Cafe Rio fan! You get a lot of food for a reasonable price. And the food is really yummy! However, this location just doesn't impress me. 
:( 
Today a few coworkers and I went at lunch and 1 person was working the line. It took way longer than it needed too. The cashier was also making us wait to pay while she went back and forth from cleaning the lobby. I feel like that can wait and always should drop what you're doing to take care of the costumer or at least kindly say you'll be right with us. 
The food however is worth it! My favorite is the salad. (Its huge, but makes me feel like I'm eating healthy)  ;) 
The SWEET PORK IS THE BEST! 
After a hit or miss on the service, it's good :)
