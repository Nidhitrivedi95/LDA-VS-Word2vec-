rOHLBGBcWzlxdvNI6squgQ I've eaten Bea's twice now, first dining in & then ordered on GrubHub. Dining in was better, which makes sense I guess. The taquitos are pretty good, the quesadilla not my fave. I'd try it again, but only if my dining partner really wanted to go & was being annoying about it.
