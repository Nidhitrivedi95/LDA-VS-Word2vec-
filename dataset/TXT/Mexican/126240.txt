HU8MnV129kOK4m0ZH4GpCg We went to El Jefe on a friday night after work - the atmosphere was very nice and trendy and it wasn't as busy yet. We wanted to try a few different things to really taste the food so we ordered the guacamole, elote, shrimp/cod corn tortilla taco's and churros. Overall the food was pretty good however our guacamole could have had more salt to bring out the flavor. Our server was new so although she wasn't as helpful to recommend items off the menu, she was still very attentive and nice. 

Overall, I would def give El Jefe a shot - I really liked it!
