Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ The salsa game here is incredible. They might serve other food on that menu but I don't really care. Their salsa verde with avocado is creative and addictive. It's like crack, but slightly easier to get. I tried snorting it so that I could get a better high but the hostess looked at me funny and I stopped. I'm so serious. Even their house red salsa was fantastic. This place serves the second best complimentary chips and salsa that I've ever had in my life. There was a steak thing that was pretty good and a lobster enchilada thing that was pretty good but this review is all about the salsa. Salsa. Eat the Salsa. Eat it. Get full off of it you dumb tourist, you.
