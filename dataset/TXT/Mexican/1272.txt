-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg This taco shop is located in downtown Gilbert. My husband and I decided to give it a try. We stopped right at lunch time and it was moderately busy. We were greeted right away, when the host asked us where we wanted to sit, we asked for a booth inside, but he took us to a table outside, under a tree that was shedding. Normally, on a warm day in AZ you welcome sitting in the shade, but not this time. 
We asked to be moved inside, and we found a booth. Our waitress was by a short time later for our drink orders. The menu is pretty basic, salads, soups, tacos, burritos, sides....I feel the prices are high for what this place is. I feel that 4.50 for one small shrimp taco is high, but that's just my opinion. I ordered the shrimp tacos, 2 of them. Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time. 
The tacos were average. Nothing spectacular. There were 3 big pieces of shrimp, lettuce, tomato and pico de gallo. 
The decor is yuppie, trendy and upscale. The service was okay. Our waitress was friendly, and attentive.
