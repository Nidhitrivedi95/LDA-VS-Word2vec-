JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg We use to come here quite a bit when they first opened. They use to offer half off to locals and industry on Mondays ... I was never sure how they managed this... But I never complained. I believe they offer 20 percent off to locals now, although... No one has ever offered it or advertised it to us in recent months...

I love that they offer organic, non gmo food and have an array of vegan options:) however, their price point is kind of ridiculous for the location and the atmosphere. $16 for guacamole? I'm not trying to be a jerk, but where are they getting their avocados? The mark up is ridiculous. I paid $19 for two vegan lettuce wraps with black beans and rice. If you go with a friend, only one of you should order the beans and rice. They upcharge and there is enough for two. 

The drink prices are reasonable, and they offer a wide variety of different tequilas. Their service is okay... not overly friendly... not overly quick... however, they are efficient and that's good enough. I really use to like to this place, but I've had better Mexican food at lower price points. The biggest plus... they are open 24/7 and offer healthier options than bar food. Give them a try for their happy hour.
