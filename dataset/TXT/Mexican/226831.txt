S_bG5WWbtNXhhY9Y0GTcSg Amazing! The food portions are quite small but it's bloody delicious. The taste, the presentation, the flavor, the quality of food, and the ambience. The pastrys are tasty, and the menu has great variations. The omelet is a must! The coffee is just perfect. Sometimes the service slows and requests take quite a time (we request a sauce at the beginning and got it at the end of meal). I'm becoming a regular to the spot!
