9Bg2JLQdyf97KlNuRQ56HA Ewwww! Why isn't there a zero star! First of all it's very run down and when my friend and I tried to sit down, none of the tables were clean enough to eat on and when we sat down at a table, this worker came over and stared wiping down the table like we weren't even there! Like what a creep! 

Then I ordered fries and my friend ordered a burrito. It took about twenty minutes to finally bring out the food. In the fries, they were pretty good besides all the HAIR! That's just gross and disgusting! I threw away all the fries and then the workers have me dirty looks like "did you really just throw away those perfectly good fries?" Umm no I threw away disgusting, hairy fries.

Inside the burrito, my friend almost choked on a cheese wrapper! He coughed and then spit it out and held up a cheese wrapper! When we tried to get our money back, the worker refused to give money back to "un-responsible little kids". My friend and I got ticked off and had to leave without our eight dollars.

Anyway, not worth it for the "so-called cheap Mexican food". I would rather go spend my money on expensive Mexican food or MCDONALDS! So not worth it :l
