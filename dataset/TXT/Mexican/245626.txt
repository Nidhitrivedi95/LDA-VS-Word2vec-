TrJvNiNo6yt2lfkSOc6E_w I will start by acknowledging that we went to Cozumel on Valentine's Day. We expected and were okay with it being a little hectic. But everything from  our drinks (at $12.50 for a top shelf margarita, we couldn't believe they were tasteless, watery, zero alcohol and... carbonated?!) to our food (tamales and enchiladas) cold inside and simply not tasty) was so awful that we would never return. Sad, since we aren't THAT picky and were excited about finding a Mexican place within 10 minutes of home.
