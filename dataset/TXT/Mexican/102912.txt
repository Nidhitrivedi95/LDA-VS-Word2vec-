Mexican is not my favorite thing in the world, but Momocho impressed me, making the cuisine creative and interesting without veering into Tex Mex territory. I certainly haven't had anything like it before.

I wanted to try their chevre guacamole so bad, but one of my friends is vegan so instead we had pineapple. It was so very fresh, and although I prefer more garlic, I could not stop eating it. I had to force myself though so I had room for my amazing lamb taquito. Usually the uniform texture of ground meat is a turnoff for me, but the addition of ground walnuts provided a perfect crunchy contrast. All of the taquitos on the menu sounded amazing, but I think I made a good choice.

We finished with the jalapeño bread pudding. If you were born without a sweet tooth, like me--get this! I love a little bit of savory in my desserts. And I can't forget to mention the cucumber margarita. At first, i wasn't sure if I liked it (oddly enough, while I'm not a big fan of sweet food, I generally go the opposite with drinks. but who can resist cucumber...not me!). It kind of tasted like spicy pickle juice...but after I acclimated myself with those first few odd sips, I decided I was in love. It was unusual for sure, but refreshing. I can imagine this as a perfect brunch drink.

In all honesty, I would come back to Cleveland just to eat at Momocho again. Who's down for a roadtrip?
