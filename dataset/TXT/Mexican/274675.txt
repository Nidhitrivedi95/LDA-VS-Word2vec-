x7RRLRKyKdME9X3GuR5-5w The atmosphere and staff are pleasant and it has a well rounded menu for a family oriented Mexican Restaurant.  I found the food to be bland. The refried beans seemed to be canned and the rice a mix. The food was well prepared and presented but I just expect more flavor in Mexican food. (I am not confusing flavor with spicy) The Margaritas were ok but you need to order a top shelf to get a really good one. Chips and Salsa ok, but my companion thought both to be store bought and not prepared fresh.
