ZbHE1ZncONeH-q93GuVGdA I've been going here since they first opened, and even after their name changed from Roberto's to Don Tortaco, the food still tastes great.  

I love their warm, authentic mexican tortillas!  I usually always get a burrito, but every now and then I get a chicken taco from here too.

There are 3 things that make me very happy about this restaurant:  1) you can custom design the ingredients of your burrito, and it still stays cheap;  2) their chicken is shredded and marinated with a light broth, which keeps the chicken meat moist and tender;  and  3) I like their self serve salsa bar, lots of variety of add ons:  sliced radishes, cilantro, onions, jalepeno & carrot mix, limes, green onions, and even diced cucumbers.

Having this location nearby and open 24 hours are added perks for me!
