TOrphxql7UfJ77vXG4G4aQ Worst customer service,I ordered 15 pupusas by phone the lady said 45 minutes when i got there it was 45 minutes and my order was not ready i kept asking the lady and she was very rude,an hour passed and my order was still not ready i got mad and told her that i wanted my food because an hour passed she didn't care and kept taking orders from customers that were coming in the restaurant she just told me to tell her if i wanted to wait for my food or cancel it and she would give my order to someone else so i just left.The second thing is that she put her gloves on started making pupusas and kept answering the phone and touching the register with the gloves on and then she returned to make more pupusas without changing her gloves.
