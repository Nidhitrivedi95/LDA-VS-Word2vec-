AhQu7mLtmGlp8U2I-SV_jA It's open late. It's on West 9th. It's semi-healthy (depending on what you get), which is good because you most likely drank your weight in alcohol. Or at least felt like it.

I've been here when intoxicated, and it just seemed like a Chipotle for me. I was thankful for the brown rice, and the other unique options they seemed to have. I stuck to what I was used to, a veggie burrito bowl. It tasted fine, nothing really that blew me out of the water and nothing that disappointed me either.

 I'll be back (sober) to try it and give a proper review. Three stars for now.
