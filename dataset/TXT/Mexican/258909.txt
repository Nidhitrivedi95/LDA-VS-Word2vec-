VnvRZia9M18-IUarfdnYfA The first couple times I came here it was good food and good service.  It has gone down hill (by a lot).  When I first started going, the portion sizes were good, but not anymore.  I always order a veggie burrito bowl and when they are making it they ask, "veggies?"...Well yes, I am ordering a VEGGIE burrito bowl.  Then they only put a tiny bit of their pepper and onion mix into the bowl.  You'd think that for the price (almost the same as the meat burritos) that they would put some extra veggies in a veggie bowl (or at least enough to make it worthwhile).  Anyways, the food is usually fresh, but i have stopped going since I have found much better burrito spots to go to now.
