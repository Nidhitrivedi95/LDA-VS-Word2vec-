WGFJbxzhO44Ku05BM1hDjA I would not suggest this place. The service was extremely slow, the food was subpar, and our waiter was very lazy. I have a dietary restriction and when I asked a question about a few meals he simply told me he didn't know, when I asked if he could find out he said he was "pretty sure" which for my dietary restriction isn't an okay answer. He wouldn't go check for me. 
I give this 2 stars because I suppose it could always be worse, but we will not be returning.
