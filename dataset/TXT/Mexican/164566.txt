LkgqiRF3LaZCVQmDFC0AaA My gf and I came here as she had heard about the place - decided to try it out.

Decor is really nice - well lit, nicely done. You can go play table tennis while waiting for your food (really nice touch) - so didn't mind waiting slightly extra for the food. The place was slowly getting full - means they get business.

The server was super nice but didn't know the drinks menu well - they say ask about the daily special but he had no clue. Anyways, had some tequila and beer. At least he redeemed himself when he refilled our dip for free.

Food - this is where I got lost. Tiny little tacos - pretty much bite-size. Flavor was absolutely missing. Really disappointing. Had the dessert ice-cream which had a nice big fat piece of frozen ice in it. Small portion as well.

I am not a fussy eater - but if the food is nothing special, I expect a small price. But not the case here. One of those little tiny bite-size tacos is around $6. To get a decent meal you need minimum 4 - good luck paying $24 for some tasteless tacos. 

Giving this place 2 stars only because of the nice decor and the concept with the table tennis. Otherwise hard to give points on anything.

And to end it - credit card reader was not working. Good thing I had some cash on me.
