ms7cmWkPiSBDTnz-1sv2kQ An explosion of flavor dancing on my tongue!  The Saturday night drink special was awesome.  I was thinking it'd be a weak drink...nope...it was strong and good.  $1.99 you call Vodka well drinks.  I chose a Vodka and Cranberry...  potent!

Now on to dinner... Coconut Ginger Curry with Shrimp.  Just the right amount of spice for my sissy tongue  :)  The shrimp were succulent and flavorful.

My dinner guest opted for the enchilada and was pleased with his selection.  

We saved room for dessert....how can you not with a gem like Tortilla Bread Pudding on the menu.  I really didn't think I'd like it because of the tortilla part, but WOW, it was fantastic.  Layers of soft tortillas with chocolate and cinnamon, served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Word to the wise...get it to share.  It was sweet enough and big enough to send me into a delicious diabetic coma and soooo darn good.  The two of us couldn't finish it, what a shame!

We will be back!
