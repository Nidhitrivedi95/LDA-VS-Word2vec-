Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ Meh...Came here for chips and salsa and some margaritas. We originally wanted to people watch on The Strip, but unfortunately, it was super windy outside, so we weren't able to sit outside. However, on a good weather day, I think that their bar-style seats outside overlooking The Strip would be perfect for this! 
We only tried the chips, salsa and guac, and overall was pretty underwhelmed. The guac was really plain. The margaritas were decent though. The interior feels like a little bit tacky -- but after all, we are in Vegas.
