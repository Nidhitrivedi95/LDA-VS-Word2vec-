Had a breakfast burrito with chicken. It simply tasted terrible. I can't say it was the recipe or food itself or maybe it just wasn't my thing but it was terrible none the less. Coffee was extremely bitter and topped off the expensive lesson. It's the airport so maybe I should just accept that it will be sub par.
