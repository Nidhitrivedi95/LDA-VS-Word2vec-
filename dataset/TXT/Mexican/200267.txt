pDewiJY6KCcZgLxxgxg13Q I was taken to this place after landing in Phoenix, by a friend that lives locally. I was told it was one of the best Mexican restaurants in the area. I can't tell about others in the area but I can speak on this one. It was a darn good choice. 

The wait to eat was about 20 minutes and staff were friendly. Once we were seated, we were helped by a kind fellow named "Israel". He answered all questions and always came to the table with a smile. This I greatly appreciated. 

I ordered the machaca. This was my first time eating this so I don't know where it compares to others but it was absolutely amazing. The taste of the steak, eggs, jalapeno, onions, and tomatoes created a beautiful collaboration that danced upon my tastebuds for the evening. The horchata was very good, as it always should be.

If I should return to Phoenix, this is definitely on my hit list.
