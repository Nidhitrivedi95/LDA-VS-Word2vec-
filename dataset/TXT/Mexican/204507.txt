psTL09zta37SOlqaVj6csw I really enjoyed Hacienda every time I went there. It's great for groups large and small. Super entertainment, good quality food, tasty cocktails. Always a good time. It doesn't hurt to call ahead for a reservation at prime dining times because the restaurant does fill up, especially if the band or dancers are performing.
