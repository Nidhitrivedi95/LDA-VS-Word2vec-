HqerocZHKSRFD8NTrIkbaw On Sat 5/6/17, we decided to follow someone's suggestion and try Taxco Mexican Grill.  After seeing the bad reviews that were left on 5/5/17 - which is surely their busiest day of the year - we went anyway.  Great decision!!  They were NOT busy since apparently everyone was there the day before!!! Therefore, we had excellent service, a great pitcher of top-shelf margarita, and good food. Their salsa isn't really spicy, but still good, and I truly did like the fact that they bring a smaller basket of chips - unlike many restaurants that will load you up with them.  My husband had the grilled chicken salad and I had a 2 choice combination: 1 chorizo taco and a chile poblano with rice & beans.  Both of our dinners were very good, and we had a good time.  :D
