XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Food was outstanding, service was slow but impecable. Their menu is unique and offers quite distinct combinations (ground coffee rubbed sirloin, and manchego filled chile rellenos). It is a mix of South American food with a modern Mexican twist.The ambience is chic, but area is roomy (hard to find in Vegas). 

Entrees run high on the price range, and they do not come with sides (the brussel sprouts with candied pecans and cranberries was delicious!). Every item was impressive, but again pricey for what you are getting, but then again... you are in Ceasar's palace.... All in all very pleased with our night!
