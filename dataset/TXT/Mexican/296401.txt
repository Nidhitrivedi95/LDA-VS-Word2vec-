zCmwErM82hdKl4L2UixDJw Barrio! Barrio! Barrio!  I really wanted to give you a really good rating but the food did not meet our expectations.  We waited an hour to be seated on a Tuesday night.  The guacamole was probably the worst I've ever had.  The tacos were cold.  Very cold!  You can tell that this place chops up the vegetables early in the day, keeps them cold, and then throws them in a tortilla or taco shell.  This is not what I would ever call Mexican food. Sorry!  The Cranberry margarita was good but you could not taste the tequila.  This place is also very noisy, it's actually crazy noisy.  My children actually witnessed several people who were highly intoxicated which made them feel extremely uncomfortable.

What did I enjoy?  I liked the decor.  The manager and our server were amazing!

Will I be going back? Absolutely not.
