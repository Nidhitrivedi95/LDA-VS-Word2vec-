JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg My boyfriend and I came here last night and it was amazing!  Right when we walked, in the delicious smells hit our noses...mmm we couldn't wait to eat!  

We sat at the bar while we waited for a table.  The wait wasn't even that long (I think it's funny when people complain about wait times or the restaurant being booked for private parties..sorry things get busy and it happens!)

We had the tableside guacamole with the complimentary chips and salsa to start.  For our entrees we had the taco plate with al pastor/carnitas and the cochinita pibil.  We also had the Mexican street corn.   Everything was so delicious..the best Mexican food I've probably ever had!  

The service was also excellent, even though they were busy with it being Cinco de mayo.
