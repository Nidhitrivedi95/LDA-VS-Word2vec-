nIwtGMkMyx0elLxVFs1D6A Best margaritas in Bloor west!! Been meaning to go here for ages and I wasn't disappointed. Except I wish I had come sooner and in summer for the patio. 
Mexican chorizo tacos were my fav!! Although the guacamole is home made and beautiful too. 
Owners are super nice and make you feel like you're in their home kitchen. I'll definitely be back.
