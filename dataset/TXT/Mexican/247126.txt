TxQBdyDktZSk1KVTWh71dw Having tried to get into Bakersfield and failed, we walked down the street and decided to try Babalu Tapas and Tacos.   I was extremely happy we did.

The tacos were extremely fresh, and really delicious.  The street corn side where they actually cut the corn off the cob before serving it was a 10, and we also had the goat cheese broccolini which is the best way to eat vegetables... with goat cheese. 

I got the home made blue soft tacos - one of three different kinds.  My favorite by far was the grilled shrimp, but I also enjoyed the carnitas taco.  Service was pretty good, but not special.  I really liked the atmosphere - it is clean and bright... I believe they also had valet parking although we had walked over.

Then came the bill, which was easily the best part.  For two people with beer, our entire meal was $40.  I also left full.  I have been looking for a good fresh and light taco place, and this will absolutely be it for me.   I love Cabo and Sabor but they aren't really fresh or a light taco place.
