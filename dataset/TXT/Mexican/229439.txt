sDyTfafJfhb_5ewii6TEjg For Toronto, half decent burritos, but really now, that's not saying much. 

Yes, this is better than Taco Bell, but it's not good Tex-Mex.  Also a bit pricey for what you get (about $10 for a burrito), the meat isn't especially good, nor are the beans or guac.  Chips are generally stale and flavorless, and the salsa is mediocre.  If you come from our friends to the south, just pass on this place, you're going to be disappointed with Toronto Mexican food here for the most part.

If you're in the mood for Mexican and don't mind a slight drive, I'd recommend driver over to El Sombrero at Hurontario and 401.  It's a bit pricey as well for Mexican food, but it's actually Mexican food!!
