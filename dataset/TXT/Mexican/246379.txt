TUpyKJFqL_ySZMo54pT-Sw Waited in line for at least 20 minutes and we came to this ice cream place bc they advertise the protein ice cream and I've been looking forward to trying it. The lady at the counter said they stopped serving that a while ago.... Then the other 2 people that I was with wanted coffee ice cream in which they didn't have any either. I'm sure their ice cream is good but when we had 2 specific things in mind and they didn't have either we just turned around and left. Disappointing...
