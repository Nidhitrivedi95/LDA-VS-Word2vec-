qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A We were lucky enough to spend time off the strip for our vacation last October, and a friend who lives nearby recommended DW Bistro, and we were in love!

Being foodies from PDX, we considered this place to be absolutely fantastic, rivaling and topping a lot of breakfast restaurants here. From the coffee to the Cuban Benedict, to the most fabulous carrot cake.  Each bite was savored for the beautiful flavors on the tongue, and sadness abounded after the last bite.  

The service was attentive and wonderful, I was sad that we could not make it out there a second time before we left.
