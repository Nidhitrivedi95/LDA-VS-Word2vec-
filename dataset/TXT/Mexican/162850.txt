LBBp51YHui5gvXNSyUcLKg Food is good, a bit of the greasy and messy side. I went around the end of the lunch rush and it was quick to get seated and order in. The food took a long time to come out and the waitress did not check on us to refill drinks or anything. We probably waited about 20 minutes for the food to come out. That seems like a long time for a lunch rush. Overall food is good, and typical, value was on the average side.
