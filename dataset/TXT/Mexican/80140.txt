cwsxAGssF-DBU-Gj9_yg9Q I came to Montreal visiting from NJ and just passed by this place and it seemed interesting from the outside. 

This small Mexican place had the best torta I have ever had in my life. The tinga de pollo torta is delicious. I wish it were a little cheaper but the quality and taste is magnificent. The restaurant setting is filled with interesting toys and a vintage feel so it is a nice place for a hangout.
