CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q Quality of there food has gone down alot the size of the taco you get is alot smaller from when they first started in Chula Vista Ca, taco's where alot bigger and full with meat and flavor, but seems like they reach there clientele so they did what most food chains do and cut back so they can get more profit! 
                     I DON'T RECOMMEND
