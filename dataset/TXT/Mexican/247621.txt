U_jPOTd-Z5KATbTYnDeNxg This place was delicious.  I've been wanting to try it for a while but haven't gotten a chance till today.  I got the large bean and cheese burrito with everything (they have a good selection of proteins: chicken,  pork,  steak,  fish).  The burrito itself was great and pretty filling.  They have the option of whole wheat or white flour tortillas.  I got the whole wheat which was very good and grilled very nicely.  The contents of the burrito were delicious and tasted and looked fresh.  I asked for everything,  so my only complaint is that I either didn't get cilantro and jalapeños or they ran out,  to be fair I wasn't looking when they put it together so I couldn't tell them I especially wanted it after I put in my order.  The burrito sauce wasn't too hot but had a nice punch to it,  if I noticed the sauce options I would have went for hot. 

I'm pretty excited to try their quesadilla next. 

Update: I got the soya mix quesadilla,  not great.  I wouldn't recommend. Stick to the burritos.
