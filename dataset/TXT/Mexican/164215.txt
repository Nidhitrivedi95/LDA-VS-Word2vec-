LiBnff-ZuzW16zIvZgFOfQ A friend and I decided to stop by here the day before Thanksgiving because we weren't too keen on our other options.

The restaurant itself is nothing exciting, but as previously stated by other reviewer's it has been in business for a long time.

I ordered the chimichanga plate which came with beans, rice, guacamole, and sour cream. The food itself was average, but the portions are pretty generous, and you won't go home hungry. The service satisfactory and we never needed to ask for anything.
