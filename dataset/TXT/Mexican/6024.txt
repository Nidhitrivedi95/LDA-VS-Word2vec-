_eYGcch95eygN_b_rigUkg I used to drive to one of the few of the stores in town and now there is one closer to my house. It seems to be smaller but has all of the great things that keeps me shopping here. I always stop for an Aqua Fresca when entering the store and then start to shop. The deli has so many of my favorite cuts of meat and can be purchased already marinated if you like. The have fresh made tortillas and chips in one section and right next to it already cooked meats. I recommend the carnitas! The restaurant area has many choices for snacking or a full lunch or dinner selection. Welcome to the neighborhood and I will be a frequent customer.
