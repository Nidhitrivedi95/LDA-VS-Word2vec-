S_bG5WWbtNXhhY9Y0GTcSg Great food, even better coffee. 
We've been here 3 times. The third time, my coffee was (misplaced? made and handed to someone else? Not sure). When I inquired about the coffee, they made sure it was at my table ASAP. Someone came over to apologize and offered me a mimosa on the house (I declined, but next time YAASSS) for the hiccup. So nice of them! 

Sometimes it gets crowded and loud, as it is a smaller place, and there's not a ton of parking. 

The same girl (Stephanie, maybe?) is usually on the register and is quick, efficient and accurate. Super friendly and always greets us with a smile.
