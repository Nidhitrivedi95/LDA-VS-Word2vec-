ckQdUPdUOX18yOhE2aV8sA Im not sure where everybody who gave this dump over 2 stars were eating.  Bland, awful food.  Had the steak with cheese enchilada, med rare.  They should rename it shoe leather and mush.  It was terrible.  Burnt beyond recognition with a greesy tiny mushy mucky guess it was an enchilada next to it.  We also got a chicken burrito.  If you boil a chicken in plain water and shred it there would have been more flavor than this tasteless meat in a tortilla.  Beans were paste the only flavor was the salt and pepper I put on them, which I never put salt and pepper on anything but had to do something!  The only thing fellow yelpers got right was the decor was hideous.  If they are going for a look of actual Mexico they nailed it minus the flies and dogs on the floor, however, I would go to Mexico and sit in a dump that looked like this if the food was even halfway decent. The candle on top was the worst bathroom ever.  My pic of the bathroom sums up the entire eating experience here.  I won't be so quick to trust yelp reviews ever again because apparently they have no idea what good Mexican food taste like
