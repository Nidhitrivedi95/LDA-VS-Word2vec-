XxXmyN3tlroRQ1SOoSXHAA We drove from Tucson to attend our friends 70th Birthday celebration. 
   The hosts had reserved a private area in the restaurant for their guests. 
  We were having a good time . There was a friend who brought his guitar and was playing Mexican music for the guests and the Birthday girl
  Most of the guests were in their sixties or older. The service was fair ; the food was good... BUT then.. the cake came out, it was a ice cream cake that clearly had not been put in a freezer area as it was a puddle! Just as the cake soup was being served.. the owner of the restaurant came into the room and started yelling at the top of his lungs for everyone to leave. (mind you this was an hour before the party was to end) The host was Terribly embarrassed  in front of her guests . The owner claimed there were intoxicated people that were smoking  cigarettes in the restaurant (which was not true.)
  I personally would have taken the host or hostess to the side and explained why I was unhappy rather than come into the room yelling and making a scene! That was completely uncalled for!!
  I don't live in Mesa , so I probably won't be retuning to this restaurant but I can say this , the 30 people that attended this party won't return either and after hearing this story told to 10 of their friends each, there goes 300 potential customers out the door. 
   Nice going boss man. How's that going to work in your favor?
