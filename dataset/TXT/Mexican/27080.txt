3CI95LMvt4u1xqEWq6CbnQ La Mexicana is an authentic, delicious and small little joint tucked away on Bathurst. 
The service is always A+ with waiters and waitresses very attentive to your needs. The food tastes authetically delicious and they have many options from burrito's to quesadilla's to even elote! My favorite is to get the enchilada's with beef - the beef is super soft and tender. They always give free chips and salsa (home made) to start and the churro's are divine. The best part about this place is that they serve HALAL meat so to all my Muslim friends who are looking for a mexican place, this ones for you. 

I would def. recommend this place for authentic, delicious mexican food! :)
