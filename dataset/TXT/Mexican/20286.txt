1ZJz840L496LAmQdeDv0WA This was my 2nd visit and it didn't disappoint. I got the Piches Combo, three tacos, beans, rice and chips all for under $10. I tired three different tacos, pollo, asada and fish.AllI were great, can't decide which I liked best. Looking forward to back and trying something new.
