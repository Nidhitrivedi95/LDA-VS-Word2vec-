giCq1MmW-_S2tvNOAHvJcQ Went to the wine store and the Tavern on a Thursday evening with family. Top notch service and unique menu with divine food! We all loved our meals and appetizers. Strongly suggest the butternut squash fettuccine, any burger and lettuce wraps. The restaurant is dimly lit and comfortable. Also, don't miss out on the wine store next door. They had an awesome professional sommelier that helped us pick an outstanding bottle of wine!
