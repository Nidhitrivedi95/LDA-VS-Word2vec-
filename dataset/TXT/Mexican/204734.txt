pugciBzSCFqa_vn-X5pcEQ This place is awesome! They are new so working out the kinks, but great place to kill your appetite. They have a little bit of a taco truck feel but have great dine-in facilities. The food was so tasty and everything was fresh when we ordered. The refried beans were made fresh in front of you as all the other meats and add-ins. The staff was ridiculously friendly and made you feel like one of their own. The prices were very reasonable and with the taste I would have paid more, completely worth every bite. Glad this place opened up!
