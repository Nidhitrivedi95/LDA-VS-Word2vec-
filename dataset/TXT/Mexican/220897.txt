rjlAUHT8B6KhKAmkZqS1xw Best patio, best margaritas, and the best happy hour! Where has Ladera been all of my life?! Don't skip the street style corn- we ordered it off of the cob and it made a tasty dip for their tortilla chips. Tacos are all fab but what makes the meal is the mouth-watering cinnamon churros. There might be butterscotch in the middle but we devoured them too fast. It is heaven. We will be back!
