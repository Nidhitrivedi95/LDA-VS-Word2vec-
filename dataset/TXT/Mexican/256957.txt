vhwkE0ql1g_uUkDtxCHzSA If only Moes was this close when i was in school.. at least when I attend football games and visit friends I can count on stopping here and fueling up. I haven't had a bad experience yet with this store and I understand some places just starting can have issues with getting the ball rolling. I've been probably 4+ times now and am still satisfied. 

What prompted me to leave this review was the service I had during my last visit. Mike, whom I believe to be some type of manager/higher up, was extremely helpful and super nice. They had what seemed to be some new hires learning the ropes. I couldn't really tell because I got through the line with my friends in tow without any trouble. He thanked us for our patience but that was still faster then McDonald's sometimes!! 

You should know what Moes is about by now so I'm not going to describe the food. It's good every time I go. WELCOME TO MOES!
