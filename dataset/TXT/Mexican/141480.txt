jBKJMUcMuBmHqe5_U7GQ0Q Great service and atmosphere but the food is not that great.

The restaurant is in a plaza and doesn't look like much on the outside.  Inside it appears you walked into a sterotypical Mexican restaurant.  It has alot of bright colors around with Mexican type decor.

The tables are very private.  The service was great, polite waiters and things were served timely.  The waiter also kept my drink full, which is about all you half to do to make me happy!

They do provide chips and salsa as soon as you sit down.  For me, this was the best part of the meal.  They have great salsa and the chips are light and crunchy!

I got 2 enchiladas and a taco.  They were all beef and there was no spice to the beef at all.  It tasted just like fried ground meat.  I could have made them better at home.  I realize that not all Mexican food is meant to be spicy but it should have some type of flavor to it.  My meal came with rice which was pretty good.  The rice was soft but not chewy!

The price is pretty good as well, $8 for lunch.

If you want a quick edible meal this is the place.  i probably will not go back anytime soon.  

They do have Happy Hour specials - maybe they make better margaritas!
