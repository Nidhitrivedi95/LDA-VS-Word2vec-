UoRSHohdGuzfrpydZ9j0Lg Luchitas is hands down delicious! I'm always there for Taco Tuesday!! The staff is extremely polite and always doting on you while you wait for your food. The food.. omg.. the food! The cheese, the meat, the sauce!! It's all amazing. I could sit there and simply eat the chips and salsa for days. Love this place, highly recommend!
