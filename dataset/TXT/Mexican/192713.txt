OMEbwr0Aybw_wnqvno-6zQ I've had better food at Taco Bell. I was so disappointed in the food here I don't know where to start. First off the chips were too thin for my taste. It kept breaking every time I tried to get some dip. I got one of the combos that come with chicken. enchilada and chicken chalupa. It looked almost the same as my friend's combo, who had a Taco and enchilada???? If anything my chalupa looked more like a tostada. It came with rice and beans. I told my server that I didn't eat beans he stated he would give me two sides of rice. When the food came I got beans and rice. (Honest mistake, I told the runner that gave us the food. She told me she would bring it out and we never got it) I usually eat all my food...my friend and I ate less than half of both of our foods. The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because our server was nice and refilled our cups and chips often. The nacho bar that was included with our meal was nice, though there was only three things to select from. It probably woulda been better to have salsa or hot sauce available at the bar. With that being said though, I also added points for the dips we got at the table (salsa and guacamole). Just for those two points though, I wouldn't come and eat their food again. I might come back for some drinks because they looked good but that's it lol.
