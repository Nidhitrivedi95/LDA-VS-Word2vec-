The service is really nice and friendly as well, and I'm pretty sure most of the waiters speak spanish which is a good sign when you're eating in a south american place!
So why only 3 stars? I love mexican/southern food so maybe I'm a slightly harsh critic, but I just wasn't really taken with the menu. 
Everything we ordered was a bit too overflowing with cheese and creme fraiche so the vibrant flavours were drowned out. The menu isn't really expensive, £15 for 2 courses, but considering the fierce competition with set menus in Edina, it's probably a touch high for such simple food (plain rice, beans, chicken, flour tortillas and side salad)
