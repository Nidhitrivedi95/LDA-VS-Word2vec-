iBlQvqiy5Rg2h-y9TS1yOA The dynamic duo of Stefany and Bethany find another good happy hour! 

Our adventure landed us at Casa del Matador.  It's located in the Summerlin Mall.  Since it's easy to get lost in the maze of stores, just look for Andiron & Ethan Allen.  There is so much parking that I don't foresee any issue finding a spot. 

We automatically walked over to the bar area to enjoy the HH specials.  With good prices and variety, we split nachos, calamari, quesadilla and stuffed jalapeños.  I can feel you judging me but it's ok in Yelp world.  

The Nachos are huge for happy hour.  For $5 you get a large portion topped with cheese, black beans, pico, guac and sour. Cream. Pretty fantastic.  The mushroom quesadilla was so delicious.  It was well filled with ingredients and also served with guac and sour cream.  The calamari was your standard fare.  Just ok so I probably wouldn't recommend that item.  

Looking for some hot stuff? The grilled stuffed jalapeños had a great spicy kick which made them my fav.  Cheese stuffed jalapeños wrapped in bacon with a dipping sauce on the side.  Well anything wrapped in bacon is usually a winner.  This was no exception.   I loved every bite.  

Service could have been a little more attentive but both guys behind the bar were friendly.  I certainly enjoyed their Happy Hour.  With options ranging from $2-$6, it's a safe bet you'll find something.  Muy Bueno!
