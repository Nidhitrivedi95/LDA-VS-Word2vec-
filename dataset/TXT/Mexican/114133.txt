gEv1Og5uGDLw9HkbKSGUZw The service was amazing!  Thanks to Nicole - our Tequila Master - we were able to enjoy our cocktails before dinner and learn much about the Tequila being poured!  Tables are very cramped so you get to meet your neighbours :-)  ... Food was good - the ribs are extraordinary!  The sauce was spicy and not too sweet - a little too much on the smashed potato that came with it - but still really yummy.  Tacos were excellent with the exception of the beef brisket - which tasted a bit dodgy and was promptly removed from the bill.  No problem - great service and fun atmosphere!  It was a good evening!  Will be back!
