gOpOoZgrF2shRLCBBzO3Mw Good little dive type place to get a burrito. No indoor seating but there is a covered/shaded area with 10 tables or so. Closes at 2pm so it's really just a lunch and breakfast place.  

I had 'Connies Favorite' which was pretty good and had a ton of tender chicken on it. My wife had the 'chorizo con papas' and she loves it, a little too much chorizo for my liking. 

Just remember this is rated 4 stars for what it is, it's not a classy joint, just a dive with decent tasting food and decently priced food.
