lWmDrnqgU6w3gFaJyn_1Uw Ordered off the tapas menu and had a delicious meal.  Big fan of the roasted garlic and also the eggplant.  The pictures on yelp are very true to the dishes.  The service was attentive, but I was close to assisting the waiter with opening our wine bottle.  It was painful watching him struggle.   Overall really nice outside dining experience.
