R54Sh5Y3zjtZt7MjdfwDZA Been there maybe 25 times. 90% of the time their salmon burrito is excellent, fresh, healthy, you can just feel the omega 3s making you smarter as you eat it. Two times though they overcooked it and used non-fresh lettuce which tasted bad. And one time I got sick, possible food poisoning.
