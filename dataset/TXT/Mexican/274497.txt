X6YpIqhaP_qoSZJRBcivGw This is the only Mexican food restaurant that my husband and I go to on a regular basis. This is the ORIGINAL Garcia's, it is not part of the chain.  We have been eating here since the 1980s and drive from Goodyear when we want good, simple Mexican food.  We have had many family celebrations and regular meals here over the years and hope to continue for many more.

Yes, as stated in other reviews the service can be a little under par at times but everyone has a bad day now and then, right?  And most of the wait staff are friendly and accommodating to our requests.  If you have a problem with the staff or the food just speak with a manager and she will make it right.

The food is good and the portions are generous; the frozen Margaritas are the best I have ever had anywhere.  Just the fact that many other hispanics eat here is proof to me that this is authentic and good Mexican food and lots of other folks eat here too, LOL.  Just stating that they have a diverse clientele.

The restaurant looks a little tired these days but is still acceptable; could use a little 'refreshing'.  

The location is a little bit rough but nothing to be worried about during the day; at night you should just be careful.  If you are knowledgeable about the area you know what I mean.
