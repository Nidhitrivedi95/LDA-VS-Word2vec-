Large, clean, and bustling.

It's right around the corner from us, so we come semi-regularly.  Service has always been solid.

The menu is huge.  You can stick to "typical" Mexican restaurant combo plates, or you can venture into more authentic options and things you won't find elsewhere.  Such as their Chicken Soup, which was awesome with tons of white chicken in a bowl large enough to fillup Fred Flintstone.

The most authentic?  Assuredly not.  Good food, served fast, hot, and tasty?   Yes indeed.
