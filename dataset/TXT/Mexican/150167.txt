jsuUmIEefPjV__ads62Z5w Add this to the list of 1 star reviews on account of bad customer service. The issue: I have been trying all week to make a reservation for 15 people for lunch on Thursday. I made no fewer than 10-15 calls to all 3 restaurants and 4 different numbers; left messages for all the managers; visited twice; spoke to possibly 10 different people altogether; at one point, seemingly, got on someone's nerves because I was calling too often (even though I wasn't getting calls back as I was told I would); even texted someone I was told to text. Not one response. A classic case of everyone passing the buck and nobody wanting to make a decision. All for what? To buy the place? No. Of course not. To make a reservation for 15 for lunch. Why? Because a lunch here is my brother's bachelor party wish between hiking Piestewa in the morning and playing ultimate frisbee in the afternoon. When I walked in there at lunch last Thursday, the place was dead. Not a living in soul in the side room or the back room. Maybe 2 customers in the main room. But making a reservation to bring 15 people and maybe $1,000 in lunchtime revenue here the following Thursday is tougher than buying the place. Seriously, I have bought and sold businesses more efficiently than trying to make a reservation at this place! Maybe the people prefer sitting around on their smart phones than serving good, paying customers. So I called O.H.S.O. and had a reservation in a under minute. Sad. I'll change my review in the future if something changes, but nothing I've seen suggests that these people care in the slightest, possibly because of being managed by another restaurant in a different location.
