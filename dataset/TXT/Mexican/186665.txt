Nz44ccUso3nq5S2OlQHNlA Thank you fellow Yelpers! I found this Mexican oasis in the heart of Scarborough thanks to your reviews! 

Didn't know what to expect walking up to their nondescript location but I had faith! We were warmly greeted by the owner with his friendly "hello amigos" and complimentary warm house made nacho chips and salsa to nosh on while we looked over the menu. 

We ordered 2 specials (very popular) the Acapulco and chicken quesadilla. Each meal was fresh and flavourful. The chicken was tender and beef chimichanga had a nice lite spicy kick to it. Well definitely be back soon!!
