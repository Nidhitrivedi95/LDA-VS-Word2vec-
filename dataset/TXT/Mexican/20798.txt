2CNaSduqZIsCRuNvdO_TAQ I eat at Chipotle typically twice a week.  However I will not be returning to this location.  My order somehow is wrong every single time I come.  This is not a once or even twice mistake.  I've tried ordering different things, trying different times of day etc. Somehow the staff seems to always mess it up. Frankly it is worth the extra drive to go to a different location.
