DaVTuhzi6EgWStb2eAjNjA I eat a lot of Mexican food but I haven't felt the kind of elation I'm currently feeling after a meal in a long time. We were brought two margaritas based off of a vague order and were so happy with both of them. The guacamole and the salsas were fantastic. My boyfriend and I both ordered seafood and I'm feeling pleasantly plump and satisfied in a way that is unusually foreign. The vibe was wonderfully mellow for a Friday night. Joy. Total joy.
