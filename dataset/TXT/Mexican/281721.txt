XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg I came to Las Vegas for business and stayed in Caesar's Palace.  Before leaving I really wanted to try a restaurant started by a famous chef so we decided to go to Mesa Grill, which was conveniently located in our hotel.

Everyone was incredibly polite upon our arrival and our server was excellent.  I started with a cactus pear margarita which was amazing.  For dinner I had the Pork Tenderloin, which I can't stop thinking about!  It came with a tamale as well and in all honesty the dish was so big I could have split that along with an appetizer with another and have been perfectly satisfied.

For dinner we had a chocolate cake, which I split with my three other friends.  The cake had a delicious caramel tasting sauce, which I couldn't not get enough of.  Everything was absolutely perfect and I'd definitely come back for more.

Good job Bobby Flay!
