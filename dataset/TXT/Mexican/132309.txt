ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA I can't believe that I have never written a review for this place. I've been coming here since they opened. The service is always great. The margaritas are always great. They have several choices and I've tried a few and I'm never disappointed. I ALWAYS have the queso fundido as an appetizer. Damn, it is always so good. For my entree, I never stray away from the pollo al horno. It is sooooooooo good. Other people that I go there with have had different items on the menu and everyone always loves the food. I don't think it is pricey at all. The food isn't exactly your typical Mexican food experience, but is my "go to place" when someone suggests Mexican food. I love it.
