XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Good service but a few problems during our meal. First impressions matter. Our party of seven was seated in a timely manner. When our main courses arrived one of our guests was not served. Being polite we waited 10 minutes for our remaining guest to receive her dinner. Of course all of our dinners got cold while waiting.  Our waiter saw us waiting and did not seem to care.

I ordered a steak. I was told this restaurant was known for great steaks. What I received was a piece of meat so tough and tasteless it was beyond poor. It was so hard to chew I only ate part of it. At no time did the waiter inquire if our food was satisfactory because, had he done so, I would have made my dissatisfaction clear.

As I said this was my first visit and I don't plan to return. Maybe it was just an anomaly for us, but all seven guests at our table unanimously expressed dissatisfaction.
