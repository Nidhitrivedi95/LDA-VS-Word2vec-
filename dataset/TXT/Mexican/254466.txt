V94gk_Vx0Ot623UGHG6PrA My husband and I went for the first time last weekend and we were pleased. He ordered a shrimp burrito and I a taco salad. He ate everything on his plate and I could only eat half my salad because it was huge. We both ordered margaritas. Mine was blended and didn't seem to have any alcohol and his was on the rocks and it definitely had alcohol. We had a great local date night. The taco salad is crave-able   We will go back.
