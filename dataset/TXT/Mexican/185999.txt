nwHd2MbIGz0SNG8GpFjekw My wife and I have driven past this place on countless occasions thinking it was just your typical 'hole-in-the-wall' Mexican restaurant. It's not!!! The food is incredible, especially the tacos al pastor! I lived in Mexico City for two years and have struggled to find good Mexican tacos here in Phoenix. Although the al pastor tacos don't have the slice of pineapple on top like they do in DF, they definitely have everything else. Even the tortillas tasted amazing! My wife got the smothered burrito which was also great. 

The atmosphere is nice albeit it was rather crowded when we went on a Friday night. The restaurant is clean, the service fast, and the food inexpensive. We're definitely coming back!
