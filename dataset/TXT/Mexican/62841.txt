aXRrMXXoAN7lawHICgmsxw This place is really good. There are not a lot of menu options but everything on the menu is done exceptionally well. I got the Roro Burger with fries and the avo crema (avocado crema). The burger comes on an english muffin and it is the perfect vessel to carry the burger and have it soak up all the meat juices. The fries are well seasoned with a pleasant kick and the avo creama, which is similar to ranch, is a perfect dipping sauce for the fries. We sat outside and they had the misters on to keep us cool. The wait staff is really kind and friendly. I was overall really impressed with the establishment and will def. be back to try their dessert menu out. There is nothing that i could think of that could improve upon which is rare! Fine job!!!
