i-Bu8g-y6fuLFAmLsGo0GQ Best burritos in Pickering. I love that they put guacamole on your burrito without an extra charge! Different types of toppings, one being noodles! They also have selection meats, different types of chicken, fish, shrimps and others. 

I have a huge appetite so their regular size is good for me. I feel full and satisfied and happy !!! They have great vegetarian options as well, like sweet potatoes not like other places where the veg option is the regular burrito sans the meat for practically the same price! 

The price of burritos is around $10 bucks, but its money well spent! More of a take out place, not a sit in joint. The place is quite small but the burritos are grande!
