5cbsjFtrntUAeUx51FaFTg We were visiting Vegas from San Francisco, we were looking for a place to eat lunch on our way from The Strip to Red Rock Canyon, we chose Agave, and we loved it. It's a beautiful restaurant; a lot of care has clearly been put into decorating it both inside and out. I loved the artwork, the metal and wood fixtures, the various types of lights hanging from the ceiling, the brightly painted walls.

Our waiter brought chips and salsa to start, and these were head and shoulders above what you get at many Mexican restaurants. The chips were warm, thick, and sprinkled with some kind of large-grain salt, and there were three small bowls of salsa to choose from, presented on an iron serving apparatus. J. and I both ordered taco platters, and we both had chicken and grilled fish versions, and for our third tacos, she had carne asada, and I had birria (goat). Outstanding! Flavorful meat, fresh tortillas. My margarita was tasty enough, but it wasn't as huge as it looked in its jumbo-sized glass -- there was a lot of ice. Still, a nice way to cool off on a hot day.

If you're ever in Summerlin, NV, and craving delicious nuevo Mexican food, hit Agave.
