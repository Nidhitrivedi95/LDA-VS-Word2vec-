DyOzNIeXUksPNLXYHnB-oQ Stopped by for lunch today and had the best nachos of my life. I paid $7 for a plate of nachos that came on a plate the size of a large pizza. It was MASSIVE. I got them with shredded chicken (included in the price) and they were incredible. 
They have so many delicious looking options and I can't wait to go back and try what else they have to offer. This place definitely lives up to the hype
