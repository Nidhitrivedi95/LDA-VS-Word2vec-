KjV_68oLLSpqR96VnV68tw One of the best fast food Mexican food places that I've been to. What I love about it is the fact they have a drive thru that is open 24/7. My favorite here is the Carne Asada fries. Now I've tried other places in California and in Henderson and none of them come close to how flavorful, as well as how packed of a container you will get for the money. Best bang for your buck. Will always come here to get my carne asada fix.
