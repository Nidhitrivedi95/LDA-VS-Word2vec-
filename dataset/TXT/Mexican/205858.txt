pyeoyouJWxxcwzfugfessQ Came here on a whim for our anniversary. It wasn't too bad, but also not the best either. For myself and my husband we ordered 6 street tacos, one margarita, and one Mexican corn street nachos. It was enough for the two of us. The nachos were really good but I wish they had put some spice on them (jalapenos, or spicy salsa on the side). If you go, I highly recommend you try them. I was, however, disappointed in the tacos. We got two of each to share - carne asada, chicken tinga, and the carnitas taco. The carne asada was decent, but kind of fatty (like another reviewer said) - but was my favorite of the three (but I am really partial to carne asada anything so I may be biased). The chicken tinga didn't seem to have a lot of flavor to me; again, maybe some spice. The carnitas were my husband's favorite, and I have to agree that the carnitas meat was very good - but the toppings they put on the taco were very sour in flavor, and they put A LOT of sauce on everything but especially the carnitas. I kind of wish they would put less sauce, or offer the sauces on the side. Maybe that is something that could be requested.

It is a bar atmosphere, as expected, but the prices were higher than anticipated at a bar. We came on taco Tuesday and our bill was still $40 for one drink, six tacos, and a nacho so I think that is a bit over priced for a bar-like restaurant. 

Overall I personally won't go out of my way to come here again but it's not been scratched off my list if ever in the area again. The nachos were well worth it and I guess I could always ask for some Cholula sauce to put on top of them. If you can manage to get here during happy hour they are only $5.
