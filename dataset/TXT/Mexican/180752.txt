N7Gkwbfs4sDikX4qHg_fGQ Well it's okay. Not great. Just okay. I haven't been back, so I guess, I didn't care too much for the place. I've had better Tex-Mex off the food trucks lately. However, my companions enjoyed, so I say could just be me. I expect a higher quality and freshness having eaten Tex-Mex in Texas, Arizona, and California. Tex-Mex in New Mexico is gross and different by the way. A few good restaurants. Wild boar is on every menu it seems. Yuk. So, I suppose their cheese enchiladas compared to wild boar meat is good!
