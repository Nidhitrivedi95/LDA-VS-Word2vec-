JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg Ab-so-lutely un-believable! I know what you're thinking...it's Mexican food, how good can it be? Growing up in Southern California, I've had more Mexican food than a small army, and believe me...this cannot be beat. Literally the best Carne Asada taco I've ever eaten. I had the enchiladas (red) with pinto beans and rice. It was ALL on point. Nothing made me want to stop eating....except having no room left. Also, I'm more of a product guy than a service guy, but Lindsey our server was awesome! I make special requests and substitutions just about everywhere I go, and I'm very particular, but she didn't disappoint. Everything came out from the kitchen hot and correct...my two favorite ways to have food. Thanks Lindsey! I'm thinking about getting something to go and how it will be possible to heat it up from my hotel room....blow dryer? 

IF YOU DON'T COME HERE ONCE IN YOUR LIFE, YOU'RE MISSING OUT.
