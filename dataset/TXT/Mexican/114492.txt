GGecutXeoEVlYKoxVo2WPA I was introduced to this place by an ex and I have to say it's the nicest thing she ever did for me. The menu here is about what you would expect from Mexican fast food but the quality and taste of their food is consistently above most places you will find in the valley even including full service restaurants. The complimentary chips and full salsa bar are nice and if you go in the afternoon they have their liquor license.
