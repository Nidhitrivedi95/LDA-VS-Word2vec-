m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw Beautiful atmosphere food not bad but so not worth high price tag. I know this is in Downtown Summerlin where rent is high but... 90% of meals are over 15.00 Ridiculous! Two tables came in reviewed menu and I heard them also talking about the high prices. The lowest thing is a plain burrito at 13.95.  So - they started sending out coupons 2 for 1 for dinners but there's s catch.. you have to order two drinks. Watch it a simple soda is 3.75 each! Lol so u really get 8.50 off of highly expensive meals. Really only 50% off your second meal. 

Lower ur prices your not that great of food  and I was around people not coming back again.
