K-uQkfSUTwu5LIwPB4b_vg This place was a Pleasent Surprise. We had an outstanding Waiter. Portions were decent and food was amazing and nicely plated. $$$ is accurate. We ate off a limited lunch menu which had a nice variety of choices and was outstanding to eat. Lots of well fused together flavors. I had the Marinated Skirt Steak Tacos garnished with Avocado slices and we ordered the table side guacamole. Must have that!  My wife had the Chicken and Ham-hock Tostada. Both excellent. Will go back.
