gsCOklDm1pbx3Tzo3W-mtw Froze today cause we got there right after they opened & no heat yet!!!! Talked  to the waiter about it being freezing & he didn't understand what i was saying. Chips tasted slightly rancid which is not the norm...I hate when the waiter can't understand a word you say to him... Helllllloooo, this is America not Mexico, I want the wait staff to understand me & speak English to me!!!!!
