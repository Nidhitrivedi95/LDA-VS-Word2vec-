G_mqw9nNYDFkwtCe5Jd8QA I don't know if the people who have reviewed this place are actually friends/family members of the owners .... I just don't understand why my experience was so different than the other 94 reviews I read that brought me here in the first place. I spent $30 for two people. This included 4 street tacos (so incredibly tiny, two should truly be one), two tostada ceviche, and 1 Mexican sushi roll (each $9.99).

I enjoyed the tostada, should have just ordered 3 of them and called it a day. It wasn't the best but it was adequate for the price or maybe just so much more enjoyable then the other items we selected.

The sushi Mexican roll, although very creative, tasted like a grease roll and I was not a fan despite all the raving reviews. It isn't sushi at all. It is a roll but they should really call it something else. I was expecting sushi ... that was not sushi. The tacos were raved about in other reviews, I wasn't impressed. The place is a semi bad area of town, that doesn't bother me, its a walk up to counter and order, that doesn't bother me ... it was just the food that bothered me. 

I tried it once, won't be back. It just wasn't satisfying. I am the first person to praise any little non-commercialized business but just not this place.
