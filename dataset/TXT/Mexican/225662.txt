RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg I had 2 al pastor and 2 Asada tacos with everything on both  and sadly to say they were good but not the best tacos of my life. The Asada was really salty. I really liked the pina colada drink. Maybe if I spoke Spanish and knew the taco secrets it would have been better. I saw some people had pineapple on their al pastor. Not sure if you say something to order it like that. 
The best tacos of my life are still in East Oakland Cali.
