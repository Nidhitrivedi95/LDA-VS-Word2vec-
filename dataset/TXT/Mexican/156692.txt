KGqvUQQA4c9GJpi5-znsew Me and my boyfriend have come here a few times for late dinners, to grab burritos and they were good! I'm only giving this two stars because of this last experience. I had ordered a bean and cheese with potatoes and pico (which I have ordered before so I know what I should be expecting) and got a burrito FILLED with onions. So we took it back, they have a sign that literally says "bring food back within 24 hours for a refund" and the lady was so rude saying "why didn't you get the pico on the side. this is the LAST time." Implying that this was the last time she'll remake a burrito for us. Instead of realizing something wasn't right and apologizing decided to give us attitude and a rude response to the issue.
