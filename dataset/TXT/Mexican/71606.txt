C2BR0TjNacoNzItPLUHTAA Delicious. I have been looking for a good fish taco place for years. As a Seattle native, I am picky, and getting fish at restaurants in a land locked state always gives me the heebies unless I go to a 5 star restaurant. This little joint opened up right down the road from my house and lemme tell you, so worth it. First off, the gentleman working behind the counter was awesome. Seriously, this guy loves his job and it is so apparent. He asked if it was my first time then went through all the ingredients in their tacos, what makes them special, and recommendations. Didn't even sound canned, just authentic. I ended up getting the fish tacos (two tacos, so massive) and the seafood chowder. Both unbelievably delicious. Coconuts gets this pacific northwesterner's stamp of approval. I am a customer for life, thanks guys for such a great experience.
