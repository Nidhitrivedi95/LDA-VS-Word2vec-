78hGCrQ6wLA2yh8zMywnmw So I decided to give it a try since I live down the street. I've had friends who told me the first is dry. I first got the cajun and it was so tough so then I got grilled fish and once again extremely overcooked and dry. I ended up getting tofu and veggies and literally there was 6 pieces of cubed tofu and it lacked flavor. The only reason I'm giving two stars is the service and the white beans were good. 

Oh if you go after 9 pm and say your in the industry is 30% off. 

PROS: white beans and service
CONS: Everything but the beans
