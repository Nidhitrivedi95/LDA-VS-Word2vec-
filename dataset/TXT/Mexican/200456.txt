pdTYUCGkYz35utxPyUMoag At Yonge/Ellington...great location but that's where it ended for me. There are 2 different sections of this location. The upper restaurants area & the lower more bar-like area. We were in the bar area. 

To start with the place wasn't busy but the service was very slow. We didn't have a server per-say but we're served by several people. The food was only ok but far from great. I ordered the Chorizo Sausage Quesadilla. It was good but small with limited taste. The Nachos with 3 dips (guacamole/corn/salsa) was ok but way over priced at almost $16.00! The service in general was not good. No plates, I had to get up to get my own napkins & almost zero check back. There's other Mexican restaurants in the city that are way better...go there! I won't go back here.
