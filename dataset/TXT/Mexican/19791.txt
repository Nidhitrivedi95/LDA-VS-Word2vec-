1YyZKh-R8aDvySArk-hCpg Came at 6:45pm on a Friday night & they were CLOSED!  Hope to try it, but closing when all are off work... to be continued.

OKAY, we went back to try it, got a little of everything and honestly it wasn't that good.  I was sad that there was hardly any filling in any of the tamales. Oh well, we won't go back (which makes me sad because I love to support the mom and pop shops!)
