Qb1tuREKTsyVKO6DiDQXgg For the price, this restaurant/cantina has pretty tasty mexican food! Red and Green burritos are very good! The servers are always very accomidating and pleasant. Much better than Top Shelf. Awesome happy hour. Great energy with fun customers! Chips need to be upgraded and fresh though. Will continue to come back.
