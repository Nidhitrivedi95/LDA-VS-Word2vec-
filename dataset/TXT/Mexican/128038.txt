hy1TkGNnDuHfUHf_7kUqRw The other night I ordered by phone, and got EVERYTHING WRONG! I asked for a shredded beef burrito with cheese inside and enchilada style, wrong, I asked for a sope with adobada on top, wrong, I asked for a plain churro, wrong.  The only thing I like about it, is that it has a drive-thru.
