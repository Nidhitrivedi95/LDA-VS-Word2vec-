iBPSrhDr7IlfMywxCIp-wA This location needs to get it together. I can't tell you how many times I've ordered food to go and the order is completely messed up. Shame on me for giving this spot numerous chances. I've also noted this place needs to keep on top of cleaning and sanitary measures. I continue to notice AND tell employees that the ice tea dispensers seem to always have no lids. Tonight I politely reminded them of how unsanitary it is...her response, "Oh, we forget to put lids on."
