2g4ZTD3ePNSbDAvh6qAOKQ I ordered a plate of chilaquilles and they were okay the chips had a taste similar to pan dulce. It kind of ruined my meal but my son got a torta and it was really good the meat was lean and fatty pieces. I would return but order something that doesn't include tortillas chips.
