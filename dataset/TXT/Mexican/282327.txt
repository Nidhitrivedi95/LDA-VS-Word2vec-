XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Bobby Flay ROCKS.  I had the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin, with bourbon ancho chile sauce and sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter, which was AWESOME.  This entree also comes with another side, which rotates.  When I first had it, the dinner came with roasted kernel corn with Cojita cheese and a squeeze of lime.  It all was so, soo good. 

All the food is fantastic.  Great atmosphere.  It's a little expensive, and "proper dress" is required.  (Ex -  they made me remove my baseball cap, or I wouldn't be seated.)
