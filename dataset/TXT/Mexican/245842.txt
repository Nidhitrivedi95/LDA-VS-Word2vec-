tstimHoMcYbkSC4eBA1wEg I am sooooooo happy I finally stopped in here. What a true little gem in this area. I had a lunch date with my parents today and my dad has been craving Mexican food so I thought this was the perfect opportunity to give it a try. So in my semi conscious food coma I am going to write this review the best I can. Ha! 

Its a tiny restaurant that packs a huge punch with flavors. I think I counted eight tables so if you plan to come with a larger party call in advance to make sure there is space. When I walked in the first thing  I noticed was the delicious combinations of smells. On top of the yummy Mexican spices it is also attached to a bakery so definitely stop in there afterwards. 

We were greeting by a friendly waitress who took our drink orders immediately and then promptly brought out hot crispy tortillas and salsa. The salsa was sooooo yummy. I actually took an extra order to go. 

My dad had the chile verde with corn tortillas, my mom ordered the chile relleno, and I had a cup of albondigas soup along with the enchiladas verdes.  Everything was amazing! Both my parents cleaned the plate! I have honestly never seen them do that before haha! The sauce on my enchiladas was so tasty and it was packed with moist perfectly spiced chicken. I took multiple bites of my parents food and it was just as good. We all liked it so much we plan to come back here very soon. 

Not only was it delicious but it's easy on the wallet. Our bill was only $42 and that included beer and soft drinks. That's pretty good for 3 people. 

Don't let the area or the size of the place scare you. Stop in and give it a try.
