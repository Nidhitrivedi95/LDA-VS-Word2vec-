hisaMvsxMzo08xigPIwXiA We came In for lunch and decided to order dinner entres. They just looked so good...Seafood was cooked just right and flavors are great. Prices are reasonable for seafood and the food came out quick. The courtesy chips and salsa were awesome. service were good and friendly. Will be back to try more dishes.
