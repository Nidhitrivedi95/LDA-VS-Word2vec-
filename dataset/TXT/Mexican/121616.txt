h8XdexOcJlfLOwXIDtyalg In general I prefer costa vida over cafe rio, but this location is particularly bad. I've been here about 4 or 5 times since they opened because it's closer to home than costa vida. The food is not fresh, and the ingredients are messy and disorganized.  Today I got a tostada and chips and queso. The tostada itself, the chips and the tortilla strips were all stale and ruined each dish. The pork was flavorless and fatty. The queso at this location has been out of stock half of my visits, and the other half the consistency has been off. Blah not coming back to this location. 2 stars for friendly service.
