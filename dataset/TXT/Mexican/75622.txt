CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q This place is always packed. Their tacos are the best what do we all expect? I'll will wait in line for the best tacos in Vegas. Everyone will! And all of us do! We enjoy this place and their food. 5 stars for the employees that work here. They work hard all day and night. You guys rock! I know what it feels like to have a restaurant full of customers waiting in line for food. Overwhelming at times. They make it look like a piece of cake. Good job guys! I enjoy the food every time. I was born and raised in Vegas. Any local knows that this is the spot!
