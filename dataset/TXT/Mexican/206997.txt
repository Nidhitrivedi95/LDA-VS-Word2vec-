q50PTYB15EO2jEwgv-9vrA First time visiting, and the experience was HORRIBLE. My son & I each had an entree and a soda. Service was extremely slow. When the waiter brought over the bill, it was over $50!!!! He had entered drinks for another table to my check. I actually had to argue to have the charge taken off!  Later, both my son & I got sick. Never again.
From now on, we stick to Don Ramon.
