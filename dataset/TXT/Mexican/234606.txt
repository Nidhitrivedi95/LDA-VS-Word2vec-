svdEhLmNmpVaIv1WLtoOvQ This place is really good. One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas. The service is really good. Everyone is very attentive and experienced. We were served by Orlando. It was incredible how knowledgeable he was when it came to vegan/gluten free food. He helped us a lot with our choices and was very educated and polite. I highly recommend this place if you want to eat very tasteful Mexican food (except on Tuesday when they have a DJ playing and its usually packed).
