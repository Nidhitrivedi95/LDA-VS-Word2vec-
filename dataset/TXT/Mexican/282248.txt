XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Me and hubby decided last minute on a Saturday night to find a place on the strip to have dinner and Mesa Grill was our pick.  We've been here one other time but that was years ago. Our dinner tonight was excellent, as was our service. Deanna was extremely helpful and provided us with great customer service. 

Now on to the important stuff.......the food. No complaints whatsoever. We had the shrimp tamale and bbq duck, ribeye and 16 spice chicken and the plantain tamale and brussel sprouts. EVERYTHING was perfectly amazing. Can't wait to visit again.
