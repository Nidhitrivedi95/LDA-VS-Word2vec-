WpI5MZC3XzlTpcUOKXzCbA I'll start off by saying I used to love this place. I would come in here with people late at night all the time because it was walking distance. 
Then they changed bartenders or management a couple years ago and wow, what a difference. 
I told a few people how they would ignore me and it seemed like they would go out of their way to not help me. Nobody believed me until I went with someone that was a regular there (that they always treated well). He witnessed first hand how I was intentionally ignored, particularly when there were only a few other people there. I never complain or act rude so it was very odd and something I've never experienced before. 
I haven't been there in a long time now and don't plan on going back.
