PgdQrTSOX132EgNj8VPNlg All I can say about Mad Mex is WOW! The atmosphere was right up my alley, music was perfect and the service was attentive and visually pleasing. Then came the food! Portions are more than enough and the flavor is out of this world! It is an hour drive from my house and I could justify the drive for this any day of the week. Mad Mex, you just blew my mind!!
