Got there around 1AM and the place was still very much alive with quite a few people from the industry checking the place. It still smells very much new but given the traffic that certainly won't be the case for long. 
The place is very much focused on Mezcal. There are tons of it and the staff was very knowledgeable. Tried one smoky and chilly one which was pretty awesome and certainly changed my perception of the liquid. Had it with some spicy round chips that were just a good excuse to sample some more Mezcal. If you're not into this there are also other spirits and you will find great whiskies including some cool new Canadian whiskies like Gooderham & Worts and Lot 40. 
The patio was also open and will certainly be a great destination in Kensington. The inside decor is very nice and stays authentic. 
Will most definitely be back to check the food options.
