erx8tQ0Wdc5YM0FddaKqKA Would not come back. 

Drinks: I ordered the "Blast Furnace" margarita since I am a baby and only drink sweet low alcohol mixed drinks. Well this was delicious and sweet but had not a DROP of tequila in it, though it's supposed to be a tequila mixed drink... at a restaurant that calls itself a "tequila bar". BF had a beer and had no complaints.

Dining: We were not offered or given water, and we had a sit down meal at a booth! Only given a single flimsy paper napkin each, and this is a place that serves tacos which are obviously a bit messy to eat. My boyfriend liked the tacos but went through the sole napkin in 3 seconds. He did note that the lamb was a little tough. I got the yucca fries without chorizo (as this menu does not have a single vegetarian option...not even a vegetarian salad available, like wtf). The fries were served in a little bucket thing lined with paper. However these fries are drizzled with cheese sauce which immediately soaked through the paper lining and I spent the whole time trying not to eat shredded paper. Not to mention, there was practically no cheese sauce on it, which was a shame because it was the only flavorful part of the dish. 

Overall okay flavors but poorly executed delivery. They need to get the basics down (give us water, napkins, and alcohol in our mixed drinks) before I'd ever come back.
