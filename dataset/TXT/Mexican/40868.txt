6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA I have been here twice and only to the Bar Area. 

The bartenders know their drinks and you are offered Chips & Salsa which are warm and amazing. The chips are dusted with some seasoning and you get a chipotle based salsa.
The menu has many options and their table side guacamole is very good and fresh - get it if you can. The only downside is that they cannot make my favorite drink is a Michelada (also known as a Red Beer) and consist of a Mexican beer, lime, spices and Clamato and salted glass . For some reason they don't carry Clamato and I usually order it with a bloody mix instead which is my that great but will do. They also don't have any Hefeweizen at all which is odd but this is the reason for my 4 stars - I'm limited on my favorite drink selections
