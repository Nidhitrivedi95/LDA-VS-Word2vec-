bMSiHjs2fbKbBNPyuTwhHA I'm a big fan of Coastal Tacos! Why?

- It's open late
- Coolest patio CLE has to offer, you literally feel like you're on vacay.
- Delicious tacos. The steak & shrimp are my go-to. $2 tacos on Taco Tuesday, chya!
- My friend had the burger last night and she said it was phenomenal.
- Cute bartenders. ;-)
- Giant Jenga!
- Ping Pong Tables.
- On Sundays they have steel drums...and they play some damn good tunes.
- $5 tasty cocktails during happy hour.
- The bar wraps around inside & out.
- The decor is badass and the servers seem pretty friendly.
