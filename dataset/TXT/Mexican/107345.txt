fqMAnoS2sTokz6lqBSmoCw Eh... being from Southern California, I can say that a lot more needs to happen to claim SoCal here. Tacos lacked flavor. The fish taco was over-battered.  If you are mentioning California, you must master a fish taco or not have it on the menu. Pastor was very dry. Guacamole was sub par, again... a CA staple. Hope this gets better... I was so hoping for a taste of home. Ambience is great; may be a fabulous spot for drinks.  I'd head to Comida, Babalu, or Sabor instead. I hope it gets better!!!
