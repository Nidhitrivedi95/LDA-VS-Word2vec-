NOfbzTpQ7hrt6ZbJVeXUUw After an early Saturday full of shopping, we were looking for snacks and refreshments STAT. We stumbled upon Loco Cantina and knew that is exactly where we needed to be. 

We sat at the bar and ordered a shrimp taco, chips and salsa, a house margarita, and a modelo on tap. The bf thoroughly the taco and the house margarita was good enough to keep drinking!

We look forward to going back the next time we are in Vegas. Especially to try the nachos-- they look out of the world!
