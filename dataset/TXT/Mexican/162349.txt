L2iT7pipc455Tgpbo35_mw The worst!  I ate here a lot when it was Chronic Taco and had great service and food.  We had to wait 45 minutes for our meal and we were table checked one time.   I ordered what they called Ceviche, that was gazpacho that they served with ONE piece of shrimp!  Too many places on Mill Ave. to find a better dining experience than to waste my time and money here.
