n_n0aT_W10GOPglpzH5atg I can honestly say I have never had worst customer service in my life. There was only one cashier, working drive-through and counter, no lie, I waited eight minutes for her to get to me. When I finally got my tacos, there was about three pieces of chicken in there and I'm pretty sure there was no meat in the regular taco. I do not suggest going here.
