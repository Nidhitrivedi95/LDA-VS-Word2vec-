gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw Wow...amazing experience.  The food was great and service was awesome.   Had the guacamole dip and tuna appetizer and would recommend both highly.  Also would recommend the halibut and Brazilian steak.  Had sides of macaroni and cheese, jasmine rice and plantain. All were great.  Topped with the churro and Marquesa for dessert.   A must visit when in Vegas.  Fun and cool atmosphere.
