zHAR8MmCbjrkNnLGm1ozEQ Go now while the gettins good.  Robertos style menu but higher quality because it's new.

Chicken fajitas was breast meat and cooked well meaning the peppers and onions that came with it were crunchy and cooked well without being soggy and chicken was juicy.  No beans with this combo, rice lacked any fresh veggies as is typical with these quickie mex joints but was excellent in taste and texture and didnt taste like day old stanky rice.  Tortillas were bomb, all food fresh, place clean.

best part of the meal was the green sauce at the salsa bar.  def had a mild heat and prolly a combo of fresh avo and/or sour cream for a nice smooth consistency instead of watery robertos etal. texture.

Good job rivas #4.  glad i stumbled in here since i was at the dq and couldnt get served because a 400 lb behemouth was arguing for over 5 minutes about the consistency of her ice cream.
