k-drEjxKmfqllwfY90STfA The new Cantina location looks fantastic! The hubs and I set out for lunch on Sunday and even though we frequent the stonecrest location, we wanted to see what this one was all about. The food is consistently good and the atmosphere is top notch for a local Tex-Mex joint. We will cut our server some needed slack as it seems he was hectic and busy. Keep up the good work Cantina.
