woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ Tako lives up to the hype. 

Probably my second favorite place in Pittsburgh, behind Gaucho.

I had an order of the Korean Tacos, which were delicious. They had a nice little kick to 'em and were loaded with fresh ingredients. Two of these guys had me feeling pretty full. 

Anything you order will be fantastic, but definitely order TWO orders of the papas bravas... you will not want to share with your SO, date, friends, nor family. Who knew potatoes could be so good?
