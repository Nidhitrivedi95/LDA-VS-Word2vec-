IghwtXL8ZgK2dEL62Pzhrw One of my new favorite spots for street tacos, right after Backyard tacos. However, I feel like this is more comparable to the tacos by Charlie's.

I was excited when I drove up to this location. It's always a good sign when there's a line for food. It's even a better sign when's there's the al pastor is actually slow kicked on the rotating skewer machine - that just makes my mouth watery already.

From least to favorite, i tried the chorizo, carne asada, and al pastor. I just planned out didn't like the chorizo - I thought it was over cooked. The carne Adams was good, but not the best. The al pastor was spot on! It's marinated very well and cooked very well. It's not soggy or drenched in oil but yet not dry. 

Also, loved the salsa here - very flavorful. You can also ask for grilled onions; grilled onions will always win some extra brownie points with me. Hot hats was smooth and milky with good amount of sweetness and spices - none of that chalky powdery texture.

Best of all their prices are good!
