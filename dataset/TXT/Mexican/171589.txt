First the chips and hot sauce were awesome. Chips were crispy and thicker than normal which made them unique. Everyone ordered tacos or combo plates. No complaints. I order sampler appetizer 22$. It had two small quesadilla sections with shrimp. These were GREAT. Had two taquitos that were not very crispy. Nachos were ok. Velveeta type cheese but a small tiny portion. A chicken tamale that was good and quacomole that was standard. Most of everyone's food was look warm. Hence star missing. I find Luke warm food very aggravating and possibly unsafe. This needs to be addressed by management. This was a concern. All in all the food was good. Probably best place to eat while inside the Luxor.
