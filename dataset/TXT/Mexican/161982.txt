l0Gop1Hu8XJYpHHCpvG6SA Since living nearby I decided to stop by to try the food. Since moving to Las Vegas from NorCal I have been looking for my go to Mexican restaurant.  This place is good. The food is somewhat tasty but the price is a bit high for my liking. It may be the location that makes the prices higher but I if i'm spending a pretty penny on the food then I better be getting a good amount of meat in my burrito. Salsas are good, burrito is ok but needs more flavor and meat. I do wish they had a salsa bar with chips, radishes, pickled carrots and jalapeños and an self serve soda machine with unlimited drinks. (Kinda like El Pollo Loco) Overall, the place has authentic Mexican tasting food which I appreciate.
