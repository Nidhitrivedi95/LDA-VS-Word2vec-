sDyTfafJfhb_5ewii6TEjg Visited this place for a snack prior to watching a movie - and it was the ABSOLUTE WORST!

Meat seemed like it has been sitting there for days.  Sour cream had a funky taste. Chips were not fresh.

Now add a couple of miserable employees and you got the perfect recipe for disaster.

WILL NEVER RETURN. I also hope they close and something else would open up
