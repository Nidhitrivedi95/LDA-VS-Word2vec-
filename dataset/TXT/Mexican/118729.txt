gRdBkmXdRqUzDMkcMtt7rQ my wife and i decided to try a different taco shop and ordered the milanesa torta it was very dry and chewy and the chicken quesadilla had hardly any chicken in it and no cheese more tortilla than anything...they have no flavor quality of meat is terrible and the portion they put in there meals is Not worth 16 dollars could have gone elsewhere and got more for my money up the road at Robertos taco shop where we usually go for our mexican plates will not be coming back, don't recommend it.
