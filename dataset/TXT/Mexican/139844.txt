J5ebC7fKqrSF8KuS8d6hgw Sierra Bonita has an absolutely killer happy hour.  You can get yourself  an amazingly strong Pomegranate margarita and a sampling of some of the tastiest (and cheapest) appetizers around town.  The scallops and bacon wrapped shrimp and divine, and the tamale is one of the best in the valley.  

The restaurant has a great dark and cozy feel... perfect for a date night out.  The outdoor patio is well shaded, and is one of my favorite spots to sit.  They also have a couple of fantastic private rooms on the lower level, if you need that kind of thing.

Though this is a frequent happy hour stop for me, I haven't actually had dinner there... I should probably check out the main menu and enjoy Sierra Bonita in all its glory!
