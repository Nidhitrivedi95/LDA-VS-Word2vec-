7F0ccIsqZSaqi1r7SB4nfQ I just finished pork belly tacos...haven't finished my meal...had to tell the world.  If you're somewhere right now and you're eating something other than tio's pork belly tacos you need to re-evaluate your priorities in life.  Unless you're a vegan, in which case you still need to re-evaluate your priorities in life, but for different reasons.
