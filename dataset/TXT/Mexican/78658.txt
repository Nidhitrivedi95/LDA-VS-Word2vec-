cr84hpeFeas6N6VGV7Iu3A I'm trying to think of something that stood out to me about this place but nothing really did. I had the enchiladas Verde. They were okay. The portion size was on the small side for what I expect in a Mexican restaurant. The service was great but the food just fell flat. Everything seemed to be lacking the outstanding flavor I expect in Mexican cuisine. The free queso was worth a try but I probably won't be back, sadly. I've been spoiled by the authentic Mexican restaurants in the area with better prices, bigger flavor, and larger portions. 

BUT - if you decide to head to Three Amigos, definitely get a glass of Horchata. It was my favorite thing I had.
