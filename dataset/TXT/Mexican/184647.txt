Ns20WGWn6s6niKAGIQB4UQ Recently I had lunch at Crescent Ballroom on a work trip to Phoenix. I would recommend this restaurant as an inexpensive, trendy Mexican option in Downtown Phoenix.

The restaurant has an adaptive reuse warehouse vibe with lots of wood, metals and glass. Very urban and trendy looking.

Pros:
I ordered three tacos, 1 shredded chicken, 1 barbacoa and 1 blackened tilapia. All 3 tacos were delicious and I was very happy with my order. The ingredients (avocado, cilantro, tomato, cabbage) were fresh, and the presentation of the food was good. I personally liked the barbacoa taco the most, had a little spicy kick.

Cons:
Service was slow and our waitress seemed disengaged. There was a 20 minute lag between members of our party receiving their main course lunch orders. I know there are longer waits at lunch, but it shouldn't take that long to serve tacos.

Overall I enjoyed the food and my dining experience at Crescent Ballroom and would return.
