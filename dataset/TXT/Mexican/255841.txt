veXxt8rGY_RJPpA5QkHT9Q Yeah, no.  We waited and waited for an outside table.  We were finally on our way there and then we ran into some old neighbors.  Said hello, went to our table and someone else took it.  They apologized, you get the next one.  WTH, 20 minutes later there is one and they gave it to someone else.  The old neighbor went to ask for management.  No one knew who manager was.  Then after one hour of losing the first table we had a table.  Problem, cold, sun going down. Nearly dark.  Three kinds of wine.  Really don't you make more money of alcohol?  They are like we are tequilla bar.  Fair enough, i'll do water.  Food not the best.  Freezing cold outside.  You know the hostess is the most important job.  Figure it out.  Won't be back.  Lovely setting out back, if it wasn't 9:00 when we got a table....
