They make a mean margarita and offer all kinds of different flavors including a special of the month. I love their quesadilla. My husband loves their burrito bowls, shrimp tacos and regular burritos. We always enjoy our visit and they have very nice service as well. In the summer time there's an outdoor deck overlooking water that's very nice too.
