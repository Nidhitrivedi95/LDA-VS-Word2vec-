QwAJZuJTo36OAj6DJxz14g Went Saturday with my girlfriend to this place.  What a wonderful experience.  Ashley our waitress was super friendly and went out of her way to make my sandwich just the way I like it (thanks a lot).  The scenery was beautiful and both our lunches were great.  Felt prices were in line with every other place.  Try this place, you won't regret it!!
