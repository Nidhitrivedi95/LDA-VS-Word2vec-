R-sEoZXf37pGzLnid7s6wA This place is awesome! The food here was way beyond my expectations, and thank goodness for that. I can't think of a time I've ever gone into a restaurant with high expectations then had those expectations blown out of the water with pure awesomeness and then thought to myself "that wasn't what I was hoping for".

But onto the review, just to give a heads up the outside does look a bit shady, but the inside was nice and clean. And now that that is out of the way FOOD!!!!
I had the rancho grande and it was very good. Not to mention there was a lot of food. Just as a reference I am 220lbs and saying I can eat can be an understatement, but just eating this combo made me fairly full.

My wife got the green chile pork burrito, and that was also very, and let me stress the VERY on that, good. After trying hers I almost wish I had gotten that instead of my rancho grande. But either way I walked away full and satisfied. To sum it all up on a few lines...

Good food, lots of it, and great price. I recommend going here, I know I'll be back
