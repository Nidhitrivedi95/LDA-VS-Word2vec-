bgOgbr7ocyfYafqUAaR0WA You have not lived until you have their fish tacos! Best place. Loved the old Rancho on College, and this cute little place continues the legacy. Great vibe, a few tables if you want to eat in, amazing prices (that include tax!) Plus the best guac ever that they make in house. Get the fish tacos- you won't regret it!
