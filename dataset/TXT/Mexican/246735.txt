TXjg3qtm6gjlbP8Iwsm4lQ Chipotle is good because of the food as we all know... I would like to particularly review the service of this chipotle compared to others. When I use to come in here, the old manager was friendly, happy to admit mistakes, and would even reconcile things like having to wait because they hadn't cooked meat fast enough (he would give me a bag of chips or a soda cup, etc). When I went in last month around 4pm and it was slow, there were 3 people in line, I went up to the counter and started ordering my burrito, all of a sudden the lady slaps a big scoop of sour cream on my burrito without me asking for it. Now I am lactose intolerance and know people make mistakes so I simply said "hey sorry I didn't ask for that and am allergic." I proceeded to get a response from whom I later found out was the manager saying "well what do you want me to do remake the whole thing?" I proceeded with I hate to do that to you but I didn't ask for it and can't eat it with the sour cream. This was responded to a grunt as the woman threw the burrito in the trashcan and gave me an attitude to make me feel guilty as she remade my burrito. I have never been so turned off by customer service like that and to later find out she is the manager there is absolutely appalling. In addition I have several friends that have mentioned poor experiences with this staff. 

I HAVEN'T RETURNED SINCE! Although I still go to chipotle as I think it is a great company and wonderful food, I will never be returning to that location and highly recommend against supporting customer service like that...
