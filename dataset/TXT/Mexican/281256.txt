XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg I had my expectations set so high for this place. Amongst all the food network stars Bobby flat stands out to me because he concentrates more on flavor than fat and meat, like the others do.we ordered the quest fundido- which was out of the world good. The mushroom quesedilla was amazing as well. The chili relleno however felt dry to the palette and the eggplant inside was undercooked plus the plate was pretty on on side and sloppy on the other side, the salmon sandwich was ok, didn't live up to my expectations, I've had better.the drinks were very good! So my rating would be 3 for the bad dishes and 5 for the good ones so averaging it out to 4 :)
