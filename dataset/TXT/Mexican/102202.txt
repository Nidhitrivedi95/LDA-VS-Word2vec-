F-PmkzyN80fVcNMN8Z2aiw Z'Tejas does not live up to Phoenix Southwest Mexican restaurant standards. The service is horrible, if you get a waiter named Jack ask for another table. No guarantees there either. Even the bussers were nasty. By the way we asked Jack for chips and salsa 5 times got em when we were done eating. If you like high prices, medlocre food, small portions and lousy service this restaurant is for you.
