qL1YWy7auU6K7H68WQxNqw I'm writing this review only after many many times of this location continually getting my order wrong. Whether it be them forgetting to put sour cream on an item I PAID to have it added to, or them not giving me my change. Today they didn't put my hot sauce in the bag after asking me 30 seconds prior if I wanted any... how does it not make it in the bag? It's all in the same vicinity you're standing in! Not to mention they are out of Baja blast at least once a week. I come here pretty often because it's so close to my house, but I'm honestly about to start driving to the one that is 10 minutes away just to stop having to deal with their stupid mistakes. This isn't a once or twice situation, it's a every other visit situation. Save yourself the irritation and go to the next location.
