3SLDrXzPmKF0iCY8WriLsA Friendly service and really good food! We ordered a small burrito and a taco, both with chicken. The taco seemed a bit overpriced but the small burrito was a good value. The chicken was great - moist and flavorful, as were the salsas. The tortilla was a bit dry but otherwise we had a great experience.
