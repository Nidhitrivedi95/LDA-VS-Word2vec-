vCopginiBsz1STNhQPb8XA After spending over a year researching vegan eats all over the east coast, I knew the thing I would miss most about NYC and Philly is the array of vegan dining options that central IL is severely lacking. Luckily, this Dog came dancing into my life and did more than soften the blow...

Specific favorite things about DD:

1.) Dessert: Ever heard of Vegan Treats in Bethlehem, PA? It was named one of the top 10 bakeries in the world. I can honestly say that after trying ~ 20 treats from there, I have had DD desserts that I've enjoyed more than many at VT. DD has new desserts every day, so it's my favorite part each visit to walk in and see what's on display. Some days have a better selection than others, so I wish the pastry department would expand to guarantee at least 2-3 cakes/cupcakes each day (always so moist and decadent). Some gems I've tried are GF vanilla lavender cake, "ricotta" cheesecake trifle, peanut butter fudge, and an oatmeal cream pie that would make Little Debbie abandon her reign and go veg for life.

2.) Lunch/Dinner options: I'm happy to see the menu is expanded, although I certainly don't have a problem with the kitchen continuing to experiment with even more options for me to try. (; Here are some highlights:

-- Soups. They have an actual soup wizard working for them. One Soup of the Day I was particularly impressed with a couple months ago, humbly titled "mushroom", was full of beautiful shiitakes, shining in a rich and silky umami broth of love. The chili is offered daily and it is also very tasty, hearty yet light and full of vegetables in addition to the beans.

-- Down & Dirty Dog.  This dog isn't made of random appendages from who knows how many species of animal. Nor is it the beige rubber stick that vegans have been begrudgingly choking down at bonfires for years. It's the best dog I've ever had. And the slaw and baked beans are even better, offering a hint of sweetness and a creamy crunch. There's also a pickle involved if you want even more crunch and tang, but I kind of liked eating the pickle separately because the slaw and beans are too good to be "speared" like that (ha).

-- Seitan Rueben. I've had other versions of this, including the famous Chicago Diner one, but DD's is special in its own right. I love that the seitan is made in-house because I know many vegan restaurants (even Vedge, the best vegan restaurant in the country) use seitan from outside sources. Plus DD's thousand island relish is crazy good. 

-- Quinoa Scoop On A Bed. I once heard another customer tell a server the salad should be renamed to "Mound of Goodness". I wouldn't disagree. Mostly because of that tangy avocado dressing, but also because I when I want a salad, I want a legit sized bowl full of dark green and purple leaves, not a handful of lettuce with a tasteless tomato on top. 

3.) The Veggs Bennedog for Sunday brunch. The Hollandaise sauce is insane. Who needs egg yolks ever? Even better with spinach!

4.) Staff: Everyone I've met here has been awesome; not just knowledgeable about the food but actually excited about it too (an unfortunate rarity in the food industry). I've even had a some interactions with the owners Linda and Brian (who are usually around - another sign of a great restaurant), and I can tell they are wonderful people who care about the food being served, and treat their employees well.

Overall, the Dancing Dog executes well what it has set out to be: a place where vegans and non-vegans can happily mingle with plenty of satisfying and tasty options, mostly reminiscent of traditional cafe/diner fare. They're still new and have a ton of potential to grow, which is exciting because they are off to an excellent start. This being said, the main suggestion I'd like to see more of in the future is fresh produce shining in more dishes.. Especially seasonal; it is winter so I'd love something like sweet potato gnocchi and roasted kabocha squash in sage brown butter sauce. (Also I hope real lemons are used in lemon cakes, not lemon extract, for example.) 


(Final note, in response to a previous comment about using items from the vegan section of a grocery store... First, only a few menu items here even contain faux meats, certainly not the majority of the menu. And much like how non-veg restaurants do not construct chicken cutlets out of pantry ingredients and witchcraft, I'm guessing DD chooses certain faux meats because they cannot produce them in the kitchen. No, vegan restaurants do not NEED to use processed faux animal products, but the truth is that many vegans and non-vegans alike are intrigued by dishes that resemble childhood favorites, for instance, that we no longer eat because of the poor practices of the meat and dairy industries. Regardless, while 3-4 dishes on the menu use such "meats" as a component, the kitchen does their own seasoning/treatment to them, and all the accoutrements they are served with are house-made and delicious!)
