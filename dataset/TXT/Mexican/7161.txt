_Kd0kQ8RF70hJ1ykLqCRyQ Been here multiple times before and tonight was a disappointment. The rice was not cooked and made our meals very inedible. It's sad when your expectations of a restaurant is always stellar and then they disappoint this way. I know everyone has their bad days but because of this, it left anmad taste in our mouth, literally.
