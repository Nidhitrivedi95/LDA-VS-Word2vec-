J7B-hSSYDYSIQx5xiqOJTw Just left this restaurant.  I have been wanting to try this place for lunch.  So my husband and I went today.  The table was dirty, the chairs had food on them and the menus even were dirty.  Not to mention the table was wobbly and uneven.  Don't know how the food is as we didn't even get a glass of water offered to us as we sat and waited for at least ten minutes.  So needless to say we left and won't be coming back.
