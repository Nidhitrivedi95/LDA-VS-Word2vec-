Iexe2eXRLZLCj6v5tCMiDg i would give this NO starts if yelp let me. this place is absolutely awful. some of the vegetables in my salad were rotten -- tasted and smelled gross and mouldy. the owne offered to partly reimburse me. the whole place was very dirty and disorganized. seriously, skip this dirthole if you can. the owner Lee doesn't care about her business at all and is serving unsafe food.
