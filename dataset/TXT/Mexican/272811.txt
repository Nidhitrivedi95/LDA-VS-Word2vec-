wvlF1x7Cm8UGu6iD0LgIJw Here's the thing. If I were to write solely on the food,
My review would be much higher. I could even go with four stars. The food isn't bad, especially for airport food. My burrito with chips and queso tasted just fine and hit the spot, the but customer service here it truly terrible.

While I waited for my connecting flight home, I stopped here. While I waited in line I watch the employees make fun of customers under their breath, give numerous customers attitude, and crack unnecessary jokes behind the counter. It was kind of uncomfortable to be around honestly. One employee was laughing so hard (at a customers expense) that she couldn't wait on anyone because she was buckled over from laughter.

I would have left honestly but I had already ordered to be honest I was starving. It was bad, very bad. I fly through there somewhat regularly and will never stop there again because of that.
