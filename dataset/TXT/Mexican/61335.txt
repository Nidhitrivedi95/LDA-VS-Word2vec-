ASC3JV2Jh09lTyJZ98UMFA At the recommendation of another yelper, I tried this place for lunch.  

This restaurant used to be in an old Hardees building and I loved the patio there but they recently moved down the street to a larger building behind Talbot's.  

On the inside it looks like the place doubles as a nightclub since one area has sparsely placed tables and there are colored lights up on the ceiling.  On the front wall appears to be  where a DJ booth might be with cables coming down from the ceiling.

Anyway, the restaurant is spacious and a better than the previous location.  

The service was awesome.  My server said I made a good selection on my order.  It was something that was recommended to me but I can't remember the name of it.  On my next trip, I'll order the Pollo Fundido and compare it with Monterrey.  Anyway, Paola, my server was very attentive and friendly.  

The food was decent;   The guacamole was great.  The salsa was good but not as good as Monterrey's.  The meal was something I wasn't expectiing.  Chicken in a spicy sauce on tortilla chips smothers with cheese and onions.   It was a nice change.

Maybe with another visit or two, I can update my rating on this restaurant.
