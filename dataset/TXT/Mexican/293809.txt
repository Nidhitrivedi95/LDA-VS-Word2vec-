yz66FIUPDKGhILDWzRLeKg Such a cool place. My husband had the Chile Rellenos. We were in Albuquerque NM many years ago and he had them there and loved them. He's never found another place that makes them the same till now! The Chile left whole and stuffed then fried with a coating and served crispy. He said they were fantastic. I had the Philly cheesesteak sandwich and it was delicious! Piled high with lots of roast beef, grilled peppers, onions and cheese. The bread was toasted perfect, still soft but with a slightly crispy outside. The au jus was very flavorful as well. Carrie was a new server and did a great job, she was friendly and attentive as were the owners. They have several great choices on the menu with green chilies from Hatch, NM. Lots of options from salads, burgers, Mexican food, sandwiches and bowls. We look forward to going back and trying more of their great food, there was so much that sounds amazing on the menu. The owner said they have live music on Friday nights. Worth checking out.
