joTw5858fDh3Y_rF0NDOsg went there a couple of years ago and were very disappointed in the food and the service (dining room). 
gave it another chance the other night because I was craving flan and the reviews were good....worst flan I ever had! and the service is still bad (bar). 
Just because it's cheap and the portions are big doesn't mean it's good...quite the opposite.
