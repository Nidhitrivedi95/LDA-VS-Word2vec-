3te8dGIvzz5V5_kMIr6-Dg Jackfruit Tacos with rice and black beans was very tasty although a bit sweet for my liking (although this seems to be a regular issue with BBQ sauces lately). My accomplice had the Seitan Burrito which was excellent and substantial in quantity. Great to have innovative veggie food like this around.
