y1VInN5m3RbHU59kiQbmxA I've been passing this interesting looking place for years, 10 in fact, and finally this last Sunday with little else open I did a U-turn and popped in. The colors made my eyes pop! Just sitting in that beautiful renovated home and viewing the colored plates and white napkins in beautiful glasses with linen on the tables made me feel romantic. Well it was Sunday morning, and therefore I was very hungry. We were the only one's there but the waiter was so nice to us and took time to explain the specials and told us of their many freshly squeezed juices. I had pinneapple juice which was wonderfully flavored, Tortas, and homemade guacamole sauce. I was blown away, the chips were actually made there and real tortilla shells. He said weekdays were busy at night but weekends were rather empty, lunch crowd perhaps. Either way I definitely will go back and wish I could bring a pretty senorita with me in all her glorious spanish heritage to have an exquisite night in this cozy setting.
