8ysapimCImBSDKl28qIrjA I have been to this Carolina's location as well as the Cave Creek location on dozens of occasions and this one is almost always unbearable.  The salsa dispensers are almost always empty.  The trash is always overflowing.  There is always food all over the floor and tables.  There are dirty rags left out on top of tables and trash cans.  And the ice machine is almost always empty.  

I even took the time to write the manager about these unacceptable conditions after seeing them over and over and was replied with "There was a new guy on the trash cans and a manager called out."  They obviously don't care about customer satisfaction or keeping a clean environment.  

Looking at the other reviews I know I am not alone on this.  The Cave Creek and Cactus restaurant is just as busy but still manages to keep their salsa jugs full, ice full, trash taken out, and floors fairly clean.  I am okay with eating on paper plates and plastic untensils but I am not okay with eating at a dump.  The next time I return if it is in the same condition I am taking a picture and sending it to a health inspector.  

Absolutely disgusting and unacceptable!
