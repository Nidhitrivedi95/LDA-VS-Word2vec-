V94gk_Vx0Ot623UGHG6PrA Loved that there was no wait at 7pm (I realize this should have been my first clue but I was starving)!

Liked the chips and the 3 salsa platter.  Our waitress was nice but she did disappear for quite some time.

Disliked that our food came out wrong, charred and some things tasted as though they had been previously frozen.
