eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg I guess ALL the  hype had my expectations up - did not meet the hype or deliver. Food was good - but service was better. Not fond of bread with Mexican food and French fries are certainly different.

Good selection of margaritas little pricey -- my preference is still Barrio Queen in Scottsdale, better food , overall atmosphere, parking , location to walking , places to drink , dance and hangout after dinner.  

One other suggestion is the owner should stay out of politics and focus on the restaurant  business or run for Mayor:)!
