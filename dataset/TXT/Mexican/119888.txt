Went there for a date with my husband and had a hard time talking because it was just so noisy inside. Outside was just as loud.

The server was a bit spacey and kept forgetting to check on us, bring silverware, or get our drinks. I Ordered the steak taco and the shrimp taco. The steak was a bit bland and the sauce overpowered the taco. The shrimp was flavorful. 

All in all, the food was not bad but a bit pricey; especially charging $5 for salsa!
