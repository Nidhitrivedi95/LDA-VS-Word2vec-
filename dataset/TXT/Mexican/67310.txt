BgQ5ob0QiZfO5YbgI7VyFw I had a late lunch (early dinner?) here today and was blown away by the great service! The food came out quickly.

The chile rellenos ARE FANFUCKINGTASTIC. The enchiladas were ok - they're really meaty, so my boyfriend enjoyed it, but I usually love dishes that have lots of veggies. Just personal preference. The complimentary nachos and salsa are high quality too. 

But the real winner was the pumpkin brulee, which was likely to be seasonal because it was on the chalkboard specials and not the menu. It's $8, which seems steep but the pumpkin brulee is QUITE big so it's definitely big enough to share between 2-3 people.

(Unless you are a sugar fiend like me - I ate the whole thing by myself!)

Happy hour is a good deal - you can get house margaritas for $4!

The service was what convinced me to give the last star.. Seriously great!!!!
