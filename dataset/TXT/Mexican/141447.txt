jBKJMUcMuBmHqe5_U7GQ0Q I was hesitant to try this place as so much of the Mexican food in Pittsburgh is a HUGE disappointment. But I have to say that El Campesino is the only Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh that I will go to at all now. The food is good, the prices are completely reasonable, the menu is expansive, and the waitstaff is great. I know that they have a few locations around the city and I would happily go to any of them as I believe it is family owned. Love it, don't be hesitant to try it.
