lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw It's aight. 

Libre is an "upscale" Mexican cantina located in the Red Rock resort, and the food is good, but the price is a tad high. I came here after seeing a movie and decided to try this over Yard House. We shared the bean and cheese dip and an order of fajitas with lettuce wraps, $22 for the steak fajitas and almost $9 for bean dip. 

The steak fajita flavor was good, but it was a little on the salty side. The veggies were still crisp, and the steak was tender, this is a great option for sharing. The lettuce wraps needed to be doubled-up to hold the hot food, but when you're trying to be healthy, you can't scarf down three or four tortillas. 

The bean dip was... well bean dip. Not sure how they make it, but I have a feeling that "Tostitos" might be behind that chef's jacket. I normally hate it when people complain about price in their reviews, but when you charge $9 for what taste like canned bean dip, you got some splaining' to do. 

Like I said the food was good, but not enough for me to drive back to this side of town. I did get a free margarita with my Yelp check-in and which "liberated" me of feeling too bad for the price of food.
