Hf64S1mE01qTOghyCa81cA Brand new place in Sun Prairie, so I'll give them a little leeway on the service. 

First, you order at the counter from a chalkboard menu which has a great variety of authentic Mexican food to choose from. I chose the steak burrito and a pork taco. They are still working to perfect taking orders and we're a little slow, but I'm sure they'll figure it out. They also had some trouble with the chip reader for my credit card which slowed things down a little. 

They gave me a number to take to my table but I didn't have to wait more than about 5 minutes for them to bring my food. They also checked on us once about half way through the meal. 

Both the burrito and the taco were very good, especially with the addition of the either green or red salsa, which was in squeeze bottles at the table. 

My son got the chorizo burrito and said he really liked it. The only confusion was that they didn't tell us which was which, so we had to cut into them to find out. Really no big deal. 

Overall, we were happy with our experience and will be back.
