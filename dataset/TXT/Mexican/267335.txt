WjkjrsOzMAQ2wgY9tVyS0Q Chipotle line was out the door, so I figured let's see how Qdoba is still in business. Upon walking in, the tables were mostly all dirty. I go to order, and see the kitchen is disgusting. Rags and trash scattered throughout the kitchen floor, and there was raw chicken next to cooked chicken just a few feet away from a big bowl of guacamole that seemed to be sitting out too long. I then go to order, and get to give my order to someone who'd rather be watching grass grow than work there. The other employees have their pants halfway to their knees... (How appetizing). The food itself? Chicken tastes like it was manufactured then injected with silicone. Corn seemed like it was fresh... Out of a can a week ago. Rice was exact same as chipotle with cilantro, yet was much more gross and mushy.

Oh, and to top it all off... It's more expensive than chipotle!! Isn't that great. Disgusting kitchen, inappropriate employees, manufactured food, and all for a higher cost. Fantastic.
