4mb32UmQULqg7IMck28vog Horrible service. 2 other tables in restaurant . Waited over 30 minutes for food and drinks. Drinks were not brought out with food or before food. Had to wait another 10 minutes for drinks. Staff only starred at us while we ate and had to wait another 10 minutes after done eating for the server to come over and give us the check. Food was ok small portions. Never going back!
