SW6ZQk22G1_CV81_gfnvNQ La Carnita is hands down my favourite Mexican restaurant within the GTA. From their appetizers to their tacos, to their desserts and drinks - I can never get enough of this place. 

Service and Environment:
It's a pretty small restaurant so be expected to sit in a close proximity to other tables. It's a fun, hipster-like and minimal lighting environment with good loud music. Wait time for food is quick and service is spectacular. 

Food
Where do I even begin?? Here is a small breakdown of some of my favourite menu items. 
Starters:
Tortilla Chips with either (or all) Guacamole, Corn Salsa, Spicy Bean and Smoked Queso - a great starter, especially if you're with a group of friends! 
Mexican Street Corn - So so so good if you're a big corn on the cob fan; very flavourful and delicious. 

Tacos!
To be honest I love all of them LOL but my favourite would have to be the "Carnita" and "In cod we trust". They are very generous with the portions and I find that each taco comes with a lot of meat and toppings. Each taco is around 4-5 dollars and you can buy them individually. 

Desserts!
I am IN LOVE with the desserts that are offered here!! My absolute favourite is the Tres Leche Cake, it's a traditional Mexican sponge cake that is soaked in three different types of milk, giving it a very moist and soft texture. My second favourite dessert menu item are the Paletas, which are basically ice cream popsicles that come in a variety of flavours such as key lime pie, cookies and cream, strawberry shortcake etc. (Flavours change everyday).
