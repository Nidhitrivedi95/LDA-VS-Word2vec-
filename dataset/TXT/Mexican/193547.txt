OPcGFLP_mRt9yvgP3ALXOQ Now given that this restaurant just opened June 1st of this year, I think they are doing an amazing job! One thing is for sure, that this place is a stand out on Washington rd from the rest. The atmosphere is relaxing, festive, modern, and they have plenty of seating. However, after 5pm they get busy and is usually a wait. 
   Today we arrived at 5pm and were sat immediately. They sat us in a booth where we were able to look at the restaurant and bar. Our server, Enrique, was very nice. He was able to guide us through their menu, as it was a tad overwhelming. The drink menu was extensive. And being that we were there before 6pm we were still able to enjoy happy hour, that included $1 off drafts and half off margaritas!
    Tonight I ordered a cup of corn soup. That was delish! If you light creamy corn you would defined enjoy this soup! Add some hot sauce and it's awesome! The choriqueso is an app. It is a cheese fondue made at the table with peppers and beef. This was very good as well! We also had the chicken fajitas. The fajitas portion was huge and can defined be shared! Just ask for extra flour tortillas. For desert I ordered the fried ice cream. This was also very big in portion! It was the Mexican way fried ice cream. With the vanilla ice cream rolled in a cornflake, put in a fried looking desert tortilla and topped with a mountain of whipped topping. Very yum!
   Overall, a win. Very happy with this place. They have outdoor seating, a back dining room, a bar to sit at while you wait for a table, great and friendly servers and hosts. Thumbs up! Not a thing negative to say this visit!
