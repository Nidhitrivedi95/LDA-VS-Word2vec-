8nNB_yG1gzVpbqNH2EBucg Ive lived in ahwatukee my whole life and have been to ztejas years ago but my experience a couple days ago truly shows what i was missing out on. I forgot the servers name but he was a tall younger man with long hair. He did have a red pocket square and looked like the only one with one on (very nice touch to the plain black uniforms by the way) My fiance and I are not really big Margarita drinkers but he recommended the chambord blended margarita and it was ammaaziinnggg. We had the queso appetizer which was delicious! I ordered the shrimp and chicken diablo pasta (by our servers recommendation again)  and the plate was prepared perfectly! I usually go to oreganos for this similar plate but ztejas blows them out of the water! The place and bathrooms looked very clean also. Everything from the food to the service and the cleanliness was on point! I really wish i rememberd the servers name so he could receive  acknowledgement for his great service. We will be returning!!
