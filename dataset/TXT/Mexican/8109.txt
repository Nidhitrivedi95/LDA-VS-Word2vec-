_QL-D_zQ-RSdlsMZF3TLyg This is the worst chipotle in the area, and unfortunately the closest one to my house. No matter when I go- 4:56 or 8, they are out of SOMETHING. They have a bunch of employees but none of them are ever 'there.' They always have blank looks and stare off into space, generally acting as if they do NOT want to be there. And I get it- but at least pretend to be awake. It's not fun to hear employees complaining about customers and themselves while you eat. But do I get in my car and drive to a better location? No.....
