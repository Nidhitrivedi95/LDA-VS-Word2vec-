O1ird5yRyuDFnOmYu90OoA This is such a little jewel in Lawrenceville. I discovered it and am happy I did. I ordered chips and dip to start. Yummy. Did was soupy. I would had prefer something more soild but still good. For entree I had the California burrito. Taste was good. A twist to burrito was a potato wedge in the middle. Nice! Typical Margarita to drink. Bartender was great! I sat at bar. I arrived around 8:30 p.m crowd was average. Around 10 p.m. crowd got thick. Nice blend of ppl.
