7Q2cYSl5NBYytJzgjX0oKw Unfriendly bar/bouncer staff, overpriced drinks, mediocre atmosphere. I've been to sandbar Tatum on a couple of occasions before and had a good time. Tonight I had one of the worst customer service experience at this place . It was a kick back night for me and my roommates. Our 1st round of drinks consisted of one bartender asking repetitive idiotic questions about our drink order.Although baffled by her stupidity, I continued to be polite. The 2nd round consisted of pricey and  watered down don Julio shots in which the bartender claimed the shots were bigger than we thought because the glasses were "big". Trust when I say these were shots were watered down. This is not my first Rodeo folks. the next round consisted of the same round of shots for even more $ with no rhyme or reason. My roommates brushed it off.  
Shortly after, a bouncer proclaimed that he needed to see my ID for a 2nd time. And after asking him what the purpose was, he responded with "there's a state law that requires you to furnish your idea when asked". After I asked him exactly which law he is referring to and to see if he could show me HIS id, his response was "I don't know which law but it's a statute and now you have to go. " - dumbass.
The manager who we spoke with ending up being douchier than the rest and was very unhelpful. 
WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. It doesn't take a lawyer to recognize when someone is a liar with no ambition and nothing better to do with their sorry, unfulfilled, and meaningless lives. Sandbar, I learned, is not the place for me and I would not recommend this place to anyone. I have better things to do and will not ever visit this horrid place again.
