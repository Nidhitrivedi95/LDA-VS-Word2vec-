i4QxkI-oZgFLD_dShF4F7g Went to El Rincon and was amazing!
Lets Start with the Service, one of a kind we 
Were kindly greeted and served immediately place was busy but that did not matter, they gave us a table right away even though we didnt make a reservation.
Food was the best part. Big portions, great flavor and it just tasted like mexico. Guacamole is a must and tacos are fantastic. Overall a great place to go. Ill be coming back especially for the patio.
