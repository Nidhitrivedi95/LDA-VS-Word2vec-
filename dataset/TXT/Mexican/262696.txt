vz8HFGsITt6aj-nyXkAEFg The food here is decent.  It is basically like any other Mexican restaraunt in Phoenix- like Ariba and what not.  Same menu, same items, etc .  Nothing special, but this place does have a duck pond which is a hit with the kids.  It's also HUGE.  Not sure if they ever fill the place, maybe for Cinco de Mayo?  I don't know.
