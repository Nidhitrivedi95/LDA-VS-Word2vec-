fIpGcpjBnyiILi8M2wJSUw I drive pass this place almost every single day , always see it full & finally decided to pull over to give it a try . A small hole in the wall restaurant, has one of the best tacos I've ever had in my life , keep in mind I'm a huge taco enthusiast , this location is moving to a small strip mall on Bethany home road & grand & extremely excited to see how the new location will look inside . The menu was written on poster board , but none the less simple & clear . I had my self two tacos de pastor al trompo, and two de longaniza, (tacos come in pairs) , I got my daughter two chicken tacos , and my boyfriend got a burrito de pastor. Tacos came garnished with cilantro, onion , and grilled onions & sliced chile toreados, with an slice of lime & an excellent green tomatillo salsa. Also the pastor tacos came garnishes with a few slivers or pineapple, the way real al pastor should be served . I'll definitely be back for more !
