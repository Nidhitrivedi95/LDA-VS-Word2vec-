7tdVsSDXRKtLLC-fD1hJ-A The customer service is great. This was my first time eating here and my mom told me I had to try it. I had some enchiladas and wow their portions are really huge. They are not greedy with the amount of food they serve you AT ALL lol. I had to actually take some of my dinner home because I couldn't finish it. The food was perfect, the service was excellent, and the environment was very professional and friendly. I will be coming back again for sure.
