hVC6E29dg5Rx4ADSxt3kTA I'm definitely not an objective reviewer when it comes to Restaurant Mexico. This is the food I grew up with! My mom started bringing me here when I was about two years old, and we've stuck with Restaurant Mexico ever since.

That being said, the cheese enchiladas are the best ever. I don't like enchiladas with melted yellow cheese; these enchiladas come with crumbly, soft white cheese inside and delicious tomatillo sauce all over the top. I don't order the refried beans or the rice (lard, lard, lard) but I've been assured that the enchiladas are lard-free (and so are the yummy chips!) The chicken enchiladas are just as good.

I almost always get the green enchiladas, but when I'm in the mood to shake things up a bit, I get the Clare Burrito with lard-free whole beens and guacamole. It's also very good, but, like I said, the enchiladas are definitely my ambrosia. 

Finally, the flan is unbelievably delicious! 

Now that I live in California, I miss Restaurant Mexico like crazy. We have good Mexican food in the Bay Area, but not like this! Every time I come back to Phoenix, this is one of my first stops.
