oWxiT2PasutHFyZp8Yh2mA We were in the area and looking for something quick.  This place seemed to get decent reviews, so we stopped.

First, they need to turn the A/C up.  It was seriously warm in there!

I'll skip the preliminaries and get to it.  My wife ordered the caldo de res, and I ordered #6 (burrito and enchilada combo).  Probably waited about five minutes before the burrito was ready, and maybe another five for the caldo de res.

My wife had to replace the caldo de res.  It was way too salty.  I mean almost like sea water salty.  I tried it also, and it was way too much.  To their credit they took it back and offered her something else.  She opted for the carnitas.  So how was the carnitas?  It was dry pork.  Not moist.  No seasoning.  Just dry pork.  Her refried beans were like what you'd get from a can.  The rice was so mild it may as well have been white rice.  Adding their red salsa helped it a bit, but still weak.

The enchilada was cheddar cheese in a tortilla.  That's it.  I should have asked up-front.  I'm not a fan of cheese enchiladas, but this was just an oily cheddar cheese (with more cheddar on top).  So even by cheese enchilada standards this was not good. The one saving grace was that the burrito was good.  Simple, but very good.  The burrito saved them from a one-star rating.  Well, give them credit for replacing the very salty caldo de res, too.  If I had ordered only the burrito I'd probably have gone with three stars.  Everything else was sub-par.

We won't be returning.
