1O5wKnCuT643BjCu4g8Mgg Ok, there are gonna be two kinds of people who read this review: those who've eaten at Chipotle, and those who haven't. My apologies if you find yourself in the latter category.

So for whatever reason--I suspect provincial politics are to blame--there are no Chipotle locations in Montreal, though they are present in most other major Canadian cities. That might have been ok. I'm not a slave to the Chipotle brand, but I do recognize and detest the thinly disguised and poorly executed imitation that is M4 Burritos.

But ok, all this aside, right? Who cares if someone looked at someone else's good idea and capitalized on an open market. Let's get down to the grit. Let's talk about why I'd recommend you avoid M4.

1) Almost without fail, the meat (chicken, steak, barbecoa) is dry, poorly seasoned, or outright unavailable
2) Tortilla's are never right. They're dry, they rip, they tear, no one's happy
3) You'll get charged for even the slightest deviations from what their menu covers. Want grilled veggies? Extra. Want a tortilla with your salad bowl? Extra. Oh, and don't expect them to give you much of anything. Last I ordered a burrito bowl at M4 the girl didn't even fill it, as in I could still see the bottom of the tin, and when I asked for her to bulk it up she told me she would have to charge me extra
4) So you pay a lot and you don't really get that much food. And despite all the "Quebec local" fuss, the food doesn't even taste that great

Chipotle if you're reading this, HELP!
