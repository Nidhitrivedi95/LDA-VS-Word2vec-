HTlsBAd9j1wlWDHxnYczBw The chips and salsa are great here. But as I read the reviews before my meal arrived I noticed a common complaint. The food being cold. So, I normally judge a Mexican food place off the salsa and chips and since they were great, I figured the cold food must of been just 
An off day. Well my food comes and it looks great. I ordered the green corn tamale, shredded beef taco and a cheese enchilada with rice and beans. The rice and beans were good the taco was OK the beef really didn't have much flavor but it was deep-fried shell with lettuce tomato and cheese. My cheese enchilada was completely cold the inside the cheese was still cubed not even melted. And my green corn tamale which I could tell if it was cooked would've been probably good,but it was completely raw Massa. Super bummed. I was hoping this would be my new Mexican spot
