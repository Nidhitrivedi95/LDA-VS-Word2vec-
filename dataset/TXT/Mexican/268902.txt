woJ0p5-_bc1BCezm16qtZQ Worst customer service and no return policy yet when u take something back they won't accept it, but they accept them back if you Latino/Latina. They definitely discriminate I wouldn't recommend this place. Store is always dirty and things be rotten I won't be going there again. EL Super is way better than this place!
