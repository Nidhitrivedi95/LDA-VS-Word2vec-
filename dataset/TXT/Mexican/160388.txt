kxzS-zh5nUNvBzYz2Q47pg Spotted Donkey Cantina is one of two businesses in the mostly deserted Pedregal. This is a South West Mexican Style Restaurant. I ordered the Mexico City Carne Asada. They gave me a very large portion of chewy steak. It was suppose to be marinated with arbor chile that might have been delicious but I didn't detect that. It was chewy and not tasty. My stomach turned when I tasted the peppers and onions because they were sour tasting. I think the sour peppers and onions spread to the steak and I couldn't eat it. I asked my husband to taste the peppers and onions and he said they tasted funky. I also noticed the picco on my plate looked very old. (blow up picture this is visible) Off to the side of my plate was something that resembled pond scum....I was brave and tasted it. The green slime on my plate was oddly sweet with honey and lime and not tasty....it wasn't flavored right or maybe it was just old sauce. My tortillas were fresh tasting and the potato cakes were fried nicely and seemed free of oil with a nice crispy exterior but lacked the chile they were suppose to contain.

My husband tried the Poblano Chile Relleno. He said it was a Poblano Pepper stuffed with mushy pork and greasy mushy rice topped with a strange tasting tomato sauce. He said his meal wasn't as bad as mine.

Our waitress seemed nice and asked me if I wanted mine boxed up but I declined.

I didn't feel that I could complain about the food here because I was getting one meal free because of my Scottsdale Preferred Card.
