70WDApYtMcLlrnb1EUW6fg We were looking a good example of quality Mexican food in the local area. We found it here. It may not be a fancy restaurant but that's ok because the food and service were awesome. The enchilada style burrito with chorizo was spot on. I love little hole in the wall places that are like this. Food was a great price. We looked at over 25 restaurants for good food that won't break the bank. I feel like people only think food is good around here if it costs a ton of money. This place destroys that myth.
