I ordered 3 mini chimichangas which came with beans rice lettuce and tomato and a lime. Perfectly garnished with a sour cream was more than enough for me ended up taking half of it home. When I asked for a to-go box the waiter jokingly said "No, you have to finish it all here. " 
Ten minutes later I'm still waiting for my to-go box?.?.
The waiter came and apologized and brought me the to-go box. I will definitely be back this was a great experience.
