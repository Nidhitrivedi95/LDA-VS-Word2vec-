3CI95LMvt4u1xqEWq6CbnQ La Mexicana is a great place for authentic Mexican in Toronto. My friend found it when we were looking for a fun place to eat near Yorkdale mall, and this happened to pop up in the search.

As some of the other reviewers say, it is a smaller restaurant, cozy and when we went it wasn't overly busy. Being a vegetarian AND a Mexican, I was pretty thrilled to see a lot of good veggie options on the menu. To start we shared the Amigos Platter, which had a little bit of everything - it even came with a bit of mole to dip! And let me tell you - when they say queso Oaxaca, it is REAL queso Oaxaca. I have tasted different kinds of that cheese that you can find here in Canada, and it never seems to taste authentic. I swear if I closed my eyes while eating the queso Oaxaca they used I could almost imagine I was in a Sanborns.

For my main I ordered the veggie enchiladas. I was so excited that instead of the usual onion and pepper that most restaurants consider to be a good enough veg stuffing, these had broccoli and cauliflower! Yummmmm.

Their horchata is pretty glorious, and I had the flan for desert which was lovely and a great texture.

Bottom line is: the food is delicious, I'd go back again, service is great, but the overall design and environment could be improved. Still - this isn't something that would stop me from eating there :)
