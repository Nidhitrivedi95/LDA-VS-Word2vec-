lOQPeguczAueJnLmDUTfGg Normally me my boyfriend & friends go to eat here every time we go out to Vegas & honestly use to LOVE this place ! But this weekend that we were there the service SUCKED & the food had a different taste. . . I normally get the shrimp cocktail which is my FAVORITE & didn't taste the same as well as for the rest of the food ordered, what we did like was the oysters with ceviche on the top we got a dozen to share within 4 people & the waiter didn't bring us any side plates to use for them until we asked for the place was just way to dead unlike when Juan was there he was the life of this place !!
