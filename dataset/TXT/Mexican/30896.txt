4DLsC4BTUoEqFGusetQVlQ My friends and I decided to come here for drinks last night, as it was a place on my list that I always wanted to try. 

The interior was nice, a bit hipster.  The music was like being in a club. 

As we first got seated, we waited for quite some time to be attended.  Once we ordered, it was not until about 45mins-1hr later that we received our drinks, and we were not given any water, just empty cups. 

 It was such a long wait that we were contemplating on just cancelling and leaving. 

We ordered: Who Shot Ya?, The Palmomita and the Friday night special which was a turkey something. 

I had order the crispy cotija for myself and the churros to split. Food wise it was good, but because of the poor service, I would not come back. 

This place gets 2.5 stars in my books for just the food.  But because there is no .5 star, I'll give it 2 because the service was just awful.
