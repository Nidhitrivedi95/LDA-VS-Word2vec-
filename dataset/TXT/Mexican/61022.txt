arpBUwgiaE8iqfNGMQ_hgg I have been a few times, the burritos were good, they have a great selection too (I love the breakfast burrito, and the squash burrito)
Went yesterday though, ordered a burrito, and the cook made it really well, but when I asked for a bag, the cook just pointed at the bags.
He didn't know that my right hand doesn't work, but would it have been so hard to put my burrito in a bag himself when I asked?
Bad customer service, I wont be back, there are so many other places to get food in the market.
