46hnat0aLao-qYWZkN9aBg I love los dos! The foods is to spicy for my family so I usually order Togo I always get the same thing and the same gentlemen always take my order. I always order the same thing needless to say my order was not what I wanted so I took it back seemed like a simple enough mistake to me felt they would take the food and make it right but instead about 4 of the workers come up and start arguing with me asking do I wanna see the menu to which I say no.... it end me just saying give me my money back 16.50 which is high af for some enchiladas  but anyways  yeah they def lost a customer smh guess they don't value their neighborhood customers!
