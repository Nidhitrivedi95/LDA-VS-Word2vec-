SOOSUg-ugRI8dRQ96r5Fxw Been dying to try this place due to the positive Yelp reviews but have yet to be afforded the chance.  The location is closed on Sundays and is only open during breakfast/lunch hours during the week.  We busted our butts to get there last Saturday to get there before they closed at 2.  We arrived at 1:30 to a locked door and closed shop.  No sign on the door. hours posted matched Yelp.  Really disappointing.
