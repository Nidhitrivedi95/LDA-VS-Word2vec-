XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg i hate bobby flay. but i loved mesa grill. 

though i love new york and all its braggadocio, i feel that the food network's brooklyn boy, bobby flay, takes pretentious to a new level, and it's not amusing. i'm completely annoyed by his show throwdown, where he challenges local food legends and presumes to make their dishes better than they do. i'm fully aware that the man has had 9 restaurants, 9 cookbooks, and 8 total TV shows, but there's something about him that i just don't like. plus, he's a ginger. (just kidding, i actually love red-heads!)

but mesa grill? soooooooo good! R. R. and i sat at the bar for dinner and enjoyed every minute. i had the black bean soup with cumin crema and three relishes, and really, i would bathe in that soup it's so good! i had my face in the bowl and was licking it clean when R.R. gently reminded me that we were in public and ladies generally try not to eat like wildebeests. my bad. sophie's chopped salad was good, but nothing special. R.R. made some good choices as well - be sure check out the rough-cut tuna "nachos" and the shrimp and corn tamale. and the bartenders were awesome; one mixed us a free taste of his special "red bull mojito" - yummy! 

so while i'm glad to have checked out mesa grill because the food was incredible, i only wish that my hard-earned money were going to someone other than douchebag flay.
