L-Go77QiXmXsYt9dYULPww Three visits and lots of dishes and all have been excellent.  The service, though, is what makes it tops.  Extremely friendly and courteous.  We've never had to ask for anything.  Water, more napkins and refills just quietly appear.   

The shrimp fajitas are succulent.  These are jumbo shrimp, juicy and flavorful with a hint of lime and butter. The chicken chimi is stuffed with a grilled chicken breast, not shredded chicken.  And, as another person posted, the seasoning is spot on.  Unlike some Tex-Mex places, the food here feels as though someone lovingly and painstakingly prepared it to order.  

Quickly becoming my favorite Mexican.
