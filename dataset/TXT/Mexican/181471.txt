nEIWxj6m1gGWe1gi596Zvg I haven't been to this location in a long time. The staff was not welcoming. I felt very rushed to order my food. I was ordering for my family of four. The lady making it talked so fast I could barely understand her. She didn't even make eye contact. I was also using coupons I got in mail from Chipotle. Buy one get one free and buy something and get chips and salsa free. They wouldn't let me use both. I have used these before and have never been told no. Customer service was terrible this visit. Doubting how the food will taste when I get home. Chipotle is usually a great place to go. They also packed my food into a small bag ao heavy the handles broke.
