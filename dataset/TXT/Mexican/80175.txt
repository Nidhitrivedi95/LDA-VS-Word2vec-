cWtUKKsnEYy1WeR1aEdyMA We went to Fonda Lola last night as a party of 10 guests and had the $40 tasting meal.

+ First off, the drink I had was a basil mojito and that very good!

I can't really have the same enthusiasm for the food.  The food quality was good, but the taste was just not there for me.  I've had better in the city.  The nachos were good, but more guacamole was needed on the plate to finish the nachos.  Each taco that I had (carnitas, fish, steak) was bland... even with the accoutrements.  Their version of Caesar salad was the opposite of bland and actually had WAY too much garlic.  And finally the Dulche do Leche cake was just okay.  Unfortunately, we didn't get to have their proper version of churro (we had some sort of event cake), which I understand is normally very good.

+  The jalapeño candied bacon is awesome and stands out from the entire meal for me.  It was the perfect combination of salty, sweet, and spicy.  Thumbs up here.

As for the service, the gentleman was very nice... I think it may have been Andreas Marquez.  He was very hospitable for us, but everything felt a bit rushed.  There were plates that we didn't finish and they were taken off our tables, including the steak, which had 1/4 plate meat left!  That is a HUGE no-no in my books.  It was rushed off to the kitchen before we could say anything; we should have been asked if we wanted to finish.

And finally, their machine wasn't working, and we needed to bring cash.  Not a big deal, but added on top of the rest of glitches, it didn't leave for the best dining experience.  Thankfully, our group was a good one and we were able to have fun anyways.  

Anyways, the experience wasn't bad... it was okay.  Perhaps a function of bringing in 10 people for a meal (?).
