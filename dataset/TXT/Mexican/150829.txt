Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ Service here is rock star, thanks Sammy!

After taking our lives in our hands by crossing the "race track" they call the strip, eight of us bumbled in around 9AM (we were across the street at the Bellagio). Just like true Las Vegas tourists we began our day with Bloody Mary's, Mimosa's, French toast and Jimmy Buffet on the speakers. 

Is it a tourist trap? Sure, but if I have to be trapped somewhere this works. The food is hot, the girls are eye candy and the booze concoctions are inventive. The outside bar overlooks the strip and people watching is an absolute trip. Watching the bums harass the overworked hookers and the hookers flashing the "Jesus Saves" advocates is priceless! 

Oh, the food, it's not fine dining, if you're expecting that you'll be sorely disappointed. If you're looking for decent vittles priced as expected you'll be fine.  Burritos and burgers....What else what would you expect? They actually have a good breakfast selection too. 

We're really easy to please/fun travelers- very respectful to the people who bust their ass for us. The staff was amazing - really some of the best service I received on my trip - they should be proud of that.
