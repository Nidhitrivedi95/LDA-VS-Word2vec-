YaTlfyPieOXwHH16wzieFg So let me start of by saying how pleased I was with the staff here.  I think Zac was the man who helped me.  I was traveling through town in my swishy camo pants and was craving some authentic Mexican cuisine.  I live in California and as far as fast food goes we only have del taco and taco bell.  After my visit I wished that California will get some more locations more up north rather than in the LA market.

Zac is freaking Legend! thanks for my great first experience with Cafe Rio.  I am going to make sure to visit every time I pass through!
