I had the sea scallops as well and the flavor was spicy, yet savory and not heavy at all. Cooked perfectly. 

We sat on the back patio. It was just about 5 tables. Relaxed atmosphere. Service was perfect. We had 2 small children in our party and they were more than accommodating. 

Definitely a must-visit!
