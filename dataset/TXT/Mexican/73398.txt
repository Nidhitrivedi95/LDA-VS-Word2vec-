cf0LXwdYZ_9y0BVK-un9ow Coming from California, I've been suffering from carne asada fries withdrawals. I honestly had no idea this was a west coast thing, correct me if I'm wrong. After sifting through Yelp, we found out that this place served Carne Asada Fries. I was on a mission to try these, of course!! The first time we went, they didn't have any potatoes so I just got a chimichanga, which was good! The second time my SO and I came here, it was on another Sunday afternoon and we ordered right away. 

The chips and salsa they served us was quite good, and it had the right amount of heat for a spicy/hot food sensitive gal like me. We got sopes as an appetizer and our server was extremely awesome and got us two even though I had only ordered one. The sopes tasted so good that we were contemplating getting two more, until our fries came! They use freshly made crinkle fries and top it off with carne asada, melted cheese, pico de gallo, guac, and I had them add shredded cheese and sour cream on mine. It wasn't mind blowing but it was still pretty darn good! 

I'm officially a regular because of this lone menu item. If any Yelpers know of any other place that serves Carne Asada Fries, do let me know! :)
