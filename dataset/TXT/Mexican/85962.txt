Db3CfZWrtG33UZSs8Tdlsg Went for lunch and I've been back two times. I'm still waiting to be blown away like the other reviewers. Maybe I'm getting the wrong stuff. I've gotten a taco salad with barbacoa beef and I wasn't impressed. Meat was stringy. Another time I got Gordita with pork and they ask what kind of beans and I ordered black. I thought they come on the side, but they put them inside. That was annoying. Once again, the Al Pastor pork was on the dry side.
But the churros, omg the churros were delicious I! I didn't know they were filled with anything until I bit into it. They were crispy and warm with cinnamon sugar and what I believe to be dolce de Leche. Food is cheap and good, not great.  Order half hour ahead of time, because they get packed!
