l1GJnB9TJgGgEeI4at1M0A I went out of my way to eat here after class (UNLV) and I got 2 shrimp tacos and the shrimp quesadilla to go. The total came to just over $25, so it was a bit on the spendy side, but as a once in awhile splurge I would come back for that Shrimp quesadilla, it was loaded with fat shrimp and flavor and I savored every single bite. The service was brilliant, the location...meh, a bit on the tricky side, but overall...20 stars.
