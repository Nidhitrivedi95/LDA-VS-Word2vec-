r8hF3kwnZzxTo1IYNcI6rg Absolutely a hidden gem! This is a romantic, intimate little hole in the wall Mexican restaurant with a maximum room capacity of 43. Margaritas by the glass pitcher. Great food options. Amazing chips & salsa. You have to make a reservation. Jose is the best. Thanks for making a memorable night.
