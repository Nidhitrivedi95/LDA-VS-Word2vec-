iN3SrF5NO0xSf6umeUws-Q Lacks customer service. The lady working the drive thru window barely acknowledged I was there just took my money quickly and she was too busy sucking on her sucker (candy) kind of gross to be handling food. I won't be returning to this location, better off sticking to Los Betos down the road.
