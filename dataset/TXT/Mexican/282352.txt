XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Was...  Okay.  Maybe it's because we live in SoCal and are exposed to those flavors often, but we found ourselves disappointed.  The margaritas were great and the sweet potato clam chowder was unique and well seasoned.  The blue corn tamale side was dry, odd for something steamed, the replacement was equally bad.  The meat was okay but nothing to write home about.  For the price point I expected more.  If I was at my local steak house paying half that the value would have been there.
