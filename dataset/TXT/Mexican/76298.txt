CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q 5 spicy pork adobada tacos to start! At $2.25 each you can't beat that price for the explosion of taste at just one bite of this pork-filled yummy goodness on your tongue! Great for after party, late night, club food! The sauce is all the wonder; spicy, creamy, and tastey! 

Who needs to go south of the border when it can come to VEGAS! Even better, there are two locations of your choosing! I have visited both and can firmly account for both! Same fine taste, same bountiful servings, and same great experience! 

Take everything adobada style, it is their trademark and you just can't go wrong with that!
