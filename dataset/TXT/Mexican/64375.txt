B1xcP1i6-sZR48zjgpwyfg I just rolled into Madison for a conference, and I was tired, and looking for a place close to my hotel. So at that moment, I wasn't picky.

This place surpassed my expectations - the food was quite good - it's sort of caribbean-influenced american. It has great sweet potato fries, and a nice broad menu. The food was good, the service was attentive but not rushed (nice balance). 

I didn't have them, but they had pretty inexpensive crab legs, that the people next to me seemed to be enjoying.
