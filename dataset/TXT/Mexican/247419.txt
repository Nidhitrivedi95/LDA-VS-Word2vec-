TZl7YBuzo5awZP8QJDLg_w I had the #1 dinner with a margarita and beer. The drink was not potent. The beer went down well. The chips are pretty good. The salsa is horrible. It's more like tomato sauce than what I would think of as red sauce from a Mexican restaurant. There was no heat. On a scale of 1-10, it's a 1. 

The food was good. The rice and beans were noticeably better than average. The cheese enchilada was superb. It was my favorite item from the #1 and I'm not a big fan of cheese enchiladas, but it was perfectly melted and flavorful. The beef tamale was also excellent. The masa was moist and the meat was tender. The shredded beef taco was ok. Not outstanding. The bean tostada seemed good but I only tried a bite.

Overall the food was good except for the ketchup like salsa. They need some Tabasco or Chilula on the table as an option. I would visit again.
