rjlAUHT8B6KhKAmkZqS1xw I gave one star because the decor is beautiful.  Parking is bad.  Waited 5 minutes before a hostess, make that 3, showed up at the front to seat us and the other people behind us.  Our waiter was awful.  He gave one lunch and one dinner menu, which wasn't apparent at the time and I was told I couldn't order what I finally picked.  I say finally because it took forever just to look up the translation of each food item from Spanish to English.  It was more than your ordinary Spanish.  Yes, our waiter was gone that long.  The food was delicious, but over priced for the little there was of it.  Oh, did I mention that we never did get our appetizer, either.  The music was non stop blaring horns, which made conversation nearly impossible.  I hope it improves, drastically.
