bbovSsUMkTXQSIVNBa9moQ We stopped over here on the way to the city for dinner. Didn't know what to expect as the reviews are quite mixed. 

The restaurant itself is really nice. It's got a cozy feel to it with a beautiful patio. Unfortunately the patio was closing when we got there but they managed to seat us right next to it. 

We ordered the house margaritas which were fine. Nothing to write home about but not bad in any sense. Definitely should have asked for more tequila. 

We decided to share the nachos. The plate was huge! We didn't manage to finish it between the three of us. But it was delicious with huge dollops of Guac, sour cream and salsa. 

The mains are what really stood out though. The veggie tacos were delicious - very interesting fusion of Asian and Mexican cuisines with a punch. Healthy portions too! 

The service was great. Our server had helpful recommendations and really made us feel at home. 

I'd definitely come back when I'm in the area next! Highly recommended.
