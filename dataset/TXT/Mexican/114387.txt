GGecutXeoEVlYKoxVo2WPA Its ok. If you've been to "Rosa's" in Texas, its similar. You order your food at the register, and then you pick it up when they call your number. If you're hungry and want inexpensive, and don't mind a small restaurant, go here. If you want really good Mexican food, probably not the spot. Workers are friendly though. We were starving and needed a quick meal. This served its purpose. Just don't expect anything impressive. If you're curious, we ordered the mini chimichanga (beef....shredded) plate that came with rice & beans, Mexican nachos (large tin filled with ground beef, cheese, olives, sour cream and guacamole, taco plate (2 soft fried tacos with rice and beans), horchata, and 2 fountain drinks. Nachos were filling enough for my 9 and 7 year to share. (Keep in mind that my 9 year old eats like a teenager, and he wasn't starving after they finished, so that's a plus). Chimis were nice a crunchy & flakey. Would have been happy with 4 of those instead of the 2 with rice & beans. DH says his tacos were alright. The good thing is that their menu is pretty extensive, so there's definitely a lot to choose from. *Tip: if you order nachos and run out of chips, they have a mini salsa/chip bar, and they refill the chips constantly. Salsas aren't bad. I think they had 3 to choose from. For soups, I saw that they offer albondigas and menudo, but I think they only offer menudo on the weekend. HTH someone!
