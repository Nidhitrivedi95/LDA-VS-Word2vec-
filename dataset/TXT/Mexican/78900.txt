cRuShqUPD_QD5faU6S45sQ I've tried many sushi places around the valley and I am confident to say that this is the best one I have been. The portions are big and if you order anything out of the tradional sushi menus you will find a great taste in every bite. I also liked the inside of the place, very laid back. 

UNIQUE PLACE with excellent service.

TRY IT!!!!!
