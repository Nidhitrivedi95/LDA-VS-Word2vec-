YQFcxE9UXrKc-QuTUu7twQ Stopped in last Friday night around 8. Ordered four Corona Lights on a lark. I am not going to say that they were warm but they were far from acceptably cold.. Sat at a bar table for twenty minutes that was never cleaned off from the last group to include two tips from past parties just lying there. Two stars just because bars in Scottsdale never totally suck... you are in Scottsdale!
