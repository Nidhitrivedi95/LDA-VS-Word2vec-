They have some different options than a regular Taco Bell like sharable foods and alcoholic slushes but other than that, it's just another Taco Bell. Considering it's supposed to be an upscale Taco Bell, you would figure the service would be upscale as well. The employees that were there didn't seem like they wanted to be there.

With that said, the food was decent and the ambiance was great.
