a8pmtlVKf7NiSLI-4KejIw Some restaurants are great for a date, El Catrin definitely is one of those...

Huge patio and the interior decoration is just stunning. A work of art. 

We here for brunch and the portion size was more than adequate. The service was excellent and attentive.

But...

The food was a little disappointing, at least my Burrito de Meriscos ($19). The filling though sounded good: Shrimp, octopus, swordfish and lobster, salsa verde, cilantro, romaine flour tortilla wrap but it is really more like a cold seafood wrap without any seasoning. The thing is the side salad has a more intense lime vinaigrette dressing it further made the burrito disappointing.

The 2 egg dishes my friends have were much better! Omelet Machacados con Pollo ($12) and Huevos Racheros ($14) has nice flavours and served nice and hot! 

Taco Baja ($15) was not bad either.. The fish was fresh but the red coleslaw was not helping the taco much. It was forgettable...

Maybe I came with a high expectation... The only thing El Catrin wow me was the first 10 minutes when I walked in and after that the whole experience was just so so...

I would come back and enjoy El Catrin nice patio and even have a drink at the bar if I am in the area.

*Mexican Coke for $4.50 supposed to taste better since it is sweetened with Cane Sugar
