OBzPCuDTMBF4xijlnffnDw Stopped in Saturday morning while our brakes were being repaired across the street.

The restaurant looks like a little hole in the wall from the outside, but is actually fairly large, very clean, and very bright. 

They have an open kitchen, where you can see all the magic happening.

Its set up a bit like a Subway or Chipotle.  The menu is on the wall, and you dictate what you want on your burrito/taco/etc as it is made for you.

My husband and I chose the cheese quesadilla, I got mine with two sides, and he ordered a tamale.  Cheap, quick and easy. 

I know quesadillas are not hard, and aren't really the best thing to judge a place on, but they were good!  The cheese was gooey and melty, the tortilla was crisp, but chewy:  perfection.  

The beans and chips were great too.  I'll have to find out if they make the chips in house.  They were really nice. 

Fella's tamale was ok.  Flavor was great, but one side of it was super dry.  One of the downsides to premaking tamales.  The other half was perfect, and the flavor, like I said, was fantastic. 

The service was phenomenal.  
The two ladies working were friendly and fast.  Super polite. 

I can't wait to come back to try a burrito or taco!
