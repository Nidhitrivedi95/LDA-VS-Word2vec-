yg_oK5Luqh-VbsF0RK1teQ Just had my first experience at Moe's, and I have to say, never again! The whole place seemed terribly lacking in management and the kids running the place need some serious training. Handling cash and scratching your head with a gloved hand is not acceptable! The kitchen and dining areas were very dirty and neglected, portions were skimpy for the price, and most of the food was wilted or dried out. Not a good experience at all.
