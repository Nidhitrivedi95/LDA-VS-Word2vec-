frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A I'm not even sure why this place has so many reviews. I try to be nice about reviews cause I know how this effects various businesses. We went here on a Saturday night (group of 9); and before I even decided to rate this place.... I went around asking the entire crew what they would rate this place ... all of them either said 1 or 1.5 out of 5 stars.. When we got in, we had to wait for 45 mins to get a table... I mean that's understandable given the fact that we were a large group... once seated.... everything is just so slow. We ordered and the food literally took about 45-50 mins to come out. That's way too long. The waitress was nice. (only reason why I'm giving them a one star). I advise this business to give chips for free since the wait is so long. Anyways, overall ... not too happy with the service.. and the food wasn't all that at all. There's a lot better Mexican restaurants around!
