X57f6FWZiwI1wOidPPhOrQ So very disappointed in most of the reviews of Dos.  Yes, it is good, but they are so intent on getting the patrons in and out as quickly as possible that it really takes the enjoyment out of the whole experience for me.  If I want fast Mexican food, I'll go to some corporate dump thank-you-very-much.  El Toro is a step up, but the true gem of C-U Mexican cuisine is Fiesta Cafe.  The margaritas are outstanding, the fajitas large enough for me to split with my husband (that's saying something for us) and the waitstaff actually remembers their regulars. Te amo, Fiesta Cafe!
