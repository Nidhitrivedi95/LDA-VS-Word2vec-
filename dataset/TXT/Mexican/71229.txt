C2BR0TjNacoNzItPLUHTAA Love coming here for lunch occasionally with my coworkers. It's definitely a hot spot in North Scottsdale for such because sometimes it's hard to find an open table to sit down. Although I've not ever been to Hawaii, it definitely has the tropical vibes down. 

My first time coming, a coworker raved about the fish tacos.... so that's what I went with. The cashier let me know that the fish comes in daily from Hawaii so what you eat was swimming in the ocean the day or so before. And you can taste it, it's not gummy/funky-tasting fish! Two tacos + shared coconut shrimp are a tasty and light lunch. Definitely suggest checking in on yelp to get the discount on the coconut shrimp! The mango slaw is delicious and could use a little more mayo. Totally worth the $$ for what you get.
