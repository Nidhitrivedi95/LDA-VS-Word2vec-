JbWQtVLQDEOBlvbVWk2OFg No matter what happens nationally at any of the Chipotle locations - I will always be a fan. The food is fantastic. I get the same thing each and every time. I used to only eat chicken at most places, like Chipotle, but once I tried the barbacoa, I was in heaven. Barbacoa is pork that is very well seasoned and has great flavor (kind of like adobo sauce, not too spicy though). From now on, I only order a barbacoa bowl. It's amazing. I stopped at the location off Prospect and noticed it was CLOSED (note on doors said see you on the flip side), assuming due to the outbreaks they are having but it didn't say. I was disappointed, but happily drove to the campus location to see they were still open. :)
