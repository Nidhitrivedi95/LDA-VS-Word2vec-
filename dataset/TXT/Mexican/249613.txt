uhroo5AV1dcCHpI6ZQIj8w I used to love Rubio's, but after this visit, I've changed my mind. The food was mediocre at best... The chips and salsa were not fresh tasting and the beans were so bland. It's also a very crowded and difficult to walk through seating arrangement they have here. Single file, one way in to the back, and one way out back through... I didn't like the constant shuffle at all.
