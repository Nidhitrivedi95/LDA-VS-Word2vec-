DMwU0igEs9K7XuI3utsr6g I was in a rush between connections and needed to grab something fairly fast. I got a taco salad, and it was terrible. The romaine lettuce was mostly yellow and hardly any nacho chips. The dressing seem to be ranch with some chili powder mixed in. The barbacoa pork was actually decent.
