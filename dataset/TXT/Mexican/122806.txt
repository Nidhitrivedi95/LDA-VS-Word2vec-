hgo0jDweUcHMHqNDnQQm9A I agree with the other one star reviews.  This place is like taco bell with waiters.  Actually, I think i like taco bell more.  It is noooooo mexican restaurant.  They load up everything with costco shredded cheese and sour creme.  Don't waste your money.  Go to a real taqueria for real mexican.
