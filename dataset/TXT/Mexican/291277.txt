YSYDJTCt5kzY2kKnLNGRiA I have been coming to SOL for about three years now on and I don't know how I've never tried the Fish Taco Gobernador before!!!! It is sold a la carte, and it's well worth it. This taco has wild-caught fish, pan-roasted with lemon & garlic, on a taco dorado with cheese, salsa gobernador, avocado, onion & cilantro, pico & lettuce. 

If you love fish tacos, you're missing out if you don't try this one. 

The atmosphere at SOL is intimate, low lighting, live music at times. Great to catch up with family, friends, or a nice date night. They've really thought out the decor and design of the place. One of my faves. 

They also have great Taco Tuesday options and pricing if you're on a budget.
