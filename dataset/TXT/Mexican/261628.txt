VuYF1vGKLjEFaQfL4Ypwqg Finally was able to make it to Gallo Blanco, use to be a frequent customer from the location at the Clarendon Hotel.

The Fresh Guacamole and Chips are to die for and my go to is the Naco Torta. 

All the sauces and guacamole are so good and fresh, love the chips with the guacamole.

The marinated beef in the Naco Torta is killer along with bread, fried egg and slices of avocado in the Sandwich.

The new building location is beautiful and so throwback modern, great job.

The surrounding area has potential and is in the middle of older garfield neighborhood, when I was first looking for the restaurant, I thought this has to be wrong, but there it was.

Still one of my favorite places to go and eat. Glad you are back.
