OjnRf8yDGEBCoUDdchSViw Wow. This has got to be the best food truck experience I've had in Phoenix. As we walked through food truck Friday during First Fridays, we scoped out our options. We checked with Yelp and found this was highly rated. Best decision ever. Thank goodness Yelp warned us that each burrito was enormous because we almost each got our own. We decided to go with the fried catfish and jambalaya burrito and it was soooooo amazing. No lie, they were generous with the catfish and the jambalaya had some awesome sausage too. It came with a side of this amazing creole sauce and I needed more, it was so good. The staff was super friendly and asked for our feedback (which of course we told them it was delicious)!! I was definitely in pain due to fullness even though I shared it with Eric, but I just could not stop eating it! Can't wait to try other items on the menu but it'll be hard not getting the catfish burrito again!  The burrito was $8 but it was well worth it!
