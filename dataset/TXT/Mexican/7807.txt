_OoQ31fIoy3dK96rP6vtFQ Ordered the menudo and it was cooked perfectly and if if you have ever eaten menudo before you know what I'm talking about. The meat was prepared flawless and was delicious. They also had a side of cabbage finely chopped and I have never had that as a add in, it's usually onions, cilantro, and limes. The cabbage was a nice touch.

I seen a lot of plates pass by and the all looked delicious. Service was good as well.
