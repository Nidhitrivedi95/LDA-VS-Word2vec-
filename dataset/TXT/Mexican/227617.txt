S3qs5ZAZgqDvM88jj17hbQ Back in the days Carlos&Pepes was a great restaurant. But a couple of years ago they changes ownership and the place lost the prestige from back then. It used to be the spot back in the days. Plates were full all the time... You would never finish the plate. But NOW... MY GOD.... The increased the prices and they give less food that is bland, no taste whatsoever... I don't like 3 Amigos so I can't tell you to go there... I just have mexican food at Taco Bell, taste better then at Carlos seriously.... Sad cause that used to be my favorite spot. Chicken Chimichangas was the bomb back in the days....
