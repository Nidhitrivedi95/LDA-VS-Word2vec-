MQEpDvkdL39hh1N0We3Vaw My industry friends and I have been coming to Hot Taco for Taco Tuesday for about 2 months now. If it wasn't for my girl Lauren, we would have NEVER come back!!! The 2 times before this one, service has been LESS than poor. Both at the bar AND at a table. They had nasty attitudes, and took forever for EVERYTHING. Lauren W. is such an amazing server, we eaten our meal and had a round of drinks by the time we gotten our waters the last time we there before! Everything was delicious, she made time to talk to us, and got our drinks out in a flash!!! She's definitely a keeper!! A++++++
