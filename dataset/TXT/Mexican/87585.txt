dJR2vmBlydzsxR5P6BDFlQ I couldn't believe there was this good of food from a food court. The food was the most delicious food i'v had in a long time although being a little pricy. I had the original fish taco and classic grilled shrimp burrito and it didn't just taste good, It made me want to eat it again. That woman in the kitchen deserves a pay raise. Every Time i took a bite i could feel the heat of the fresh food straight off the grill and we still got our food at a decent time. I am definitely a lifelong customer of Rubio's!
