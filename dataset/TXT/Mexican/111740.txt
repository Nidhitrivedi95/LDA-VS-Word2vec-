G1lB2bUf1MT1FZT8TBy62g Total hole in the wall that you can pass by repeatedly and never even notice yet their tacos and nachos are amazing and definitely worth stopping for. When you are looking for great Mexican in the area of Nellis and Lake Mead-- this little shop definitely should be at the top of your list. Grab and go as the inside is more a fast food set up than a sit down diner-- and call ahead if you are craving tacos now.
