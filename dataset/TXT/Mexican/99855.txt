eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg This place has OK food but really bad customer service.  I got the fish tacos they where all right.  The waiter was rude when he asked if we wanted the check he said ill bring that and a police officer too.  I asked what he meant by that he was is just a joke.  Not a very good joke to me.  Oh and they add a 15 dollar gratuity tip when they dont even deserve it.
