wGSx98wpsI7dijynSNxR1A I've had the Carnitas Tacos twice here and they are really good! Second time round I had the hot sauce on them and that certainly left the mouth burning. I've also tried the Steak Tortas and that is really tasty too. Service is quick, and food is cheap. All the construction workers in the area use this truck and there is often a steady line of custom. Good little street food truck.
