i-Bu8g-y6fuLFAmLsGo0GQ This has fast become my favourite place. I absolutely love the food here. The service is exceptional. Ross the owner and his brother really let you know that your business is appreciated and that that your satisfaction is priority 1. 

I have tried the steak, pulled pork, and butter chicken, and Buffalo chicken burritos so far. All are great. The awesome one is the steak. The pulled pork is exceptional.  

They have 3 sizes of Burritos here. Even with my hearty appetite and an empty stomach, the medium aka "big" is more than enough to hold me over until the next day. I can't even imagine trying the large aka "huge"

I used to go out of my way to go to Burrito Boys, but because of their locations and my limited time I hardly went. This place more than makes up for it. The other burrito place in the neighbourhood is mucho bad. The service and quality of food there aren't even in the same ball park as Fat Bastard.
