XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg A worth it stop when in Vegas, heavy on southwestern flavors, you will enjoy Bobby Flay's menu ridiculously. His menu modernizes traditional southwestern dishes, pairing spicy and sweet wonderfully. 

Located in Caesar's Palace, the decor is modern and bright with reds & yellows and an upscale but comfortable, intimate atmosphere. Be prepared for a wait without a reservation.

Bread Basket: Several varieties of warm fresh breads. The blue corn jalapeno muffins were a hit with this guy. Asked the waiter to bring more ASAP. Munched heavily on the asiago jalapeno bread as well.

Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale: ($18) As the appetizer of the century I was more than happy to have ordered this. Shrimp was cooked lovely and dusted with spicy, sweet flavors. A warm, soft tamale wrapped up lime cilantro & a chipotle aioli. Nicely done sir, nicely done.

Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops: ($42) Decadent, fall off the bone lamb. The serrano chili sauce adds some warmth to the bite, without making you sweat. Not to overpower, a mint chimichurri adds a unique minty jalapeno aroma & character. 

I shall return.
