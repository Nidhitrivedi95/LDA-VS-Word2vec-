BdzJQypceJ5Bam2P7egoiw Poke bowls have become my go to for a light and tasty lunch. I have a couple of favorite stops, but the one closest to my work has a line out the door so I decided to try Mr. Poke today...it seemed to be a little busy (usually a good sign).

First, the young girl dishing out the protein scooped way too much rice in my bowl. Perhaps a good sign when it came to the protein? No. I decided to create my own bowl and asked for ahi tuna and salmon. The young girl scooped out a small portion of the ahi. Then, she scooped a smaller portion of the salmon. I should have said something or canceled my order at that point. I'm not kidding you...it was less than half of what you get at the majority of the other Poke restaurants. 

Second, you get to choose the mix-ins. There was a good selection, but you pay extra for cream cheese, avocado, mango, and seaweed salad. (I passed on those.) 

Third, the checkout was pretty easy.. my complaint? The cashier offered a punch card to the person in front of me but didn't offer me one. Maybe the look on my face while staring at the lack of protein told her I would not be back??

Taste...it was okay. If you read the other honest reviews, they comment that the tuna is warm. It's definitely room temperature. 

For the price, this does not compare to my other favorite stops. I will drive the extra two miles and stand in line. Better yet, I will start using the app at one of them so I can skip the line. 

Mr. Poke, there is a reason the competition has a line out the door. Hope the protein portions and other things improve. If they do, I may be back.
