VIJ2KiDKhUVhhpNylEIfog I love Mexican food, but for some reason had never tried food at maize. Finally, today I went to try this place with so many amazing reviews on Yelp. I ordered chicken fajita and guacamole & chips to go. The quantity of chicken fajita was enough for two people. Now, let's talk about the taste:
Chicken fajita(6/10): chicken was dry and bland in taste. However, veggies were nicely grilled and rice & beans also tasted fine. Tortillas were soft and warm.
Guacamole and chips(6/10): chips were crispy but guacamole was bland. I added a little lime and salt to it after which it tasted fine. It was served on a bed of lettuce which did not make any sense to me.
Complimentary salsa tasted really good.
Overall, I was not so happy with the food.
