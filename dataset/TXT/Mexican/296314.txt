zCmwErM82hdKl4L2UixDJw Goodness...I used to get take-out from this place almost every week for months, but recently the food seems to have gone down hill.

During my last visit my tacos had been carelessly thrown together with too much of each requested ingredient slopped and piled up within my taco. To top it all off..my meat was ICE COLD.

It was so disgusting that I immediately threw it all away. 

The time before that my take-out just seemed like they were PILING the ingredients in there...like MORE of everything was supposed to make me happy. Just because I checked off cabbage doesn't mean that I want a pile of cabbage in my damn taco. The flavors were comparable to someone dumping a cup of horseradish into a taco when it only required a teaspoon. JUST BAD.

Seriously only writing this review because I hope whoevers messing things up in the kitchen gets a training session =/
