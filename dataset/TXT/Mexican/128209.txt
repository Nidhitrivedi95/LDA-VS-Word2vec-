HyW8DBMowtmI6ZK4cr2ICA We stopped in for lunch on a Saturday after checking out all of the offerings on Main St. We initially passed it by due to the 3 star rating, but I'm so glad that we came back. The menu has a great variety of different things and it was difficult to make a decision. We settled on queso, mini crab cakes, pambazo and tres leches cake. Everything was great! Very fresh and we felt the portion sizes were perfect for lunch. The service was phenomenal! Both the hostess and our server were very welcoming and provided a wonderful experience. We will definitely be back!
