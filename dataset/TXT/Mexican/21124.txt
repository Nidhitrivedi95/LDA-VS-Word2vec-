2g4ZTD3ePNSbDAvh6qAOKQ Love this place.  We go there for the food . And the service . They do not have a bar , but it is OK. You still can have a great dinner at a very reasonable price. On the way home stop somewhere for a margarita . 
Love the tortas , their specialty . 
Great place to take people from out of town.
