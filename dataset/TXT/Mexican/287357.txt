ycZRyUBfitNEkV_AKTnjYg From the exterior the restaurant looks fine, but a completely different experience as soon as you step inside. Lights were dim, tables looked unsanitary. Despite the atmosphere, I placed my order for 3 chicken tacos. Came to a price of $7.50, definitely on the higher price for tacos. Based on the price I would have expected a bit more, but as they were making the tacos in front of me.

Taco shells were generic from a bag and reheated on the heat pan. The vegetables looked old and out of a bag. The lettuce was dry and discolored. Tomatoes were soggy. Chicken was precooked and may have been over re-heated making them dry. Overall taco experience wasn't the greatest. After finishing the tacos, I was worried for my health. Thankfully I didn't end up with any stomach problems. Will not be returning anytime soon.
