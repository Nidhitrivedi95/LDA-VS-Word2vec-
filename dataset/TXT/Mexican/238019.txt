sYUsL6Og4axZduPrJpdi0g This is an overpriced sham next to other burrito chains I visit. Not only does it cost more, with fewer options/varieties (except the noodles, which is random but yummy), and terrible tasting rubbery tiny shrimp, but the logo is incredibly racist and offensive! That alone brought my rating from 3* to 0.

Sauteed veggies option means sauteed green peppers. 

Nothing special, not worth the money.
