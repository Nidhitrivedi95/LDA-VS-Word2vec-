R1k-z3Mauqk4v-7ZeEVsHQ The chuleta de cerdo I had for lunch here was so delicious - one of the tastiest pork dishes I've ever had. It came with casamiento (beans mixed into rice), a simple salad, fried plantain, and two pupusas. I washed all these down with a cold horchata which had a stronger, more assertive flavor than the horchatas I've had in Mexican restaurants.  It was Easter Sunday when I had this lunch and though this combination was everyday fare, I thought that it was a meal tasty and spectacular enough for the holiday. 

A week and a half later, I came here with fellow yelpers for the monthly International Supper Club UYE. This time I decided to try distinctly Salvadoran dishes, so I ordered pupusa with cheese and loroco (flower buds of the loroco vine) and relleno de pacaya (made with the inflorescence of the pacaya palm tree). There was only the slightest hint of loroco flowers in the pupusas - a bit of a disappointment; the pupusas tasted good, but the lack of loroco flavor made it almost indistinguishable from a regular pupusa con queso. The relleno de pacaya turned out to be an acquired taste: it was definitely different, but the bitterness of the palm flower stalks was not something I really fancied. I enjoyed the "ensalada" beverage, which was a cold refreshing sweet drink with what seemed to me to be flavors of melon, apple, and citrus. Desert was atol de elote, which was something of a dessert soup with a sweet creamy "broth" and sweet corn kernels, with a sprinkling of cinnamon on top. It was pleasant and refreshing.

Five stars from the first visit, three stars for the second visit - that averages out to 4 stars for my experience here.
