TxQBdyDktZSk1KVTWh71dw Be careful with pineapple Margarita!!  Wife got one.  Drink tasted only like sour mix   Not much alcohol.  One lil pineapple cube.  THEN she ate pineapple-WOW.  It hit her like 2 shots.  (Doing this on an empty stomach does not help.)  We asked.  The pineapple tequila infused for 2 weeks.  (Read fine print on menu.)  I had TC tea.  Meh.
Server Adam.  Dropped off his card.
Food:  Guac table side.  Very good. Sun dried tomatoes added nice touch.  Disappointed our chips seemed like they were leftovers from bottom of box. Not much size to him. Lil chips.  After using up big ones, mixed chips wit guac.  We did get more from server.
Tried small cheesy grits ball. Meh.  Very heavy.   Bland.  Did not even finish 1/2.
Fierce Shrimp.  Very good.  Medium sized.  Good crust.  Good portion. Flavorful.  Spicy-but not too hot or overbearing.  Slaw included meh.
Shrimp n Grits.  Disappointing.  4 shrimp. One was not cleaned all the way, still had shell and legs on it.  Good size shrimp.  Flavorful. Tasty. Sauce and toppings OK.  Grits were same cheesy ball we tried earlier.  HEV-ee.  2 pcs of toast. Did not finish.  (Adam said he had a customer from New Orleans who said Babalu shrimp n grits were better than she gets from there.  Either the lady has really low, low, expectations.  Or Adam lied.  I believe second.)
When done felt heavy.  Loaded.
Staff all seemed nice.  A few small hiccups. New place.  New people.  Will work things out.  Parking, Valet parking.  Fills up quick.  Parkers nice guys.  We had them check wait time before parking.  They did.  Appreciate it guys.
Looking forward to repeating.  Lighter fare.
I wonder if 3 Stooges will still be playing on big screens all over in there.  We like those guys.
