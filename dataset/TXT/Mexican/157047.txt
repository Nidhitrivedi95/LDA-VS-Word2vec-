Kj8rXSpMQlFOP2iWN0fXYA I was really skeptical coming to this restaurant because there were only 5 reviews. 

The interior seating reminds me of some of the local restaurants in Mexico. Brings back joyful memories and a sense of comfort.  
The host was friendly and welcoming. Our waitress was very nice and helpful with the menu. 

I ordered the chicken mole which was tasted fresh and delicious! My wife had a mini-chimichanga with shredded chicken. She also enjoyed the food. My 5-year old son ate his rice and beans. He doesn't normally eat well at restaurants if he doesn't like the food. He loved it!

They also have a full bar with 2 flat screens hanging at both ends.

The service and food here is excellent and I am definitely coming here more often. 

5 stars!
