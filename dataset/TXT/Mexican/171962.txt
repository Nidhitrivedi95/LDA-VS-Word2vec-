MAuSh7NKoT__CQ4BumoayA Love T$T. Dined here last night with three dinner companions. Prompt seating, prompt service. Excellent, well-seasoned food and an attentive, cheerful server. I had their fish tacos - you can choose grilled or fried fish. I chose grilled, and the fish was perfectly cooked. Needed a squeeze of lime, which the server quickly brought. I'm not a big fan of black beans in general, but their refried black beans were very tasty and a good complement to the Mexican rice. Everyone at the table was impressed with their dinner choices. Very reasonably priced for a Strip restaurant. Definitely returning!
