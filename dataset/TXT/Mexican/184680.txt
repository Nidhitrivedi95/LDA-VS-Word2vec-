nsEO3MRzYLKfgtID7gvArw I like this place I mean it's not the greatest food not the greatest service but it's different just not your normal Taco Burrito enchilada place just a different style which is kind of nice because everyone's the same thing now for the food I had the shrimp soup pretty much can't remember name of it but it was shrimp rice vegetables and like a tomato sauce very good full flavor but freaking boiling hot so watch out and get a side of their grilled or fried jalapenos so delicious definitely will be back
