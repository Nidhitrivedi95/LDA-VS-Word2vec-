CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q This place gets a lot of hype for the quality of their meat and flavor and they do deliver. Last time I went I had tacos that were soaked and tortillas were soaked too. It was good flavor I can't complain. I've gone a couple times and I hadn't had that problem. Expect long lines during lunch and dinner times but the staff is always cool and friendly. 
I like the straightforwardness about Tacos el Gordo. I appreciate that they keep it simple and flavorful. 
My coworker told me to try asking for fresh avocados on my tacos and it was worth it.
