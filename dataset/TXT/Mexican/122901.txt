hgrbo2EvuhDiKvFObqe1wA Just meh. I went for a diablito because I didnt want to drive to 59th ave  & McDowell. What I got cannot even compare to what I usually get at other places. The ice was like chips and there wasn't cacahuates or all the other mexican candies. I can't speak on any other menu items, but I probably wouldn't return considering there are water and ice and raspado places all over the city.
