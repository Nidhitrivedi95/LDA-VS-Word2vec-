CUUcLheYIxjO643azprFxA El Paso used to be my favorite local Mexican place.  When they first opened, and for the few years following, the guacamole was fresh, the food was consistently good and you always knew what you were getting, and the people who worked there were attentive and nice.  I went a couple months ago and was astonished with its decline.  I decided to go the other day to give it another try, and was even more disappointed.  Everything tastes like it came out of a can.  The guacamole definitely came out of a bag, the salsa was "meh" at best, and the quesadilla was no longer spectacular.  I used to go there just to get a quesadilla, so to get what I got this time in comparison was just sad.  And to top it all off, the guy who waited on us has been there the longest of all of them, and seemed so thrilled (sarcasm font) to still be working there.  He threw our drinks on the table AS he was walking away, was mostly silent when taking our order, threw our food on the table AS he was walking away again, didn't ask how anything was, and just gave us our check.  It's sad because it used to be so good; the new murals on the walls aren't even finished, but alas, I will not be back to see the finished product.  If Taco Bell is better than you, you're doing something wrong.
