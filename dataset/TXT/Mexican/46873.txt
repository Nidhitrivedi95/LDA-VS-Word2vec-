7tdVsSDXRKtLLC-fD1hJ-A Took out of town guests.  Service was good.  The chips and the cheese crisp were amazing.  HOWEVER I ordered carnitas...I have never had such dry and tasteless carnitas.  They were able to get me something else...Burrito, taco and tostada.  The taco meat was super duper salty.  I brought most of it home and ending up throwing it away.  I didn't want to waste the calories on bad mexican food.
They service was good and attentive.  Just sad about my meal.
