409qhf4RF0rlxcuaM576Qg Food hasn't been bad.  Always hot at the least.  People seem friendly for the most part.  But I must say, this location hasn't been holding up to the same standards.  They consistently forget the little things like my salsa.  Also, food quality has been lacking a few times as of today.  My chicken came out over cooked on the thighs.  Still love el pollo, but needs improvements.
