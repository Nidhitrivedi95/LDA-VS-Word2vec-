QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA Many people come in and out of our lives every day. But some people you never forget. 

Javony is one of those people.  As we walked in, it was hard to miss his presence in the room. He was teaching an impromptu salsa class to a bachelorette party while chatting up a nearby table of WWII Purple Heart veterans, impressing them with his deep knowledge of twentieth century post-war geopolitics. At the same time he was calmly performing the heimlich on an over excited frat boy. All smiles, casually exuding Bill Clinton levels of charisma, Javony welcomed us to Nacho Daddy™. 

The conversation zigged and zagged between unconscious bias, the Syrian refugee crisis, Chinese calligraphy, and his recent paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine. His fresh take on tired issues reinvigorated my views and forced me to question everything I knew. The hours flew by - as I felt the conflicts between mind, soul, and body melt away in his calming presence. 

Javony would never say this himself but following his double stint in the peace corps (Malawi and Haiti) he donated both kidneys (and two thirds of his liver) to a baby panda.

Having passively made millions in Silicon Valley selling his car safety algorithm to Tesla (saving millions of future lives), Jovany decided that with all options ahead of him and no need to work a day in his life, he would help people from all over the world find their true selves. What better place to do that than Nacho Daddy™ Las Vegas - the veritable crossroads of human civilization (try the queso it's like making out with Buddha Jesus and Moses at the same time).

I can only hope you, too, can share even a moment, a glance, a thought, a smile, or a margarita with Jovany at Nacho Daddy™ - a professional human being.
