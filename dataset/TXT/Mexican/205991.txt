PYRjVUmJgctHVRnBVXpBEw I don't normally go in on a place and give negative reviews, but today is the day!I would have loved to have given a review on the food this place, if I ever received it! I promise I stood at the front waiting to be seated and at least spoken to by the hostess for seven minutes without a single word or acknowledgement. The only reason why I stood there so long was because I was watching a livestream on my phone. She helped another woman, which was fine, but I never received even a single acknowledgment of my presence. Thankfully there are several other excellent Mexican restaurants in this ZIP code where I live. This place will never get my business.
