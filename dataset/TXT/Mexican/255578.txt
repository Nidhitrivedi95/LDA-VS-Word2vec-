vCopginiBsz1STNhQPb8XA I don't know why some gave this place bad reviews. I think the food is creative (and gets more creative every time I go) and very tasty. For reviewers who said the food was flavorless, I wonder what sort of restaurants they go to. Either that or my taste-buds are broken (or theirs are, so they need 5 times more spices than everyone else).

I think it's nice that the menu includes some fake meats. I gave up meat for different reasons, but I do like having fake meats once in a while, especially if I'm craving it. So even if those dishes aren't the most creative, it's a great thing to have for people who miss meat (or non-vegas/non-vegetarians).

I've had their lavender cake, fibbish and chips, various salads, soups, spaghetti/meatballs, and their "random creations" specials only for valentine's day. I liked everything I had.

I have NOT tried anything with vegan cheese yet. All vegan cheeses I've tried elsewhere taste like sour feet, so I'm hesitant on getting one of the dishes containing vegan cheese - mostly because it'll be a waste of the dish if I can finish it and because it's a little expensive. I'll try it one of these days though.
