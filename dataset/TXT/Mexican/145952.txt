jIzygnVmajEXYmfsBNY_Gw This place has  awesome customer service, and decor. I love that they let you sample every single meat before you order. Most of the meat was very flavorful,  there was only one that was a bit dry.
..I think the pork.

Anyhow, I ordered a spicy chicken burrito and a torta. The burrito was GIGANTIC! The torta was regular in size. The only downside was both the burrito amd the torta were a bit soggy when I sat down to eat. I'm blaming this on all of the ingredients.  The second downside can't be blamed on the restaurant at all but my friend and I had a gas attack and he's still on the lou haha. I guess that's a tip...take some beano first if your stomach is a bit on the sensitive side.
