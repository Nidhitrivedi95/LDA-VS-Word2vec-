PF6IipxqHx0i2cFBAraXPw I tried this place for the first time last week and I thought it was pretty good. It is like Chipotle where you walk down in a line and pick out what you want in your burrito, taco, quesidilla, etc. I thought Cafe Rio had a more authentic Mexican taste. The portion is pretty big and it comes with pico de gallo. 

I got the burrito and would recommend that. You see them making the tortillas and they are pretty thick. I liked it. You can get the burrito enchilada style or just plain.

There are a lot of seats inside. This place is like a grab and go type of place. It is not a waiter restaurant. I would recommend this place to other people.
