-o082vExIs0VVNSuZmiTQA What a great place!!  We went Saturday at 11 am when it first opened and sat on the patio at the bar. We were the first customers there. It soon filled up. Great atmosphere. 

The food was excellent I had the number five my husband had the number eight. We both loved our meals.

The service was excellent.   So happy we found this place.
