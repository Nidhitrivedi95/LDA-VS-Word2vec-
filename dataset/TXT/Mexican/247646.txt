U_jPOTd-Z5KATbTYnDeNxg My friend and I have been coming here for years and today made the decision to stop. Chicken burrito was both tasteless and the meat tasted cheap. Friends quesadilla was steak and it was super chewy and the texture seemed like it was over cooked and then reheated several times. They need to reevaluate the cooking or maybe they changed the supplier of their meats? Either way not too happy :(
