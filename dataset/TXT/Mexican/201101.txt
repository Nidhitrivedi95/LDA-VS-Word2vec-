phIL-dJoT8uztbdFgfk_3w Identical to the Queensway location.  Not quite as generous with the toppings, but the "lil" size is still plenty big enough.  Although, I had to ask for more beans on mine, and at first the server said no, quoting the reason as me having ordered the 'lil.  So I had to point out that I had ordered the bean and cheese burrito - it was definitely deserving of more beans.  When she realized what I had ordered, she agreed and happily obliged.

No stools or chairs yet - just a few cruiser tables...  so we took ours to go.  Place seems clean.  Customer service was sort of dismal.   I'm sure they'll make a killing on the lunch crowd though!  And if they stay open late, they'll be busy for the after the bar crowd too.
