Rj-7ymdw8aNZBRqGRAjR3Q Great food, guacamole is THE BEST!!!! You can order it mild, medium, or spicy. If you order tacos you can prep your own with the amount of meat you want in it. Bottomless chips and salsa, Primera Margarita was refreshing and light (you can get a lil toasty from it). 
Neat atmosphere, very dimly lite - bust out your flashlight on your phones when coming in the evening. Great place to entertain definitely will be coming back.
Our server Rachel was very attentive and personable, she made our dinner and experience fun and memorable. Love her!!!
