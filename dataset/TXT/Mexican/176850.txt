MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA Pretty good tacos.  I've lived in Cuidad de Mexico, D.F. for a couple of months and am quite familiar with good mexican cuisine, both street and high-end, having eaten out pretty much every day, at least a couple of times per day.  

Are the tacos here authentic mexican? Well, not really, but then every city in Mexico (and even every place) has their own style. They are pretty good here, though.  

I went for lunch, but there were no lunch combos, and the lunch menu was quite pricey for what it offers (and for being in Parkdale, one of the last ghettos in the City of Toronto).  I had the Baja Fish Taco and Pork Tinga Tostada, both smallish portions, didn't fill me up (and I am not a big guy), and it cost me around $19 with tip.  Fish was juicy and good, taco shells were soft and tiny, pork tostada had more lettuce than pork, but it was tasty.

Again, an overhyped place, judging by the hipsters here gushing about the food (probably never been to Mexico proper), good food, not mind-boggling, and somewhat overpriced for what you get and where it is.

On a lighter note, I thought the service was pretty good, no attitude or bad vibes (although I was growled at when I got into the kitchen instead turning right for the patio, but that's to be expected).
