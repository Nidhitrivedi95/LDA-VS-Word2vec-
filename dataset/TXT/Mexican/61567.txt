aTvmLm3YfTs_L290fEolEw Came in with my daughter and we both ordered a Bowl, which is $5.99, at 2:30pm. We didn't know that there are two different bowls, which is what I thought we were ordering. The Perfecto Bowl, is a half order. I get to the register and they've charged me for a regular bowl. No one ever asked me to clarify what type of bowl. They just charged me for the regular bowl, charged me, and when I said I thought it was $5.99, only then did she explain that there's a difference. The difference is not super obvious either. Just felt that they shouldn't have charged me for the regular bowl, as I indicated that wasn't what I thought I was ordering, if they want to keep a customer. Never going back.
