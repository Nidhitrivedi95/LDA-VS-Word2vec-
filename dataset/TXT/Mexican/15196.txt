1_y5e1u-o93EKOigXgR3LQ This has become my favourite taco place. They offer 6 different options and all are delicious. They have just the right ratio of meat to veg and for the indecisive, the 3 for $10 option is perfect. 

The location is small and only allows for counter seating for about 6 people, so if you come on a busy Friday night, plan on take out, or you may be waiting a while to get a seat. 

Looking for fast, delicious and budget friendly? This is the place!
