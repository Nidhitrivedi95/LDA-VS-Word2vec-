fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg Upon approaching this sacred haven of magical Mexican food my friends and I were already trembling in anticipation. The line was long, but no battle has been won without immense courage and perseverance. We bravely forged on and patiently waited for our tickets to fLaVoRtOwN ¡¡¡

Luckily the wait was not long, for our gullets yearned to be filled with Trash Can Nachos (tm). We screamed for Guy Fieri's grace and grease to rain down upon us and when he unleashed it onto us, we were not disappointed. FINALLY we were given the golden ticket into the pearly gates of "CHANGA'D" burritos and BORRACHO PLATTERS. 

We began with tequila (NECTAR OF LOS DIOSES) and shared a trashcan full of delicious nachos that gooed everywhere. Our server Liz was amazing. She made sure all of our FLaVoRtOwN dreams came true and never let us down. 

Deep fried burritos were devoured, dreams were realized, and some hopes for our futures might have been compromised for this spicy experience, but we are so glad we came. It was worth it. IT WAS ALL WORTH IT. 5/5 would hang loose here again.
