dGb8W42bi3ecRGK_I7pk0Q Yaah! you get your first three margaritas for 99 cents! Do you know why you have to pay full price for your fourth margarita? That's because they have to now use their second ounce of tequila! I had three margaritas and had less of a buzz than if I had a slice of rum cake! Do you know why the first three margaritas are 99 cents? They need something to attract customers into the place because the food on its own will not do the trick. Start with the chips- mine had a burnt taste and  were so salty I could feel my skin cells begin to shrivel up. The salsa had the consistency of tomato juice- not a single chunk of anything- no onions, jalapeño or tomatoes- the only way to eat the salsa is to find a concave chip- otherwise you get no salsa- just a damp chip! Moving on to the carnitas- there a very few things in my life that are worth living for- and good carnitas is one of them. If the carnitas I had tonight were the best I could ever get then Lord- you might as well take me now! Some chunks of pork were well seasoned and moist and some were so dried out that they broke apart like dog biscuits when I stuck my fork in them. It's like they took the left over chunks from lunch put them under a heat lamp for five hours then mixed them in with the fresh batch cooked for the dinner crowd! How can half  an entree be so good and the other half be so stale? What saves this rating from getting a two star review is the service- not a lot of friendliness but prompt and got my order right as well as the check. Also the atmosphere is upbeat colorful and clean. Finally the prices are reasonable. I only recommend this place if you want a cheap meal, don't want to drive far, are staying at the hotel across the street and do not have a car and you want a 99 cent margarita that was only introduced to tequila. Otherwise - keep driving. My fellow Yelpers for the most part got it right- this is a solid three star place!
