Each and every time I've come into this location I've received excellent customer service, which I can't say for most of the other Chipotle locations I've eaten at. My boyfriend went to this location a week or so ago to grab lunch for me, and one of the employees behind the counter was singing a song from the Lion King. My boyfriend joined in singing the song with him and so they gave him our lunch for free! I came in on my lunch break today for a burrito bowl and after I had grabbed my card out to hand to the cashier, he told me he was actually going to comp my meal! The free food on those couple occasions were a great surprise, but even aside from that, every experience here has been fantastic. On one of my visits I witnessed a girl who was coming in for an interview, and the employee she spoke to told her it would be a few minutes and offered her a complimentary drink. The management and staff at this location are doing an incredible job and it's refreshing to see a "fast food" restaurant have 10/10 service.
