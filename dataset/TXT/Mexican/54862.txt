9vub2LM7Djy8P-LPumcLXA Came here to try some tacos based on some Yelp recommendations. 
Located off McDowell in Phoenix, and not difficult to miss with good signage.  Parking lot is limited and small, and I didn't see any other alternatives if the lot was full.  The restaurant does offer drive through service.  The inside of the restaurant is also on the small side (-1).  If the place was full, I'm not sure where one would eat if they were dining in. 
Staff were friendly and helpful with menu items and ordering.  The menu was conveniently located above the cashier and on the table by the cashier. The one on the table offered more explanations of the menu items versus the menu above. 
I ordered three tacos and, sadly, they were very underwhelming - very small and under filled (-1).  It simply wasn't filling to consume just those 3 tacos for dinner.  The filling for the tacos also appeared uninspiring and very dry.  Don't get me wrong, the tacos were tasty.  The sauce station was not as varied or extensive as I've seen at some other places.
Probably won't return based on my dissatisfaction with their tacos.
