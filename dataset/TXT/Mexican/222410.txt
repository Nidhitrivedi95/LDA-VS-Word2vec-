RRtjC-KUE9vSbD09r6is2A It was enduring the bitter cold of Chicago for the past three months that pulled me to this place. Driving along Scottsdale road to the hotel, I saw happy, tanned patrons drinking magaritas and eating guacamole - OUTSIDE! Really, the restaurant could've been called "Salty Turds" and the fact that there was a patio that I could sit on in the middle of February would have been enough for me. 

The patio was packed at 6pm but the hostess was really great about keeping a lookout for a table and before we could finish our Coronas, we had a small table for two. The food was just okay. It didn't wow me, but I wasn't spitting it out in my napkin either. I was only in town for the weekend, and with so many cute places around Scottsdale, I wish I would've resisted the allure of the first patio I laid eyes upon and tried a place that would have food to match the ambiance.
