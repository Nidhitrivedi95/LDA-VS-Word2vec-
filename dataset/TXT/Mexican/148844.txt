JsCKeWHA8n_5mFQ3F6t4UA I've eaten at this restaurant before and have been pleased.  I do not care for their salsa, but the entrees have been great.  We had our first one star experience this week.  Because of our past experience I gave them an extra star.  

This time the food was poorly prepared, over cooked and dry.  It was expensive too.  I don't mind paying a lot for great food.  I'm not going back.  There are too many similar places that are much better.
