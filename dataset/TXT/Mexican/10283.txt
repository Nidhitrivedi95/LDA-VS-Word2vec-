_XN-GwzZwAyIqLKJsl2htg I was expecting better and as such was disappointed. 

The good news was our waiter was terrific; helpful, attentive and generally a warm fellow. The food ranged from good to poor. The items that were prepared at the sushi bar were all fresh, interesting and tasty. The items that were prepared in the "kitchen" were mediocre to bad. 

There appears to be no attention to detail with the hot items from the kitchen. The chicken tacos of $15 were dry, bland and frankly an embarrassment. The Vietnamese beef dish was marginal at best. The vegetables were cooked fresh but the beef was dry and seemed like it was cooked well before the meal was assembled. 

The place was VERY load and full of groups of women that spent all their time either taking pictures of each other or looking at their phones. I have never seen so many groups of women at a restaurant at one time; it was clearly a "seen and be seen place" where they are selling an atmosphere and food quality is second to providing a "hip" social environment. 

In summary; the food is OK but very overpriced, the atmosphere is unique but very load and the attention to detail is poor. I doubt that I will go back.
