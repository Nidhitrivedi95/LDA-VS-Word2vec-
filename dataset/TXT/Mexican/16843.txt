I get that Friday nights are busy, but you can't be so rushed to get to other people that you're demanding answers to questions that you've interrupted me answering multiple times. I felt like I was getting barked at while trying to order. When I said "you're being really curt and cutting me off" he said "ok" and hung up. 

Management needs to either hire people who can handle a busy Friday night, or train them to be able to handle it. 

I'll be going somewhere else tonight.
