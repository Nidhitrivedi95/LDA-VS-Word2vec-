kXl44keW3wZaJpjEqHk30g Vegan options at fast food restaurants are scarce, if existent at all, so when I found out online that their garden burger was vegan I was intrigued. 

Just as a precaution, when ordering, I asked the young man taking my order if this veggie burger was in fact egg and dairy free, to which he didn't know but he promptly asked a manager, who went in the back to read the ingredients for me with no hesitation! How cool is that? Sometimes I get the most sour reactions when I ask questions like that but these employees seemed to actually care about my inquiry and wanted to give me an honest response. Kudos farmer boys! 

I got the veggie burger and it was delicious! Even my meat eater boyfriend thought it was tasty. Boyfriend also loved his food, but he always loves his food from farmer boys. 

Environment is inviting and clean, service was excellent (I mean they actually bring your food to you and take your plates when you're done!!) food came out quick (but not too quick you know?) 

I will definitely be back.
