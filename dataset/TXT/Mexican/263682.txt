w761Gs5wswaiKRNq0IpA7w Fat Bastard is providing us with a great food option when you consider other choices in the neighborhood. The "burritos" are large, not too expensive, and filled with lots of meat and seeming fresh ingredients. The staff is friendly and the place is clean.
     However the only thing Mexican in this place is the Jumex in the fridge. As with most burrito places in Toronto, they are on their own path as far as how to put a burrito together. They have some taste, but it's a far cry from what a true burrito should taste like. How you can make a burrito without  freshly made salsa is just nonsense....right there your pulling garlic, onion, and cilantro from the mix! Continuing with the Toronto process they are using cheddar cheese as well as putting your fully prepared burrito on a hot grill to heat it up. I'm sorry but if the meat, beans, and rice are hot and you steam the tortilla to melt the cheese your all set. It's takes 1/4 of the time and who wants to eat hot guacamole wrapped in a hard tortilla. I see all of this as a lack of vision on the behalf of the owners. A small investment in traveling to California and visiting Taquerias in L.A., and San Francisco's Mission district or any other neighborhood in S.F. would provide Toronto with a invaluable injection of culture and great food. 
    All that said I will be back to Fat Bastard, as it is good food at a great price. I only hope that they expand their options to include more authentic ingredients, until then I'll tell myself that I'm eating a really good wrap.
