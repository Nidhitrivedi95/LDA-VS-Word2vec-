OdLYPceRdj07gC378sruMw This relatively new Taco Bell sets the bar for fast food experiences.  I often stop there after a late night out and it's always a good experience.  All of the people working the window are friendly and patient (especially when the car full of drunk idiots ahead of me orders $100 in food).  The cashier is quick and efficient, and the food usually appears fast.  

I often put in special orders there (hold this, add that, etc).  They are never rude about it and my orders are always right.  The food, especially for a Taco Bell, is really good.  Everything is made quick and is as tasty as you'd expect.  My only (teeny-tiny) issue with his restaurant is that they advertise being open 24 hours on the weekend but the often turn off the griller around 5am when I cruise in after a long night of poker downtown.  Still, on the whole an excellent fast food stop in West Park.
