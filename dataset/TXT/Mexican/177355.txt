ms7cmWkPiSBDTnz-1sv2kQ A really slick loungey-type place that was a bit underwhelming.  Been there a couple of times - once for dinner on a weeknight, and once for drinks on a weekend night.   Drinks and bar snacks are a better experience.  They have some corn crusted waffle fries that blow Chick-fil-A away.  

The dinner however left a bit to be desired.  I mean, they used tortilla chips from Safeway, and couldn't substitute their pinto beans for black beans.  What kind of Latin restaurant is this??  

Also, the chicken torta was extremely greasy and gave me the burps the rest of the night.  And I'm not one with a sensitive stomach so it caught me by surprise.  

The vibe, drinks and service were great, but don't go for the food.  The "Latin inspired"  food is disappointing for Phoenix.  Our bartendress was superb.  If anything, go for the service, the drinks and the digs!
