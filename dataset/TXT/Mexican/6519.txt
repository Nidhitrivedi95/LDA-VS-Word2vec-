_Gl7RqOkCUQr8kjN8yGf6w This place is called Pappasito's now, so I'm not sure why it's still listed as Burrito Gordito here.

Anyway, I'll always have a soft spot for this location since it was here that Burrito Boyz was born all those years ago. It's changed hands quite a few times since then and Pappasito's is its latest iteration.

I had purchased a Groupon, so I arrived at lunch to take advantage. The woman taking my order seemed utterly baffled by my voucher and spent almost five minutes trying to figure out how to redeem it. The line behind me kept growing and I was getting angrier (and more embarrassed) by the minute. If you don't have a system in place to seamlessly accept a Groupon, maybe you shouldn't be *offering* Groupons.

I digress. I ordered the pulled pork burrito and was asked if I wanted everything on it. (Of course I do!) I received the finished burrito a few minutes later and took it outside to eat.

My first observation was that the burrito had been made using a whole wheat tortilla, even though I wasn't asked if I wanted white or whole wheat. Why would you *default* to the whole wheat? Nobody likes whole wheat! And making things worse, this particular tortilla was stale, so it really stood out like a sore thumb with each bite.

The filling contained in this thoroughly disappointing 'rito was fine, I guess, although I have to say the pulled pork was extremely underwhelming. It had no real flavor and the texture was akin to a wet paper towel.

With this kind of lackluster service and subpar food, I can't imagine Pappasito's will survive too much longer in this neighborhood, given its close proximity to Burrito Boyz, Fat Bastard, and even Smoke's.
