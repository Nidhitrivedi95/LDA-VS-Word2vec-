xEBor41OFpeeKdcCZ2sfMg went here on Saturday night and it was fairly busy. We had a large party, and the service was so great. I don't remember his name unfortunately, but he was super friendly and attentive. I had a margarita and it was delicious. For the meal I had the mole chicken enchiladas and they were also delicious. Everyone in our group really enjoyed the food and the service. The chips and salsa were on point. Salsa had a little bit of a kick and the tortilla chips were warm and crunchy. The portions were also huge. Had plenty of left overs. We will definitely be back!
