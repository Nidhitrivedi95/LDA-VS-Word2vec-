EUxbuNT8BYPs_h0vVMy2pg Believe the hype, the food is awesome. The tacos are small but so flavorful and perfect for the price. I could eat the carnitas everyday. The staff is very friendly and helpful when I can't make up my mind. My favorite place when I need a taco fix.  Go early and avoid the crowds
