QrTg1ZaKcaJj2fzXQmHFXQ I've been here zillionth of times, however, it never came to my mind to eat in there; why would it be?

I'm always pro to indulge, so I wouldn't care to have a taco while they charge me the groceries. Now that I'm thinking about it, I realize the reason is: the smell hasn't been appealing or evident. When they are cooking good food you salivate, turns out you want a piece of that.

With the groceries I have encounter feelings. I know they are successful hard workers trying to consolidate their brand. For my rustic taste, the cinnamon, hierba santa, mole, epazote, orégano, and the rest of authentic Mexican ingredients look way too fancy on those perfectly sealed bags. Standing in front gives me the sensation of being in a commercial with  scenography you wouldn't find in Mexico (I rather the bulk containers and the smells of spices).

It would be cool for the stores to have the tortillas machine rolling up with hot-freshly made tortillas, being asked if I want 1/2kilo-1 kilo with paper, or without... But I know I'm nostalgic of how a real tortillería works in Mexico.
