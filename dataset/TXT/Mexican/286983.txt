yb7ZtgMWSZboG_sSUx9g2A Went for lunch and wanted to be thrilled but it was at best average. The good parts were the family, their son was learning how to run the front of house and for being a kid, he did a great job. The prices were super reasonable. The wait time for food prep was just fine. The quality was good and flavor was delicious. Everything was fresh and even though the menu was small, the variety was good.
Now for the average part. The authentic prep is somewhat lacking in that the tacos come with absolutely nothing but meat and tortilla. The salsa bar was not stocked well and the salsas were all extremely spicy hot. I like spice and this was way spicier than I cared for. We ordered some chips as a side and had nothing to dip them in. Asked if they had something more mild and they didn't. Overall, we were a bit disappointed from the other YELP reviews because we really expected this to be a hidden Mexican gem and it really wasn't.
