JECKrOvqJ_faoW_QxyeEAw I kind of feel like im in a walmart commercial slashing stars, with this place. We have been there a few times and i know I gave it 2 stars the first time i reviewed it and since then we have been there a few more times and they have seemed to mess up our order every time we have been there. I have wanted to remove a star but the nicer side of me said no. Well to hell with being kind after this last trip. We ordered an order of the shredded beef nachos with the jallepenos on the side and when we got home we cracked open this styrofoam box of goodness... BUT NOPE.. We opened up to a box of Carne asada nachos with more jallepenos then I think I have ever seen on an order of nachos. I love jallepenos, the wife doesn't and they can always be picked off but  my main gripe is that they have managed to screw up our order 4 times in a row now. Come on Jeffe, make it happen. If i come back.
