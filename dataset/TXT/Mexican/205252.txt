Pw06ajii6di7QHYpj6IgkQ I've been here a couple times when I want to grab a bite on the way to the cottage. This place always looks pretty clean but all the times I've eaten here it was a ghost town. Maybe 1 or 2 customers come in. I don't mind because I get my food that much faster!

I really love how they have different options in sizing for their burritos! I've always felt it was a waste when I don't finish a burrito I've gotten at other places. They have various options for their menu from the meat, to the style, and the filling! When they roll it all up, they put it on a grill press to heat it up a bit. I'm not always the biggest fan of grilled burritos but I honestly don't have any complaints. This will definitely be a go to place to eat for a quick bite on the way to or from the cottage.
