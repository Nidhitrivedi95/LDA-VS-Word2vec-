Chipotle packs a lot of calories in one meal so that made it the perfect 7 hour traveling time pre-flight meal! At noon it was packed with business men on their lunch break and hungry Pittsburgh folks.

This isn't what I would call authentic Mexican food but this is still REALLY GOOD.  You can get burritos, burrito bowls, hard or soft tacos, and a quesadilla (for vegetarians).

The BURRITO BOWL is my favorite thing to get because it's basically everything inside a burrito, without the tortilla! Cilantro lime rice, spicy marinated steak, black beans, cheese, lettuce, mild tomato salsa, sour cream, and guacamole (extra cost) is my suggestion! Sometimes you're just in the mood for a good fatty burrito.  Got Guac all over my face every time I tired to take a bite, but that's just how large the burrito was :)
