Wc9UpJhOcdSj7olZkz7SJA Everything about this place was 5 star. From the service, ambiance, burger, fries and shake. I ordered the standard with cheese, bacon and grilled onions with fries and a dulche milk shake. The cheeseburger to butter bun ratio was perfect with the stand sauce just made it even better. The fries were cooked perfectly crispy and the stand sauce it came with for dipping added great flavor. The shake was creamy and deliciously smooth. My wife had the strawberry lemonade and she said it was one of the best she's had.
