-bMZCfTK7fxFaURynKpBMA Mariachis on a Friday night is the perfect compliment to the fine Mexican seafood cuisine! Seriously. Try the molcajete.  Mouthwatering goodness.   Their rice and beans are delicious not bad for the basics of Mexican cuisine.  The sea bass here is fluffy and crisp of fried. Yummy all around.  Great food. Great service.  Can't go wrong here.
