The quesadilla was made with American cheese and had a slice melted on top even.... yuck. It was just cheese and chorizo, I am used there being crema, quest fresco, and sometimes some veggies as well when getting a real authentic quesadilla.  The tamale wad ok. The chicken was a bit dry, and the sauce it was in had no flavor. The tamale itself was a but large and the corn part in some spots was a bit thick.
