iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg Oh my yum, my boss just brought these tacos in for my team for lunch and holy heck let me just say these tacos are AMAZING! My review is based solely on my consumption of the fried mahi mahi taco and the reactions of my colleagues, which were rather expressive. 

The mahi mahi was the perfect consistency and texture - firm and flaky, and full of flavour without tasting fishy. To be honest, I had never really had fish tacos before this and I am now officially on team fish taco. Sign me up. This is a winning team. World series here I come.

I'm not actually sure how much these tacos cost but apparently they're quite affordable. Regardless, I know next time I'm in kensington I'll find it impossible to walk past Seven Lives without grabbing me a mahi mahi. Folks say that's not even the best thing on the menu, but I don't even know how I'll try anything else when the mahi mahi was so yummy yummy.
