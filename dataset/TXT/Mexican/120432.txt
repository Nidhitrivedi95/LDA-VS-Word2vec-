GzBIAjAMHD9iVZK8BT6XMw Usually only come down this way for First Friday, I was pleasantly surprised to find a place opened only for breakfast/brunch hours. After seeing the freshly pressed corn tortillas photo, I knew I needed to make the trip down to check it out. I ordered the breakfast plate with rice, pinto beans, cotija cheese and their medium chile verde sauce. The sauce was so good and flavorful!  The coffee was a really robust Guatemalan roast and I really enjoyed the self serve coffee bar. 

The decor was nice inside and I would like to go back again when it's not so hot to sit on the patio. Tyler was very helpful explaining the menu and getting us situated. Only giving 4 stars because the bacon was tough. The rest of the food and service was great. Will definitely come back again to try the tacos next.
