BEplfZTUzYwApjMUaOA12w The best thing about this restaurant is the location. It's very relaxing watching and listening to the gondolas. But the food here is not very good. They say Mexico City cuisine but it's not even close. It's more like a cross between Mexico City cuisine meets American meets Tex mex. The food temperature was almost cold or barley warm. One person in our group is a vegetarian so as part of the 3 dishes he ordered, one was a Cobb salad minus the bacon. Their version is spinach with some shaved cheese and dressing. Last time I ordered a Cobb salad it has tomatoes, eggs, cheese, and a few other thing. We did order the flautas and empanadas as an appetizers.  The flautas were probably the best out of all of our dishes. The empanadas were ok but they had so much sauce in the serving bowl that they were soggy on the bottom. The stuffed chicken was oddly flavored with half the dish being very sweet and have more savory. Very odd. Lastly the staff was not very friendly at all.
