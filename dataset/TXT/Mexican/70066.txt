bUEc1ZDgfZPymHyUXEiiNg I suppose if I looked up other locations you'd see I have given them good reviews too. I love this chain of semi independent authentic restaurants.

Family owned and operated yet part of a larger chain. Each location has its own vibe and decor, some better than others but the food is always hardy, filling and of great quality.

I ordered two burritos, Not that I could have eating two because they are huge. I saved the second one for breakfast as I knew I was not going to have a lot of time the next morning. 

One was steak and the other was Machaca which is egg, shredded beef, and typical Mexican marinated option and peppers. 

Most of the people coming in were the kind of mix that give it more character. A black family with three cute little kids, two guys in dress clothes and ties, a Hispanic family who seemed to be regulars, a couple of scary looking gangbangers who were actually polite and friendly, an older Spanish woman who seemed to not speak any english, and the Mexican staff working the counters and in back. I'm guessing mostly family and owners.

They were friendly and polite too. 

Its not fancy, or chic, its not trendy, dressed up or touristy, its just great food with a hardy authentic feel.
