bMSiHjs2fbKbBNPyuTwhHA Beautiful atmosphere absolutely terrible food and inexperienced service.  No tap beer, no blended drinks for a decent margaritas and out of steak for tacos.  We had a party of 8 and they forgot to call us to our table to start with.  We ordered taco, tamales, chips and salsa and two burgers.  The waitress was sweet but very shy and inexperienced.  The food order came out all wrong. They let us keep the wrong food but it took a long time to get the correct food delivered,  The tacos are ridiculously small and the chips and salsa are a joke!   We all felt they should be ashamed to call themselves Mexican food!   They would greatly benefit from a trip to Southern California to learn a little something about good Mexican food, the kind that keeps people coming back for more.  Sadly, I don't see this place lasting past the warm 
months.
