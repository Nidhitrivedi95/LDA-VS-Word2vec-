Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ If I could give this place zero stars, I would, out of spite. Was here on a recent Friday night, sat at the bar, had the Javier's marg & the guacamole. Both are average for good Mexican, no complaints. The margs are $18 and I think the guac is $10. The place has a reputation for being pricey. In any case, the reason for the poor rating is the service. Possibly the worst bartenders I have ever interacted with in any bar on the planet. It sounds like hyperbole, but it's just this yelper's honest opinion. Couldn't get a drink order in; couldn't get my bill. Credit card handed back with slime on it. 

If you read up on the story of the joint -- they're a chain from Orange Co., Calif. that caters to well-heeled diners -- you can see where the attitude comes from. It even extends to the weirdo bathroom attendant who talks your ear off. If you're trapped in the Aria and need a margarita, go to the casino bar off the gaming floor. They make a passable one with significantly less BS added in.
