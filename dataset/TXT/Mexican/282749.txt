XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg I went to the place a few weeks after its grand opening at Caesar's back in early 2005.  I naively just walked up to the hostess and asked if I could have some dinner (it was 5pm... the beginning of dinner service).  She said they were booked for the next six weeks but I could eat at the bar.  So I did.  Well I still remember the meal pretty well, and usually only that happens if it's significantly awesome.  And it was.  I had their signature blue corn-crusted snapper with the pepper and creme fraiche and for dessert I had the bread pudding.  I had a really good meal and I was really glad I went.
