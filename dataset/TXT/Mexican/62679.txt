I was a a last minute plus one for their first tasting dinner & beer pairing. So the stars aligned to my benefit. The dinner was Private and held on a Monday night, when they are usually closed.
The Eight Course Menu for the evening was not only local, but foraged and indigenous. 
Chef Stanger NAILED IT
My Top Three were Pemmican, Fried Purple Asperagus & I'iotois, and the Wolfberry Galette (If I had to pick three, but I'm not)
