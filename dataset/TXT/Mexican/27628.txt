3IwCop28R1_L5jMv6AkL8Q We used to love this place but the last few times it was not as great as it used to be. Today was one of the worst. My husbands taco shells were dripping with grease and my fish tacos had one piece of fish in each that was overcook. There were only 3 tables of couples at the time so not busy at all. The worst thing was our service. She brought our food and never came back to check on us or fill our empty glasses. I kept looking at her and she was at the counter the entire time chatting with the staff.  It wasn't just our table, she didn't check on any of the other tables either. We waited over 30 minutes after our food was served and I finally had to stop her to hand her the credit card.  
This will probably be our last time in there for awhile since it literally left a bad taste.
