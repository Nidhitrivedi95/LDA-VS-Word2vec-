From our appetizer, the elote fries to our main entrees! I had the tortas maya, a spicy chicken sandwich with bacon and avocado. The rest of the table loved their food as well, we had tacos burritos and enchiladas a little of everything. Can't say enough good things, it was an experience from beginning to end.
