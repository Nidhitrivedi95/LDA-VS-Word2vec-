VFcx35QDd_kZgLT4UDV8xg This restaurant reminds me of a Los Angeles taco stand.  I walked here from The Hard Rock which only took a few minutes.  I ordered a potato burrito and it came out perfectly; just like grandma used to make.  It has just enough firm fried potatoes and eggs to make my mouth happy.  

The fresh red picante sauce is spicy!  Yum.  Love the marinated jalapeños and carrots, which all taco stands should carry.  Radishes and cucumbers help cut the heat.  They even have the traditional plastic bags for the veggies like in LA.

It's very clean and service was swift.  The menu looks huge and includes menudo on the weekends, a great hangover cure.  I'll try the chills relleno next time.  

No coffee but go next door to Dunkin' Donuts for that.
