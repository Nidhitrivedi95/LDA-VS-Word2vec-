-e_UQJVTzIPweX4TcPUYVw Fantastic lunch with my teenage daughter today..  She had two tacos (carne asada and mahi-mahi), she said the pico de gallo was very good as well as the sauce on the mahi-mahi. She also remembers Revo burrito's creamy white rice, so was very excited to order a bowl of that. The black beans were also good, but I miss the little bit of lime everybody used to put in them.  She also had a glass of the peach lemonade and said it was wonderful, sweet and tangy.  

I ordered the mahi mahi rice bowl and it was absolutely fantastic and I had the creamy base as well, absolutely recommend. I also had a glass of Pinot Grigio. 

Very nice ambiance, great service from Kathy.  Total bill $42 before tip
