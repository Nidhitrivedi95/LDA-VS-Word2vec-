HyW8DBMowtmI6ZK4cr2ICA I'm surprised to see so many disappointed reviews! Yes, the price point is too high, but I've come to expect that when dining in Davidson. Mestizo is a very cute little restaurant with a great staff. The margaritas are excellent and they always offer great recommendations. I've had the fajitas many times. I've also ordered a Halibut special they had once and it was incredible. Great cut of fish and cooked perfectly. If you're entertaining out of town guests who say, "how about Mexican?" and you're looking for an nice atmosphere, don't count Mestizo out!
