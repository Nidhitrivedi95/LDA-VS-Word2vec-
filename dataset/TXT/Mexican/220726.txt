Started with the chips and salsa (comes with 3 different salsa and all of them had a really good flavor and spice). Had the prickly pear Margarita which was perhaps a bit too sweet for my liking but otherwise good flavor. The Carne Asada tacos were great! - steak was cooked to order and tender. Good service on a quiet Tuesday afternoon. Would make the trek back down the strip for this on my next visit.
