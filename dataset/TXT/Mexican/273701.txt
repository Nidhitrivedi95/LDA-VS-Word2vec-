x0BGoNkWuJeyvDQQL8Fk6g Tiny Mexican hole in the wall I found while looking for a different restaurant. The menu is brief - ten items.  When I was there, it was one bearded not very Mexican guy taking the orders and making the food. Every table has its own selection of hot sauces and little pots of seasonings.  I'm incredibly curious about this little restaurant. The decor is a mix of tiki hut, Mexican flags, Frida Kahlo art, paper lanterns, random movie posters and laminated pictures from the menu. They also have a selection of Mexican candies and beverages.

I had the enchiladas with mole sauce and they were good - I'm no mole expert but in my limited experience I felt that the sauce was a good example of Mole.  The kitchen is very tiny and I'm thinking that most everything they serve is reheated in a microwave but I also realize that this is probably the case in many situations where the kitchen is not visible.  

All in all a neat little experience and I would go again.
