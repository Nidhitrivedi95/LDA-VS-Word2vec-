C2BR0TjNacoNzItPLUHTAA Took the wife here for lunch and it was amazing.  It was very busy when we went but the food came out fast.  The fish burger (Mahi mahi) was amazing!  The wife ordered the calamari and chips which was still good but she regretted not ordering what I had.  We will definitely be back!
