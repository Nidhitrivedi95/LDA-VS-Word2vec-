_FXa_6j-6UDsxWo-KX7WvQ Some of the food is really good! The chicken enchiladas has some weird stuff added and those weren't great. Tacos are really good and the other enchiladas are good. The red and green chili sauce is very good. I would have given them 4 stars but the lack of some basics in New Mexico food meant I couldn't bring myself to do it. Huevos Ranchos should always be served with beans and hash browns of some sort, and they didn't have Sopapillas. But I'll go back and eat there again for sure. 

I'm excited to try their breakfast burritos.
