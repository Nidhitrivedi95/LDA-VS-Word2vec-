M8S7poDhCIzqQx1--GB-ww Came here with my friend last week to this quick diner style joint. When we came in, we were seated immediately. Since it was our first time, the 
waitress is very kind and explained the menu thoroughly. 

Cuban food is kinda spicy haha. We decided to share 2 items as recommended by the waitress. We ordered the guava bbq beef short ribs. It came with slaw, rice, beans, and tostones for $15 and we also had the black bean soup ($6). We couldn't really taste the guava flavour but the shortribs were very tender. If you can't handle spice, be careful as there are peppers hiding in the slaw. Soup is not bad either; the white sauce in soup is a little spicy. 

Dinner is ok... Heard this place is better for breakfast so maybe I'll come back then!
