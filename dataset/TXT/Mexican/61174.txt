as_fyujgsdwtV56n31z-Sw The tacos were flame warmed flour tortillas. Best thing ever. Thank you.

The tacos as a whole were not very good. The mix of flavors was odd and the aioli tasted like straight mayo on a pork taco. Not my thing.

The atmosphere and set up of Bomba was my style. Low lights, an open bar. Yes please.

Service from Sabina the bartender was perfect. She knew about the rum, recommended items from the menu in detail. 

I will come back for the service, drinks, atmosphere, and possibly a second chance on the tacos.
