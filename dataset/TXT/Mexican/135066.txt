IMb5BpDLlSbr7yn19HhltA The MAIN REASON I'm doing this review is to recognize a WONDERFUL WAITRESS named LETTY! She is ALWAYS on her A game! She is super efficient, very organized and comes at just the right times. She remembers us and knows what we get. She is very friendly and even when this place is busy, she never forgets to please every table she is serving. We never leave here disappointed when she serves us. I can't say that for the other servers! I had a girl named Maritza or Marcela I think and she left us dry while flirting with a table of guys 2 tables away! Very disappointing and it wasn't the first time she's helped us.  And for Lara, we've had her several times. Today was the worst, hence this review and why it's necessary! She forgot to place my order so my family got their orders except for me, on time anyway. She was helping a table of 8 and it's not even busy in here! The manager is friendly and every time she sees us she comes over to say hi. 
Other than these two who have ruined our experiences here, the food is still good. The price is right. And if your lucky to get LETTY then you have a great experience here.
