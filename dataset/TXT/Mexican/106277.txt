Fkj8vJocYilePMZv2y54WA I really wanted to be able to give this place a better review but I just can't.  I gave it multiple visits.  I tried - I really did.  But, in the end there're two reasons for where I eventually came out on this, those being the food and the nickle and dime attitude.  First, regarding the food, there are some things that this place does well.  For example, the carne asada is generally prepped well so that you don't get a lot of gristle and "carne de miscellaneous" in it.  That's a good thing.  Also, their regular quesadilla is very tasty and is reasonably priced for what you get.  Finally, I like their hot sauce (salsa roja).  On the other hand, their beans are a flavorless failure.  Their carnitas ooze enough grease to make the Exxon Valdez look like a Sierra Club member's kayak.  And, they fry off their tacos in oil at the wrong temperature so that the tacos emerge having sucked up so much oil that they're reminiscent of something that's been fracked out of the Bakken Shale.  Worse, to me though, is the nickel and dime approach which is just insulting in a town like Las Vegas.  For example, you only get one refill of your soda, which soda is priced about 50% above other similar places.  For further refills, you apparently have to buy a whole new soda.  Also, if you want to make any modifications to your order, be prepared to bleed for them.  For example, the upcharge for onions (onions!) on an item is 60 cents.  Thus, while the base price of a particular item might be fine, if you want to change anything, the add-ons and upcharges bear zero resemblance to the actual cost of the addition or modification.  In the end, between the hit-or-miss inconsistency of the food and the tacky, "bang-the-customer" attitude, I'm sorry, but two stars is the very best that I can do.
