X6YpIqhaP_qoSZJRBcivGw What once was the best Mexican food in Phoenix, has now dropped to a level of a chain of fast food. I come here monthly on business and have tried to bring my customers and co workers here as often as possible. It truly was good authentic food that had the freshness and flavor that made it a great experience. 
I came here on Monday with 3 others and left with a huge void. I deserved it though as the quality here has steadily declined over the past year so I deserved what I got. 

The reception was horrible even though we were one of only three people in the lobby.  The hostess had wandered off right when we walked in and had to wait for 5 minutes before we saw anybody. 

The Mexican pizza we ordered came out not even close to being hot and lacked any flavor. It was so bad we had them throw the rest away. 

When the main courses came out, even though I had brought it to their attention, the food was so cold we couldn't eat it. Not real happy to send food back after one complaint, we had them wrap up the rest and took it home to the good old microwave. 

Besides the temperature, the quality was just not there, even the salsa lacked any punch even after i asked for the hotter version.  

Too many places to spend my hard earned money to pay that much for the experience we had on Monday.
