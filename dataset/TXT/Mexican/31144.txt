4gO38_nlrPCHqEcs_6-AAg Great salsa selection and  the three I tried were great. The margaritas were just okay. Same with the tacos .I ordered the spicy chicken taco (which wasn't spicy) and the roasted pork and potato (but there was no potato on the taco). I would recommend just going for drinks and chips and salsa, not dinner. The tacos are just too pricey for nothing special.
