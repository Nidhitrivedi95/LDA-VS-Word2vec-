Sv1XtPN-utoenqdIn9ZMyQ This is my first time visiting, and I've been converted to a lifelong patron. My overall experience has been wonderful. The server was super kind and accommodated my vegetarian request. The kitchen made me two incredible veggie tacos complete with a side of rice. The salsas are wonderfully flavorful and spicy. This is the best of everything: local, great taste and great service. So happy that I popped in today!
