Nine times out of ten I order the carne asada burrito with RED CHILE. Unfortunately I only get that red chile about half the time I order it. Most of my orders are to go and when on the run, I don't really have much time to stop and unroll the burrito to check for that red chile but believe me, that red chile is so damn good. Not sure if the red chile button is broken but I make a point when ordering to say "RED CHILE". After my order is complete I even ask about the red chile to confirm and they assure me there's red chile. Before I leave I ask if the red chile is in there and they say, yes the red chile is in the burrito. Maybe red chile should just be offered on the side so we can put in the red chile ourselves. I don't know but something has to be done about the red chile.
