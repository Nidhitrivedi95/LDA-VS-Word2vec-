_rXRnGcU3RFtsehmdL0ucw Suggested by someone we met and did not live up to the hype. We orders mini chimi appetizer, enchiladas (chicken beef pork and cheese), chicken burro, and a beef soft taco. Chicken was DRY DRY DRY. ALL the enchiladas were undercooked. The corn tortillas were sooo dry and chewy. Beef was flavorless like it wasn't seasoned. Such a disappointment.
