pDewiJY6KCcZgLxxgxg13Q This is my second time here and their food is delicious. The first time I had their shrimp tacos and tasted my friends shrimp enchiladas. I had forgotten how tasty their hot sauce is... and how it makes your mouth burn and nose run and face sweat. Yes, it is hot, but worth the burn as the flavors make you forget how hot it really is. I tried their lunch special with a taco and bean tostada and it was amazing! I also split the shrimp enchiladas and practically had to be rolled out of the place. Worth every bite! Their food is incredibly good and you can tell by the long wait times to get into this location. The service is fast efficient and friendly.

If you are really hungry, call and order takeout. The wait can be an hour long for the dining room.
