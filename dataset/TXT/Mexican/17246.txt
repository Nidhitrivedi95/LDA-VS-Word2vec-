1JDRyjdfkE_iSwUGs_ZX1w Wowza. This must be the best burrito I have tried in a long, long time. 
I had the juicy and delicious chipotle chicken burrito, and lemme tell ya - it was worth every single cent. Sure, their prices may be a bit higher than the competition, but boy is it worth it.

The interior is rather charming, I thought. Feels like an authentic place, rather than a poshed up chain like Chipotle (not that I mind Chipotle, but the interior difference is quite striking). The service was very friendly when I was there and she took her time to explain things and answer questions. It was not the cleanest of spaces, but honestly, just the cool vibe and the ridiculously delicious burrito made a whole world of difference. 

Cannot wait to go back there again! YUM!
