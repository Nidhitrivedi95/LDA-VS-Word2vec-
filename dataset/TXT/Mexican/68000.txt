BHMY0sZXJ-6bjTT0V1ubEw I usually get double steak and guac on my burrito, so it ends up being pretty pricey.  It's still worth it so I decided to treat myself today.  

I've never been to this one before, all the employees are really nice and helpful.  I got my usual and waited to be rung up so I could delve into this beautiful monster of a burrito, and as the (I'm assuming manager) comes over she just gives me my burrito and says it's on them today. 

Free burrito!  I can't express how delicious it made this whole experience.  I have no idea why, but I'm not gonna question it, I'll definitely be back and give them a nice tip next time too.

This has only happened to me once before; I had asked for guac on my burrito, but they were out and I had to wait for them to make more.  I got my burrito for free and only had to wait between 5 and 10 minutes, so worth it.
