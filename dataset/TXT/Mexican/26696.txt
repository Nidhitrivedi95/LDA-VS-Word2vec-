3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ Happy hour lasts until 7 and is great for drinks but only food item on the menu is the taco of the day. 

Have to get taco if you come (duh). All were solid but in ordering chicken, pork and beef thought the beef was the best. 

Is a really cool building which I am sure would make for a great location to take an out of towner.
