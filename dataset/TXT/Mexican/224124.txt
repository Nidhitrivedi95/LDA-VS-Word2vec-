RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg An amazing lunch.  Out for a stroll and looking for lunch when I find this place.  I had no idea what I was in for - amazing street tacos.  I had a steak and a spicy pork, ate those and then ordered two more of the pork.  While not a cheap street taco, with horchata I spent $10 for lunch, which is not bad for Vegas.  Even better that it was for fabulous tacos.  Love the flavors!  I need to go back and try the tongue...
