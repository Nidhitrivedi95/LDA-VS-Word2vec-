I don't find it to be too terribly authentic when compared to other Mexican restaurants in the area - Don Patron in Hudson is 5-stars every time and service is consistently better. Service here is hit or miss depending on who is working, how busy they are, and well, mood of the staff that particular day. The owner has been here on the couple of times I've been in, but she has not interacted with me or my table. The food has been as hit or miss as service with the one time being pretty good to the other times being so-so at best. I've given it a few tries hoping for a different result, but at this point probably won't be back for a while.  On a positive note, the margaritas have been good each time. So maybe it's just good for a margarita and chips and salsa.
