G6BwYw_0_atLPTzI1uokIA Its our first time here. 
We really enjoyed it! 
Based on the reviews, we tried the filet nachos and the spicy shrimp nachos. Both were good but  spicy!
My teen got 3 small corn beef tacos and she said, "These are amazing!"
We even bought a t-shirt!
But even though the price tag says $15, the server tried to charge me $20 for a shirt.
When I disputed it she said it rings up at $20. She was not willing to adjust, no matter what - even when the hostess agreed with me.
She eventually got the check adjusted but it took forever to get our check,  and then again forever to get my change.  
I was at the hostess waiting. Crazy!
10% tip that time.  Usually I pay 25% but I don't reward attitude.
We will be back, though.  Free margarita when you check in with an entree order. Nice!
The guacamole app. Was a good size and really delicious. 
I bet if you came here,  you'd enjoy it.
