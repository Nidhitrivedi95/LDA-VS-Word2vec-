gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw Made My Vegas Vacation Thank You Chef Lorena Garcia!

On my recent vacation to Vegas we went to various restaurants.  Chica over delivered.  From the knowledgeable and courteous wait staff to the most amazing Latin food I have eaten.  This restaurant is clearly a fusion of many Latin and Caribbean cultures. I have had the opportunity to have many different types of Latin foods in my life due to places I have lived and Chica was able to bring the best of all the cultures together.
I went for brunch and had the Latin Breakfast. Two eggs scrambled, with the house made chorizo sausage, with assorted arepas.  My mother had the chicken sausage and both were amazing.  It had been so long since I had arepas and it brought me back home. When I tell you the eggs were season to perfection and something as simple as the coffee was the best cup of coffee I have ever had.  I could have drunk it black with no sugar.  The waitress was so knowledgeable about the menu and where the food is sourced. She also got the kitchen to prepare us a small sample plate of two of the lemon doughnuts.  We really wanted to try them but were full after our meal.  I understand now why the lemon doughnuts are award winning.  Chef Lorena Garcia is clearly doing what she was created on this earth to do because eating at her restaurant is a gift.  
I recommend you place Chica Restaurant on your must eat list when you visit Vegas!
