iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg Stopped by for a small meal after going to Rasta Pasta. This place was packed! There's no AC in the shop either, so it gets pretty hot with all the people packed in. Only one 6-person table, the rest is a counter for standing.

++ Gobernador ($5)- smoked marlin, shrimp, and cheese taco. Large taco, smoked marlin was a little drying, but the salsa helps. Really flavorful though.
+ Poke and chips ($10)- salmon poke, chips, and guac. Poke was good, but the chips were sprinkled with sugar. Not really a fan of that.
++ Aqua fresca ($2)- flavor of the day was watermelon mint. Super refreshing in the heat!

Only cash and debit accepted.
