MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA I love grand electric. I hate their lines and waiting. But i love them so much that i would wait in those lines (and have waited) for hours and hours. 

The convenient thign is that theyre so close to bars... if your patient (and good things come to those who wait) you can grab a drink somewhere then get the text that your table is ready and have some of the most amazing food in this city.

Im biased. I LOVE the spicy squid. I could eat that every week (if i could only get to parkdale every week). Its hot and spicy and delicious and crunchy and the toppings are amazing. they also have a variation of it with octopus which i love as well.

my favorite tacos are the Baja Fish and the Scrapple. But everythign is genuinly veyr tasty. I just always go back to ordering more and more of those.

I also thank this restaurant for introducing me and my husband to Bourbon. Hes become quite the little bourbon connosoiur and i love headign here to tyr new ones on their list. 

Price wise - its cheap and cheerful and OH if you have space...their lemon merengue pie was also a perfect way to end off a meal here. :) Will continue to come back over and over again.
