TZl7YBuzo5awZP8QJDLg_w We decided to try out a new local sonaran style mexican restaurant and passing by Jordan's on several occasions I was curious to see what this was all about. I recommend calling in to make a reservation just in case they happen to be busy on a weekend. This place reminds me of being at a traditional mexican home feel. We are first served with fresh chips and homemade salsa! The homemade margaritas were made by the server himself, and he made a mean margarita! The dishes were fairly priced and I had the ground beef burro with a side of fresh guacamole and rise. OH lastly there tea is freshly brewed(I love me some tea)!
