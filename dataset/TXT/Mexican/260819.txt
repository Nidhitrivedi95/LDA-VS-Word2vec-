VRwT0pscR5vESCrAnUpNwQ At first I wasn't impressed by the ordering structure, but it turned out to be easy enough in the end. The food was pretty good and prices were fair. Pretty cool atmosphere. If I could sum up what I thought of this place it would be, very King West. Not what you would expect from a proper Mexican place but a Mexican place with a "Canadianized" menu and more of a King West vibe. All in all, it was good based on expectations.
