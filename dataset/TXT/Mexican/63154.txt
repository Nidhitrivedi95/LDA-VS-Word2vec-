ayaDm0WPZB0g0PYbGFkrzA Came here to try since it's located on the growing 7th St. 

All I gotta say is... meh. 

Heard servers complaining about girls not giving good tables? Big Turn off and tip reducer. The food was decent but the drinks were amazing. The music was super loud and nobody seemed to care. 

I feel like everyone including the management needs to grow up and be trained again. Customers hear how everyone talks to each other. 

I may come again for a drink. Maybe.
