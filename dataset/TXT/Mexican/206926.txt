Q4AWWdBWe_ojYX1a4ffXFQ This is probably the worst taco restaurant I have ever been to the employees can barley speak English and the meat is bland and the over charge for tacos they are only $2.00 but $1.00 for cheese on each taco and $1.00 for sour cream so for two tacos it came out to $7.58 I would not reccomend eating here!!! Now if the food was good and they had better customer service it is a prime spot
