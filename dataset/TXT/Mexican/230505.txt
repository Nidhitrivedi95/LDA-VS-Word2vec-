Smaller, quieter space with white linen tablecloths and better silverwear.  In an old historic building with lots of charm this place is TINY.  When I say tiny, I mean there are probably only five tables for maybe 20 diners at the most.  You'd better make a reservation if you plan on eating here.  Lots of local art both inside and outside to look at.  So that is the ambiance.

The food is excellent as what you would expect from this celebrated chef.  Smaller menu than the original Barrio and includes a 6 course tasting menu.  Some of her best dishes are on the regular menu including the Chilies en Nogada and Pork Pibil.  Prices are slightly higher than the main Barrio and i'm guessing that is to make up for the smaller number of guests she can serve.  Drink prices are noticeably higher especially.  Philip was our server and he was charming and made us tableside guacamole (not sure this is the way he was supposed to make it but the guac wasn't chopped up like usual....just the sliced avocados with all of the other ingredients mixed in).  It was still delicious but made it harder to use a dip for the chips.  

We loved everything we had and the chocolate dessert with Quaxacan chocolate and fresh berries and cream was heaven.  It was my birthday dinner so Philip bought us a Flan and it was way better than most Flan I have had....not a gellatanous glob, but a rich, textured Flan drizzled with just the right amount of sauce and topped with nuts.  

My one complaint would be the air conditioning....it was extremely warm the entire time we were there, otherwise it was top notch and I will definitely return!
