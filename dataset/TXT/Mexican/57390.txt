a8pmtlVKf7NiSLI-4KejIw Finally got to try this place.Stopped in here with a friend for lunch today. We did the lunch special - one salad and two tacos for $15. I had the El Catrin salad which was flavorful and also a decent sized portion. I tried the Baja and Gorbernator tacos. Neither was mind blowing, but they were still enjoyable. I thought there was too much batter on the cod in the Baja and it overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients. The shrimp in the Gorbernator were not up to much, but I liked the sauce on that taco. I also enjoyed the three salsas they provided. I tried the Michelada it was the hugest drink ever. I wasn't in love with it, so I left some behind which is saying something for this girl. The best thing about this experience other than hanging out with my chica, was the ambiance. I really liked their patio and I was down with the tunes they had going. I have a feeling I will be back here soon to explore other items on the menu.
