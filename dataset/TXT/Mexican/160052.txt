KxGVWLAhwWjEOWfx2R2T8Q I ordered catering for my daughter's baby shower.  The guy who took the order on the phone told me that he would send an email confirmation.  He said that we "would stay close" until the event to make sure that I was completely satisfied with the catering.  I never heard back.  I called them again a few days later and he was not available.  I got another person on the phone who sent the email with the order info.  It only had listed the food.  No date or time on the order.  They have a very poor system of ordering for catering.  We had multiple email exchanges so I thought they had my order.  

On the day of my event, I did not have food for my guests at the scheduled time.  It took me almost half an hour to get resolution.  They were more concerned with placing blame and making excuses.  I got my food 1 HOUR LATE.  We had to be out of our party room at a designated time so I had to rush my guests.  In addition, I missed a significant amount of time with my guests trying to resolve.  My once in a lifetime event was stressful and embarassing to me as the hostess.  

I schedule catering for lunches a couple times a month for my job.  With so many excellent catering options in the Valley, I would avoid using them at all.
