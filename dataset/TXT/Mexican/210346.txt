qME1CvFxSrhqE6-YGcp3Rw I've been here twice and will return! The rooftop patio on this place is amazing! It's cozy and full of life! The drinks and food are great as well. There's a variety of seating available including outdoor and at the bar. This place can get pretty packed on the weekends so plan accordingly. I fully recommend the tacos made your way!
