FoKx_RP4kUM-aiGo3wlUUw I've driven by here many times and never noticed this place, but then I had two different people in the same week recommend it!

Got a day off, so we stopped in for a late lunch. It looks smaller from the outside than it is inside. It's clean and the decor is inviting with a Mexican theme of course.

We were welcomed and seated right away. Our server was prompt to bring chips and salsa and to take our drink order. The menu has a good selection. We decided on the Shrimp Salad appetizer for me and the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp for my friend. 

The food came out fairly quick and looked great! The Shrimp Salad appetizer looked and tasted delicious! It had cucumbers, tomatoes, red onion, avocado, cilantro and shrimp tossed in lemon juice!  I renamed it Cerviche Salad because it has almost all the same ingredients and had the same flavor! The bacon wrapped shrimp was cooked just right. It came with rice and beans and sauteed veggies.

We also ordered a couple $1 margaritas. They were perfect for lunch and very flavorful!

This place rates excellent for service, prices, atmosphere and food!
