fd0xELX7-1qth_yFl7Q9UQ I just moved back to Toronto after living in Mexico CIty for 5 years, and this is the most authentic Mexican place I've found in the city so far. The tortillas are just as good as in Mexico, the totopos (chips), tostadas, and fresh salsas are also on par with what I would get down there. 

For true taco connaisseurs, these are "tacos de guisado" which means they put rice, beans, and a "guisado" or "main dish" in each taco. They have chicken tinga, chicken mole, potato with chorizo, chile relleno (stuffed pepper), and a couple vegetarian options which I can't remember. My only complaint about the food is that I wish the chile relleno were filled with cheese rather than potato but it's good nonetheless. 

The service is a bit slow as there is often only one person working but it gives me time to look at the small selection of Mexican products they sell and pick up some stuff to bring home. The price is reasonable but still makes me long for the prices I used to pay in Mexico. I have been there several times, and I will definitely go back.
