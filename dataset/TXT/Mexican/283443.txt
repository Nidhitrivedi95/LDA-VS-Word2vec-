XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg I highly recommend Mesa Grill. We're staying at Caesars Palace and were looking for a good place for a late breakfast.  This property is pretty much a ghost town for breakfast foods so we waited for Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill to open. 

We've eaten here before for lunch and dinner but the appetizer menu is so perfect for brunch. The Mushroom quesadilla with a soft fried egg on top is to die for and the duck tacos are phenomenal!  Next time we will order the duck with less sauce but that's our taste, perhaps not yours. 

We will do this again for sure and when we need a bite to eat on the gambling floor Mesa may be our #1 choice for to go orders
