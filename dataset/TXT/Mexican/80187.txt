cWtUKKsnEYy1WeR1aEdyMA Omgggggggg!!! Amazing Mexican food!
So I am Mexican, I am also vegetarian my hubby is Mexican and a carnivore so we have different perspectives regarding food, we both agree that the food here is amazing.
The tlacoyos, quecas and Guac were amazing (and vegetarian) the tacos al pastor "felt like mexico" (he said) so it was a win -win. The service and the dessert were also great. The chef (who is from Mexico) came to greet us and ask how was everything, that was a nice touch. 
We are for sure coming back and I highly recommend Fonda Lola to anyone who is a Mexican food lover 

Get the churros con cajeta for dessert
