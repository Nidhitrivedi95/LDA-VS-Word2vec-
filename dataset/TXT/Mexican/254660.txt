V9KtZRYkprtkTPMDK31HMA Visiting my family that lives in Chandler and bought a Groupon for this hot spot. Fun decor on the inside with tons of flat screen t.v.'s and a good amount of space to accommodate groups. Servers were very friendly and the food was pretty good and tasty. The basil garlic fries were yummy and burgers and sandwiches were to everyone's liking. Happy hour is pretty awesome 11am-7pm, and they have a great drink selection including wine on tap!
Next visit, I'm definitely coming back! Oh, this is a kid friendly establishment before 7pm...don't let the outside fool you!
