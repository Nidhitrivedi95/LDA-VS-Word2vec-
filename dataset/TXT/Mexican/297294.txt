zdE82PiD6wquvjYLyhOJNA Great food and service! A small, simple place in an unassuming spot. Which is great for keeping prices low, but not for people driving across town and hoping to dine in. But, the food is so good, I'll eat it in my truck if I have to. Good size portions yet inexpensive enough were you can try multiple menu items in one visit. Definitely recommend.
