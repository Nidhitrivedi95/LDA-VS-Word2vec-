DO5mQxiBOgHEznosjxvJXw Just finished my Birthday lunch here .. we stumbled upon this while shopping at boulevard and I saw decent reviews so since we were Downey Sunrise I decided why not try this out for lunch ..

Let me just say I'm shocked how good it actually is from the moment we were seated it was on point ..

Initially we were helped by Oz who recommended a Avocado Margarita to me and was super friendly with a smile ..

After which Rudy greeted us and brought our drinks and kept out tables filled with drinks and chips and a friendly smile ..

Our server ended up being Rolando and he was attentive and helpful and very friendly..

Now when it comes to the food we got 

Table Guac which was really good for the $7 cost 

For our entrees we got one Torta Blvd with sweet potato fries and omg it was delicious

I opted for six oysters be a ensalasa de casa which was delicious

The Avocado Margarita was decent but the cucumber Margarita was so freaking delicious definitely recommend it

It seems like happy hour is best time to come and they are doing a valentines special too so definitely check this place out !!
