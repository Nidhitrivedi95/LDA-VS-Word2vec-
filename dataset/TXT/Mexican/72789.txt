Cd2ERofxOeCbCi-0yDs0aw I almost didn't go here because I couldn't find a menu online, but the reviews were so good that I took a chance. I'm so glad I did. This place was amazing and my new favorite Mexican restaurant! It hits the trifecta: great food, great service and ridiculously cheap prices. I got the frybread taco and my husband got the savory sopapilla. We got it with green chili that was amazing. I could have just eaten the green chili by itself. The meal also came with housemade tortilla chips and three kinds of salsa. The tortilla chips are addicting and the salsas are spicy and flavorful. The guys working there were really nice and helpful. I was kind of expecting a bare-bones operation, but they brought the food to us, checked occasionally to make sure we had everything, chatted with us about which menu items to order, etc. The decor is charmingly hole-in-the-wall, which I liked. We will definitely be coming here on a regular basis!
