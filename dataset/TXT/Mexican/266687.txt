WGkqfp1-3130v8xhCb3APg Two of us went in on a Tuesday for lunch. The atmosphere was very nice. Our waitress brought us waters right away. A couple disclaimers that are not reflected on the establishment. Chips and salsa are an add on and their food is larger than expected which they do tell you. We ordered a normal size chicken burrito with pineapple salsa and a double taco. 

The reason for four stars is because of the way they do business. Now I understand you have to keep up with the times and a lot of places are doing this but it is a huge pet peeve of mine. You do NOT serve online orders before seated guests. 

The online orders have already been received and they can wait when they come to pick it up. The people who are sitting there waiting are the ones that took the time, want to be there, and will give you a tip. They are first and foremost. 

Overall, the service was very good and the food was great! I will be back!
