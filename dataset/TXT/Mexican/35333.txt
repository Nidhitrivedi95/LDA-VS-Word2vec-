57aBx6Mo_VRk_kMA8J5Efg Certainly not a horrible restaurant but I'm not eager to return. Service was sub-par, with the hostess getting our drinks, and the waitress assuming we were ready to order after waiting on her for over 10 minutes. The food came quickly and portion size was plentiful, but I would rather visit other Mexican restaurants for more authentic food.
