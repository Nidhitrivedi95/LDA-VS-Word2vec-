mkZFZkuue9am7PRp9dt1jA I purchased several things from them earlier this week , I live 5 minutes away. My boyfriend and I order 2 corns and my son a single scoop of ice cream and we asked for a Duro loco to go. As soon as we got home and sat on the table to enjoy our duro loco , my boyfriend noticed something tasted weird so he said to take it back and asked for another one without the cabbage. So I took it right back , like I mentioned before I only live 5 minutes away. I walked in and this rude ass lady noticed I went back so I kindly asked her if she could give me a new one without cabbage because the cabbage tasted bad , she opened it and sarcastically said "omg you almost ate it all" so I looked at her like BITCH I just left and you made it for me TF! anyways she said "well what do you want" I clearly told her just to make a new one without the cabbage. She grabbed the one she made and took it to the kitchen and as she was walking to the kitchen she said "next time before you finish it all just bring it back right away" customer service first lady , you could've simply avoid an argument with the customer and made the new one without the sarcasm. And we did not eat half of it we had barely tasted. Obviously not going backto this location again I rather drive a little more down to charleston to get a better service and better quality (:
