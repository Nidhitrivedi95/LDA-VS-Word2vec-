zdE82PiD6wquvjYLyhOJNA I think J would be shocked that I wouldn't rate this higher.

KoMex was on our bookmarked list for a long time, so when we finally got around to it, I guess we just had higher expectations than what we were actually served.

Place was understaffed - just one lady helping out the entire store.  You take pity, but at the end of the day I can't say I'm not deducting a point for that inconvenience.

Parking was sparse, but manageable.  Service, though understaffed and overwhelmed, was polite.

Food took a while to cook, and was alright.  It felt rushed - not sure if D & I will try this place again.
