1pytOeO_PhT4EVpk2MXQBA I really enjoy this Taco Bell. I've come to this one frequently when I'm out late at night either at Spokes or Xtreme Bean. The staff has always been unbelievably kind and friendly to me, and have countlessly fixed mistakes either made by themselves or the consumer. I recommend this Taco Bell to anyone in the area or traveling thru.
