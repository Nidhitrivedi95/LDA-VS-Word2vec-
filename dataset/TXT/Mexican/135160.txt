IMb5BpDLlSbr7yn19HhltA First, let me clarify that what I am about to describe, is not representative of the typical experience I've enjoyed at any of the various Arriba's locations I have dined at previously.

Over the weekend, my girlfriend and I stopped in the Goodyear Arriba's for dinner. We weren't particularly hungry due to the heat. Unfortunately, the service we received in the bar practically made it a realistic possibility that we weren't going to eat.

We arrived at dinner time, around 6, and there was a small wait. There appeared to be a few parties ahead of us waiting outside. We bypassed that and headed to the bar. We got the last two bar stools, but it wasn't particularly busy in this part of the restaurant. I didn't get the name of the male bartender, and that's probably a good thing for him. All he did was get us chips and salsa and our beers. After that, he was A.W.O.L.

Thankfully, we enjoyed our cervezas (the house amber). And the Carne Asada Tacos we shared were good. But even the female bartender who got us menus and took our order was a little off. Eventually, she closed our check and we left with a little bit of a bad taste in our mouths.
