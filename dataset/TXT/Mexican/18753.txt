It's all pretty tasty but they definitely skimp on the cheese. I haven't been brave enough to try the spicy salsas and stick with the pico de gallo, you also have a choice of white or black beans with the burrito option. The meats could use more taste but all in all a pretty cool place and the staff is nice and efficient.
