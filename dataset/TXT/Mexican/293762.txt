yz66FIUPDKGhILDWzRLeKg It's hard for a restaurant to nail all the points but Slick's does. We came in with a party of 17 including 6 kids and couldn't have chosen a better place. The atmosphere was awesome. They had kids menus, coloring pages and hot wheels which kept the kiddos entertained and the parents happy. The service was incredible (Megan rocks!!!!). The drinks were delicious  (I had a jalepeno Marg, my husband had a huge cold IPA). The food was good. Between pur entire table we almost tried everything on the menu. They even had vegetarian dishes. No complaints. I wish we had a Slick's in the east valley!
