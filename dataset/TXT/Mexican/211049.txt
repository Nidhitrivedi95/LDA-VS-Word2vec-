The restaurant looks deceiving from the outside, but when you go inside, you receive a very authentic warm feel of an atmosphere like you are in Mexico. It was a pleasant evening so we opted to sit in the back patio that included a waterfall, exterior chimney, old Mayan masks hanging on the walls, and all of this covered with a umbrella shape tree which lights up after dawn.
 
Despite a rather long menu and numerous dinner specials, we ordered a reasonably priced and great dish called carne asada, which is is a combination dish of beef, with guacamole, quesadilla, enchilada, rice and beans on the side.
 
The wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable; they appeared to take pride in making sure we enjoyed ourselves. We also noticed that the owners were present and seemed to take pleasure in engaging with both their customers and  workers. 

All and all Dos Amigos is a great place to enjoy excellent real Mexican food (not tex-mex) accompanied by some Mexican beer or a refreshing margarita.
