mlc5N9qL6UYbtcwzVqgmzw Keep on going... to another place. We ate here a couple of months ago. This is all you need to know: VERY loud, obnoxious patrons (they seem to like it that way), low quality food, no service from bartenders (unless you are wearing a HD t-shirt).

Cave Creek needs a lot of things. Roadhouse is not one of them. It just reinforces the community as a destination for drunks.

I had a burger. It was over cooked. The fries it came with were just your every-day food service stuff out of a box. My beer was cold. My friend had the nachos, loaded. The chicken was very dry and the plastic-cheese became a solid mass quickly. I am willing to give them an honest try, but I was extremely disappointed.
