     Lady Marmalade is a great place for brunch if you don't mind the long lines. I've only been here twice but that's often enough to learn how quickly this place fills up. At 8:30am, half an hour after opening, this place is already almost completely packed. The menu is comprised of a nice mix of classic options with fun, creative, and modern twists that all sound really good! The prices are also pretty reasonable, as are the portions; nothing huge, but the dishes don't leave you hungry either. 
     As for the actual food, all I can say is that this place really needs to work on the quality control.The eggs Benedict with the pulled pork was delicious!! However, on my second visit, I ordered the eggs Benny with brie, avocado, and bacon - kind of a disappointment. The eggs were over poached, the potatoes were slightly underdone, and the side salad was dry. But this place made a such a great first impression on me, I'll definitely be going back to go back to try some of its other dishes. 

Also, for some reason, it seems that only one of the two washrooms has a door that can lock.
