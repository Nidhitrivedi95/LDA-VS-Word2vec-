Upon hearing that this joint was owned by the same people as Emiliano's, I had really high hopes. We went on a Thursday night and sat at the bar. Our server was not just inattentive, but borderline hostile.  I accidentally ordered my food too early because she mumbled when asking what drinks we wanted.  Instead of rolling with it and taking our food order, she just glared at me and asked about drinks again.  20 minutes later we got to order our food. It was good, but not extraordinary. 

The saving grace here is that this place is brand new, and that it's a really cute atmosphere, but neither of those things would make me choose this over Emiliano's or Bakersfield.
