We opted for Los Taquitos because it was close to where we were staying and we found information online that said Guy Fieri had visited one of their sister locations with good reviews. We browsed the menu online before placing our order in the store. The lady who took our order was amazing and soooo patient. This after my going through and taking the cilantro off and adding lettuce and cheese to three out of four of the menu items I ordered. Two of the people in our party ordered burritos (shrimp and green chile pork) and the other two ordered street tacos (carnitas and asada) and between us we tried the tostadas (carnitas and asada). The shrimp burrito was good with a little bit of spice (possibly in the wrap)?, my hubby enjoyed the green chile burrito but wished it had been a tad bit spicier. I had the carnita and asada street tacos which were delicious. The asada was so tender and so savoury, I am a big fan of the carnita but this time I completely favoured the asada. The tostadas were delicious - crisp shell, beans, meat, cheese and lettuce. My mum loved the refried beans, said they were the best she has ever had, the rice equally good. Our only complaint was that the guacamole was a bit bland but the rest of the food more than made up for that. We didn't eat in the restaurant but this place had a funky casual vibe so maybe that is something to try next time!
