yAXWKWRTs4wNy-zrJgoeXQ On a random Tuesday, I stopped by Tranquilo for a lunch with a coworker. They have a special for the month of February - $2 tacos all day! Score! I ordered three and my coworker got five (they are small tacos and he's a big dude haha). I had a shrimp taco, carne asada taco, and a pork taco. He ordered two carne asada tacos, a shrimp taco, fish taco and a veggie taco. I wish I had better things to say about Cafe Tranquilo... but the food was not impressive. The restaurant itself was cute but nothing spectacular, and overall not worth the visit.

Out of the 5 varieties of tacos we ordered, the only ones we actually liked were shrimp, fish and veggie. The carne asada tacos were bland and the pork taco was also lacking in flavor, and even worse, it was soggy! The shrimp and fish tacos were flavorful due to chipotle aioli and fancy crema, but without these sauces I don't think the tacos would be any good.

There are far too many great Mexican restaurants in Phoenix to eat mediocre tacos. I won't return.

+ avocado salsa very tasty
+ $2/taco all month long (Feb.2017)
+ shrimp and fish tacos were good
- chips and salsa are not complementary
- no spicy salsa or hot sauce available
- carne asada and pork tacos were meh
