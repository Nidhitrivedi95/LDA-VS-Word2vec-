rp1TgQObnIIRZw3fHWSwJA Terrible service tonight and it wasn't even busy. Waiter who was actually really nice took order then we didn't see her the rest of the night. Only 1/2 of our food order was delivered. Had to flag someone else down to get the rest. Nobody checked in on us. 3 employees including a manger spent the whole time cleaning the bar so they could leave for the night. Clearly ownership and management issues here.
