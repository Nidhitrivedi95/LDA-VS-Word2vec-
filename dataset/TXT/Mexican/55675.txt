A-ToCCe7d2lWM2uXGVMO7g We visited this place to take home dinner for a lazy night.

The burrito was good - my boyfriend and I both got the spicy pork and it had a good kick, which was awesome! 

The service was good, the gentleman behind the counter was really friendly and helpful, the only thing was he was there all by himself, so the process was a little slow because he had to help multiple people at once. It didn't bug us, we didn't have a schedule, but it might bug someone else.
