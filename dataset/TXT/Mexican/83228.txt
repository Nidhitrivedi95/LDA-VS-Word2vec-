D3MfMrIoNV4_aXPj0bi1BQ Lopez is your best bet for margaritas on the east side - hands down.  Reviews will accurately point out that they can be pricy, but happy hour can help a lot.  But even if you're paying full price, you're getting a great choice of flavors if that's your thing - mango, watermelon, blood orange, jalapeno....

Taco varieties are high end and really good.  The prices might seem high, buy the tacos are stuffed.  1 or 2 will do it. BMF burritos are BMFers and, in my opinion, worth the price.

Complimentary chips and salsa are good.  The guacamole is only ok.  You'd expect something kick ass here, but you won't get it.

Decor, vibe and service are great.  Awesome and picturesque patio for the nice weather is a big bonus.  Valet only parking, though is a bit of a drag.
