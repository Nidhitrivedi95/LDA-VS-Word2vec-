Cv6U-7HrrkKuh-_ec7EktQ Good fish tacos but they are very large in comparison to the other street tacos.  Not a big fan of the mango they put on the fish tacos but they tasted pretty good.  Fairly reasonable pricing, clean restaurant, staff seemed fairly friendly.  Would go back - but it's not at the top of my list for mexican.  Hope it stays though as it's nice to have in the area.
