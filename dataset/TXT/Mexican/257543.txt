ViJGzET7fBMShhIgKew2Bg I have been to this restaurant many times, so this review is based on overall experience.
I tend to get lengthy with my reviews.  I'll keep it blunt.

Nachos-  great.  Good size portion for an appetizer.  Meat is well seasoned.  Chips are freshly fried.  A little skimpy on the side condiments (pico de gallo and guac). 

Fish Tacos- Excellent.  Often times a matter of taste.  A lot of people prefer a meatier fish for their fish tacos.  I prefer a lighter, flakier fish with a milder "fishy" taste.  I'm not sure what fish they use, but I assume a basa or cod.  Good sized portion for the price.  Not overly greasy.  Had to ask for the lime for acidity.  Not sure if they forgot or if they normally do not serve it with lime.  Either way- tartness is a must for me with a fish taco. 

Chimichanga- Not their strongest dish, but satisfying.  Crispy, but greasy.  I have a huge appetite, but I could not finish this dish.  I read another review that said that the sauce they use in the ground beef chimi tastes like big mac sauce.  I'd have to say that's a spot on description.
This gets a mark between a "meh" and an "OMG".

All shortcomings in the meal are forgivable and this place should warrant closer to a 5 star rating, however it loses marks for the temperature.  It's very difficult to enjoy a meal to its max potential if you're not comfortable, and this place is hot! Loses a star for that.

I shall return again and again..
