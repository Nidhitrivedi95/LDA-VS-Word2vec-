The outside area is gorgeous and the menu is simple but has great options. Went here with another avid beer drinker on June 2nd with high expectations and left after a sampler flight. All of the beers for the most part are sour which some people like and I tend to as well. Got a beer that tasted like apple cider vinegar. My favorite beers are IPAs and honestly couldn't drink this sour beer. Will probably return in the future as I enjoy supporting local businesses and enjoy beer. Staff was great as well, friendly and quick.
