Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ I came here on St. Patrick's day and even though the strip was super busy we were sat on the patio immediately. The service was spectacular, our server was attentive and nice and our food came out in a timely fashion. I got the chicken tacos and they were AMAZING. Some of the best Mexican food I've had on the strip. Would definitely come here again next time I'm in the area.
