j7Rgozl24WrmDeqFCCKwQg Seen this place on uber eats and decided to give it a try. I ordered the regular bacon cheese burger and had the cheese fries with it. Because I tried it through uber it did take a little bit of time but when it did arrive it was still warm. The burger was really good and reminded me of a nice homemade burger which tasted really good. The fries were awesome! If you are ever in the area, give this place a try!
