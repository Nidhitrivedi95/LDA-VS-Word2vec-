wfnvI08SMHeIH6_lOeZ7xA Prepare yourself for excellent authentic Mexican food with delicious margaritas at a very affordable price.  We have gone to this cozy, family run restaurant countless times over the years.  It's a hidden gem in the Yonge and Eglinton area where places tend to come and go and prices are often high.  This spot has stayed the test of time with enormous value and excellent food.  You must have the margaritas- they are excellent.  For food, it's hard for me to choose as I love their entire menu but if you are looking for something unique to traditional Mexican food I would suggest that their mole chicken is excellent.  I love everything and you can't go wrong.  One reason why I LOVE them is because I don't eat cilantro and they don't give me any grief about it being essential to Mexican cuisine, they just omit it for me.  It's a small place so be prepared for some wait time while they prepare your delicious meal to order - have a margarita - enjoy!
