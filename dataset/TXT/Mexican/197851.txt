p-w6g8cuQq5PU_4U1XNCzQ Friendly staff, which is why I'd probably give it another try but the food didn't do much for me.  Salsa is just ok.... Could be the dish I ordered because I had a hard time finishing or eating it. Maybe it was too bland I don't know. But my husband cleaned his plate completely so either he was so hungry anything taste good or it's really that good. I will go back and try another dish and edit my review if my thoughts change.  It's worth a shot to try it out.
