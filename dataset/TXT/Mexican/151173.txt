Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ BOTTOM LINE:  there are so many great spots in LV, we probably won't be back.

Pros: The location is GREAT, vibe is so relaxed, hot waitresses, good music, optional outdoor seating.  The guests looked happy & the staff were busting their butts....(except the bartenders)

Cons:  we sat at th bar & got awful service which is weird bc they weren't busy.  This is a service based city, so waiting for silverware to eat ur food, not to mention a drink to wash it down (wtf) is not a huge request....

The cheeseburger was w/o cheese :( and th bun (while tasty) was a little cold.  The med rare burger had bled badly onto th bun, which is kinda gross... Overall the flavor of the burger was decent, though.  The fries were fine.  With better execution the meal would have been pretty good - - the bad service was the clencher in this case.
