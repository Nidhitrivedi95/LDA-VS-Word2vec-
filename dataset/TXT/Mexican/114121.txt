gEv1Og5uGDLw9HkbKSGUZw I came here for my birthday and had a lot of fun, a friend of mine made the reservations and told them it was my birthday and they were extremely accommodating. 

Great service, great tequila, okay food.
Some of the tacos are better than others and they're pretty small.

I would come here again, this would be a good place to go out for drinks before going out on the town.
