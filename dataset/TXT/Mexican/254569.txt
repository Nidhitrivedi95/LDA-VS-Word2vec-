V9KtZRYkprtkTPMDK31HMA Wow! What can't I say about this place? My partner and I come here every year on our anniversary. It's a great place for live music. The decor will make you feel right at home with a whiskey hot toddy! The bar staff treats you like family while serving up everything from craft beers to perfectly fabricated cocktails. Mostly, the menu is what speaks to a chef. It is thoughtfully executed. Layers of flavor stack on every dish as the kitchen staff works almost around the clock to deliver complex consistency. The menu is a bit larger than most. However, the choices are flawless with touches of a southern inspiration. Beautiful sweet and salty dishes to elevate your taste buds. Not to mention, top notch ingredients! Charlie's is the place to take someone special to enjoy a delicious meal. NOT "bar food". Great place to have a wonderful time no matter what your agenda. I highly recommend checking it out!
