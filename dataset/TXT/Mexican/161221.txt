L-_-9JNAb6UDyq7waykX2A NEVER going back! Food takes FOREVER to be served. Figure about 30+ minutes from the time you're seated to the time your food arrives at your table. Sushi rolls are a little expensive.
 When my wife and I went, we got seated and while we were ordering a party of three was seated next to us. Long story short, after we got done eating ordering desert, eating it and paying (about an hour and 25 minutes) the waitress when to their table to tell them that what they had ordered was out... I was amazed! Not going back. For sure!
