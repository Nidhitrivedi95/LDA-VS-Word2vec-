vBGfITg_FEkFYMQwNagbBA Excellent food and love the staff.  You can't go wrong here.  As soon as you walk in the door you receive a friendly and joyful hello - you feel like you're home. 

The chef is working hard in the kitchen but not to busy to offer you a small sample of home made soup made fresh daily.  I swear, if he wasn't the burrito king he would be the soup nazi - "no soup for you".

If your passing by this small Eglinton Avenue plaza you should drop in for taste of Mexico regardless of where you're from.
