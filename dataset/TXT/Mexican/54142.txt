9qqhdkN4aeE6yvUiKg4F0Q The last time I visited this Chipotle, they had THE nicest staff in the WORLD. I stopped in on my lunch break and left with a huge smile on my face. They were so genuinely personable and nice. Their smiles and great attitudes were worth way more than my food (which was equally as awesome).
