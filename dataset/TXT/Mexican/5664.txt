_6mvQX9x66oz046eS5ii8w Great spot.  It has a family feel which has kept me coming back.  Consistent with quality and priced reasonably well.
I can't recommend just one item. Combo plates are good, enchiladas tasty, nachos and carne fries great.  Don't just drive by, give Juan's a try (see what I did there )
