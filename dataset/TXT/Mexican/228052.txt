S599hCA4kJJO3_b6SRFKoA We went on a Friday evening. 

Food prices were ok. Selection was excellent. Portions were big. Food was delicious, and pretty darn authentic. We had Gallo al Chipotle Estilo Parangaricutirimicuaro, which was delicious. However, the waiter wasn't even surprised that my husband (a white guy) had the name of the dish memorized and pronounced it perfectly :)

A mariachi band performed, and they were truly excellent. I would pay to watch them perform. There was also a gentleman singing and playing a keyboard, who was also good.
