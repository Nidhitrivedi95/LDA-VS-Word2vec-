gOpOoZgrF2shRLCBBzO3Mw Based on the appearance of the aptly named Burrito "Shack" I had low expectations.  I figured anything better than salmonella or the need for a tetanus shot  was a win.  

Wow was I pleasantly surprised.  Now I have been there maybe ten times and it has been fantastic every time.  Great food, great price, huge portions, and they are fast and friendly.  I have had a few different items and nothing has disappointed.  

If you are not on the Burrito Shack bandwagon you are missing out!
