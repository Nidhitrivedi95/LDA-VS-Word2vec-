3dC3opMY67zrquz_yYc-tw So excited this location opens next to the AMC. My hubby tried 3 tacos plate: carne, al pastor, & another one. He loved it! 
I had a carne asada quesadilla and added guacamole on the side. Delicious! Friendly service, very clean restaurant. 
Only thing I'd suggest management change, do NOT charge customers a fee for using their debit/credit card. Thankfully we had cash but I could see other customers annoyed. That's a cost an owner should always eat, not an already paying customer. 
We will definitely be back soon!
