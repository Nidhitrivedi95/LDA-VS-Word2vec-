Voeq7aGDmCGMjE_SQiHwRA I had been to Penn Avenue once before (in 2015). I had seen that there were LOTS of restaurants on this street within walking distance of the Amtrak station.  So I wondered back here today.  Based on Yelp, I decided to try out this place.  I had the guacamole and chips.  Excellent;  loved the chunks of avocado.  Then had two different tacos,  which this restaurant is known for. Loved the pollo rojo taco.  The pork belly taco was pretty good too. I topped it off with a pineapple margarita.  Pineapples are one of my b favorite fruits,  so I really liked this twist on a traditional margarita.  Downside: a bit too noisy for me. If you want to have a conversation with someone,  this isn't the best place to come. As I was by myself,  I could cope.
