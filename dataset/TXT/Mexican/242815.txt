TH_Vr8_LCnAXFDUqSkF-HA I would not go back here. I ordered the all you can eat tacos. I asked for extra tomatoes, and when I received the tacos there were barely any tomatoes (although I did ask for extra!) and I was told I would be charged a dollar for asking for extra. I was not informed about this extra charge when I asked for them. 

The meat in the tacos was room temperature. The plate was hot, but the tacos were not. 

I've been to many Mexican restaurants in the valley, and I would honestly have to say the $1 tacos on tuesdays at Filibertos are better. I will not return here.
