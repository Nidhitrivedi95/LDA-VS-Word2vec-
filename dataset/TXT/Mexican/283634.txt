XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Eaten here many, many times over the years, and up until this last visit, my review would have been 4 or 5 stars. However, Mesa Grill has removed the blue corn tamale replacing it with a garlic tamale. Please, please, please consider going back to the blue corn. The garlic tamale was dry and tasteless. Also the portion for the salad seems to have decreased, but the price doesn't reflect this. 

With all the stellar eating options in Las Vegas, I think it's time we moved on from Mesa Grill.
