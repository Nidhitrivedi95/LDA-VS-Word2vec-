Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ Shrimp tacos were very, very good. I would have liked a little more spicy crema but overall, very good.
 The CW Margarita: OH MY!!! The best in town
We were little disappointed considering this is a Sammy Hagar establishment that the music was all rap and pop. Yeah, yeah, we are rockers and were hoping!!! 
Despite the slow service and music, we really enjoyed the food and more importantly, the margarita! Will definitely go back
