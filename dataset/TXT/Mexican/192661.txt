OMEbwr0Aybw_wnqvno-6zQ This is pretty great Tex-Mex food! The chips are thin and crispy, the sauces are great, and I love the enchiladas. Chuy's enchiladas beat your standard Mexican restaurant enchiladas in my opinion hands down. The tortillas are fantastic too, so you won't get a cold corn tortilla with some last minute sauce thrown on top, the sauce actually soaks through. I usually get the Elves Presley Combo and take home a bit over half every time, because it's SO MUCH FOOD. I like that you can get one of each enchilada (beef, cheese, and chicken) so if you haven't tried their enchiladas, it's a good way to try them. I will say that the regular beef tacos are average, but you can ask for some of the sauces to spice them up, and they do come pretty loaded with filling. I think what I like best is that a lot of the offerings have a little kick to them, and you can taste the fresh ingredients. We haven't had any bad experiences with the servers, and everything's been fine for us. Remember, this is Tex Mex you guys! So don't expect authentic Mexican tacos!
