DKXUkIrFnMUMF535gf-dPA Im from Chicago so Ive had my fair share of authentic mexican food, tacos more specifically. This place has authentic and not so authentic options.

The mini tacos are probably the most authentic thing here since they just come with onion, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime juice. Cant go wrong with a carne asada mini taco here.
Rice and beans are a biiiit on the salty side but still really tasty.

If youre looking for more tex mex style food then go with the regular tacos, they come fully loaded with pinto beans, guac, etc.. burritos are the same.

NOW THE HIGHLIGHT

Those god damn agua frescas man.. I live like .3 miles from this place and in the 1 week Ive been here Ive spent like $40 on these things ($3.50 a piece so you do the math)

Its basically different flavored sweet god like nectar water lol

My favorites are:
Spinach (sounds nasty but it tastes like orange juice)
Watermelon

My absolute favorite which the girl working there recommended is half pineapple and half cucumber. Effing amazing.

I stop by here like every day on the way home to get an agua fresca, it is that good. Just do yourself a favor and get it.
