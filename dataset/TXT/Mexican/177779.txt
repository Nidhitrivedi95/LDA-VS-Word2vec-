mUAEn4Ud0PN-Dv446vhfSg Very loyal local customers here since hunbertos opened, but unfortunately all that just changed.  As their burritos get smaller and smaller,  apparently so does their idea of custumer service. My boyfriend ordered our breakfast burritos and was told there was a wait,  but he counted 8+ burritos being ORDERED,  COOKED,  and SERVED AFTER he ordered while he sat there.  It was like they lost his order.  Accidents happen,  but no apology made for the 30 min+ wait for these burritos that were so filed with potatoes, you wouldn't know they were supposed to be bacon! So sad.
