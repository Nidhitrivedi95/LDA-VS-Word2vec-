osDf5vkpammUvYca4P5z2g This is a KFC and a Taco Bell combined.  This is the closest taco bell to my area and after the last 4x in a row of getting my order wrong I won't ever go back and have lost faith in Taco Bell at other locations also.  

The drive thru is extremely slow all hours of the day.  The employees are grumpy and no smiles are to be seen. Don't dare tell them your order was wrong because they will let you know that YOU must have ordered it incorrectly. 

KFC has the smallest pieces of chicken I have ever seen. Mini chicken farmers must be where they purchase their products. A thigh was about the size of a chicken wing at a pizza parlor.  It's often over fried also. 

Taco Bell my order is ALWAYS wrong. I like extra sauce... If I ask for it I will get NO sauce at all... Every time without fail. So I stated asking for green sauce on the side so I could get my extra sauce.. I have to explain to them to just put it in a container. It's not rocket science. I rarely make special requests like this but if I purchase extra sauce and don't get it this to me is being an untrustworthy company.   I Ussually have missing items, never give napkins in the drive thru either.  My last time there I got someone else order... It was a very large order and I just drove off with it. I was so feed up with the BS and mistakes I kept it. I ordered a burrito and got a meal for 4 LOL.
