iOt7ebp4Zy-5YUjHL1rbmQ Terrible disgusting dried out meat, cabbage looked like someone had chewed it up and spit on my plate. The worst part it took 1 full hour to get the two tacos and the carne asada burro. The salas were flavorless.  The building is nice but the food is something else. Never again will we go there, not impressed.  The one star is for the cool building.
