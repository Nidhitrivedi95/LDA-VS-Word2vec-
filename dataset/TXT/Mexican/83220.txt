D3MfMrIoNV4_aXPj0bi1BQ Lopez initially allures with its red neon sign and suitably dark decor. Inside, it's loud and colorful without being garish, and the servers are quite pleasant. On a recent Friday at 7pm, however, there wasn't a wait, a fact that should have worried your reviewer. Sadly, I was lost somewhere and didn't consider it. Our party was seated briskly and given our complementary chips and salsa--which were no-frills but tasty enough, at least until we reached the bottom of the chip bag (or half bag--one rather wonders what happens to the upper half (one guest suggested their kept on-hand as party hats)) to discover the bulk of the chips were so horribly smashed they looked like a kid had gone at them with a claw hammer. Then came the guacamole with lobster which was dreadfully under-salted and tasted of nothing but the sea. I was stunned by the brininess of each bite. Next, the steak and bleu cheese burrito which seemed oddly stale and overly cheesy (bleu cheese must accent--not be used in a great sticky mass like mozzarella). Though the meat was well-seasoned, the price tag ($17) was absurd--one could get a fresher, tastier burrito at Bakersfield or some decadent tacos at Barrio for a fraction of the price. Lastly, the margaritas were stunningly weak and generic. It pains me not to recommend Lopez, as the decor and service are superb. A restaurant's prowess begins and ends with its food, however, and in a crowded market of high end Mexican food, Lopez simply doesn't cut it.
