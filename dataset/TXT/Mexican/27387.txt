3I4I9C5VN3NIkU1K0Mc01w Got hungry walking around Fremont street and ran into this place. Got the al pastor and chorizo tacos. Both were flavorful and hit the spot. Nice char on the al pastor. Somewhat pricey at $2-$3 per taco but size was decent. I was good with 2. Salsa bar was okay. The only gripe is that the radish seemed old. Other than that, good experience with decent tacos. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but I'd hit it up again for a late night snack.
