j87Y1hyifp-XHN5HuVtpPA Disappointing experience. The mini tacos were surprisingly pretty flavorless and not fresh. The tortillas were chewy/hard? and it was work to get through each taco. my fish tacos were supposed to come wih a creme sauce but there was no sauce and the tacos ended up being very dry because of that. My mans tacos came w rice and beans and lines but mine didn't and it took forever to get those! I'm hoping this was just a fluke but we left feeling bad that we actually paid money for that meal.
