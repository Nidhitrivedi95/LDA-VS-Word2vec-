muefnimyq_3KIdEouJFvrA Sit at the bar to get good service. The corn dip was not good, bland and jus a can of sweet corn thrown in really. I was quickly given the edamame and that was good. It could've used more heat so I got sliced jalapeños. Overall, jus what u would imagine a mall rest/bar to be. Not a destination but a fun stop off.  Wanted to give an extra star for the bar staff but the food......
