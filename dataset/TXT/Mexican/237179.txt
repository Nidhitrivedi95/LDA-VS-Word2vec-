SW6ZQk22G1_CV81_gfnvNQ Went out with my girlfriends for a dinner date. The place isn't bad, but we couldn't be sat until all of us were there, the lighting is dim, as we were sat all the way at the back. They have a short menu. The food was good from what there was to choose from, but I didn't like the plating of the food. They lost points on presentation, in my book. It's a very casual place, so I could understand the platers, but in my books, it was not pretty to eat from.

We were celebrating our friends new jobs so we had shots to toast her, they were $12 each...ouch, that hurt my pocket. Great Tequila, but a lot of money for me to spend on alcohol...I'm not a big drinker.

I would return, but for a very casual meal. I'm a big fan of tacos, and there's are pretty good. I've had better, but La Carnita is pretty good too.
