2IvrdAb6zdxr3ZqplqJHbg Service: 3 stars. Fast but she really didn't do too much.

Food: 1 star. This place does not live up to its name. Not in the least. The Mangorita was baaaad. Food was terrible! Barbacoa tacos were lukewarm. Hubby got Nachos. Again lukewarm. Cheese was gross. Bad day/good day, either way, it is not acceptable on any day to be this bad. Then they have what's called Mexican style and American style tacos. First off, it was awkward when the waiter asked which style we would like. Secondly, I'm American. I love my American style cuisine. But when I go to a restaurant to eat Mexican. I want... wait for it... Mexican style food. If I want a variation, let me ask for it. Also, when I ask for tacos, just give me tasty tacos. I don't care what style you do. Make them good. 

I will say, airport restaurants are hit or miss. Mostly miss. This was a definite miss by a long shot. Walk one shop down and get a Starbucks with one of their box lunches. You'll be happy you did.
