MQEpDvkdL39hh1N0We3Vaw Seems like an average place with average food. 

We only stopped in for a drink but I also utilized the free appetizer offered from the Yelp app! We enjoyed several margaritas and some guacamole. 

The guacamole was decent, however my complaint comes with the tomatoes. There were WAY to many. However it did taste fresh, and had all the right flavors. Next time l will ask that they hold off on topping it with several large scoops of tomatoes. 

Hoping to come back and try some other dishes and give this place a better review!
