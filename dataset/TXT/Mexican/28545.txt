3SLDrXzPmKF0iCY8WriLsA OK...so I've read the reviews, complaints, and compliments given to Chronic Taco, and - based on my experience today - would have to say that hands down, Chronic Taco has its competitors beat.

Not only was the staff friendly, they were quite helpful when - as a new patron of their establishment - it came to me placing my order, answering all of my questions, and recommending particular favorites they have tried.

The portions were quite generous, and, despite previous reports to the contrary, were heated accordingly.

While similar in nature to its competitor's menu, Chronic Taco's flavor choices were right on the mark - savory, and full of favorable spices and herbs. There was enough heat in the food combination to provide excellent flavors, yet it strayed from being offensive to the pallet. 

If you're looking for something quick that will satisfy your appetite, I highly recommend trying this restaurant. You will not be disappointed.
