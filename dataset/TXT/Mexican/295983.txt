ZCe93zAkxr2KOBU1NT0lmg I have been searching for a really good burrito in Arizona.  I went here because some friends recommended this place.  
We ordered a Grilled Asada Burro Dinner.  We had the steak with rice and beans, but asked for it to be placed inside the burrito.  
The person taking our order seemed confused, but did it for us anyway.  The burrito was really tasty.  The meat was very juicy and had the right amount of spices.  I would go back here to eat again, but for $15 for a burro, its quite expensive.
