SormG5HwTFhWrPk8Uog0dw Some people complain about the price, but after you buy a couple tacos and a lame burrito at taco bell you could have had some Chipotle goodness instead.  I've always had great burritos at this location and they keep the (long) line moving quickly.  My only complaint, which goes for Chipotles in general, is that if you eat in, it feels like you're eating in a giant shipping container.
