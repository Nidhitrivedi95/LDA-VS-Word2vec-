6Gm8wh3N-su9wMaYzGreAg I visited this location a couple of years ago for lunch and thought it was decent, but promptly forgot about it. Today I finally returned to give it another try. It's not the Mexican food you'd find somewhere like Texas, but for this area it is pretty decent. 

The entrée portions are huge and the food is A-OK. I like the salsa bar to personalize your food. Today my husband and I had breakfast burritos. They were the largest burritos ever which I wasn't expecting for around $5 a burrito. The burrito was pretty good. It's definitely the best breakfast burrito option near my house. Our order came up quickly as well.
