pwablDuLsQOdpHAEcNFtww I absolutely LOVE Abuelos!  Upon walking in, the actual restaurant is unique and beautiful.  The classic Mexican "old-world" architecture makes you feel like you're in a new world! 

The menu contains so many different delicious options!  From traditional, classic dishes like Tacos and Enchiladas to an assortment of creative seafood options, you will have the hardest time deciding what to order.  I always get the same thing when I come to Abuelos.  It is truly extraordinary!  It's called the Chile Manzanillo.  It's a decent sized poblano chile stuffed with fresh crab and smothered in a lobster, scallop cheese sauce!  They pair it with fresh steamed broccoli and savory Mexican rice.  It's very rich but seriously truly AMAZING!  

You may have a tough time finishing your meal after going through about ten baskets of their great chips and salsa! haha!
