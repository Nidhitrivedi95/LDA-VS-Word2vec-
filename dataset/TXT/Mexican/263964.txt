WB8BmFMORvshjb7tBw0e0Q What a terrific find!   Went with another couple and had a wonderful meal. Table side guacamole with house made chips, shrimp tacos and burrito all were very tasty topped off with a couple of margaritas. Crystal our server was extremely pleasant and attentive. Will definitely be back!!!
