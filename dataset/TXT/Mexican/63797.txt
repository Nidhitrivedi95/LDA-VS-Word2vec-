B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA Fresh option for lunch or dinner and has online ordering! I've gone during the lunch rush and it's not too bad. The line goes by fairly quick and seating wise i would say only seats about 20 people if that. So you may want to plan on coming just before noon or after 1pm. I have ordered online which is extremely simple however sometimes it can take up to 45 for your order to be ready. I recommend just going in! The reason i love this place is because i'm such a fan of their actual sushi restaurant. The quality of fish is great and the services is nothing less than perfect
