DyOzNIeXUksPNLXYHnB-oQ 4 stars for staff friendliness, good ambiance, good crowd (other families there), safe location, and cleanliness.

3 stars for food: my wife, Puerto Rican, and I love Mexican food (for obvious reasons).  Checked this place out and food was OK, nothing to rave about (I know everyone's taste buds are different),  We ordered a variety to try: all 3 tacos, arepas, empanadas, chips and queso.  

TACOS: the taco's were ok (I'm biased, i love hard shell tacos), these were flour and corn tortillas, and I got a combination of beef and steak; definitely was a lot of meat (if you like that), but I like good ratio of meat to added toppings - as a result of meat overload, food was bland, could have used more of the fresh toppings (cilantro, onions, lettuce, tomatoes, etc.).    

AREPA: Next, the arepa, which was just one big sandwhich of pulled chicken and cheese, nothing special besides the bun.  

EMPANADA: The empanada was probably the best, although mostly beef (again) and deep fried... the sauce definitely made it awesome though.  

CHIPS AND QUASO: NOT free, which is my biggest criticism.  Not that I want free stuff or I'm cheap, it's just kind of become an "industry standard" in my opinion, like bread at restaurants.  Finally, queso was average.  

Last point, they DO have a salsa bar, which i love in general, so thumbs up to that.

Conclusion: I would go back for the family-friendly environment and *OK* Mexican food, but only if it was the closest option and I was lazy to venture further.  

Advice to restaurant: add more seasoning and fresh flavors and not just load everything up with meat meat meat!  Other than that, everything else is good :)
