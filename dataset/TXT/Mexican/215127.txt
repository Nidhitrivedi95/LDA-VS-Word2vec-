qxVcSWGKyH3HkkHV8NinDA Food and service were great. In my book Mexican restaurants are largely judged first and foremost by the quality of their Margaritas.

Unfortunately, their frozen Margarita machine had been "broken" for a week. Sounds like it's NOT a priority. I settled for 2 margaritas on the rocks and not even a faint buzz.

I never return to a place I feel like a tourist. I definitely felt this way. Unfortunate for the waitress as it wasn't her fault working for a restaurant they deemed acceptable to offer mediocrity at best for what is a marquee offering for a Mexican restaurant. Penny wise, pound foolish.
