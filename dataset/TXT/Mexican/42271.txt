75u8X_saAIETRHgpECi8YA Cindy, was terrible.  We sat down at 8:15, they close at 9:00pm.  We left at 9:03pm.  She was a beeeeeeee hole the whole time.  Food was actually tasty, but she made it salty...as well as the experience.  We asked the owner as we walked in if it was okay to eat he said it was cool.  First and last experience here...Cindy also made it clear that it was extremely inconvenient to split a tab 4 ways.
