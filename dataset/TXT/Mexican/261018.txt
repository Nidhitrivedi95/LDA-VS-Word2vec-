VRwT0pscR5vESCrAnUpNwQ The tacos here are heavy af compared to other tacos at more authentic Mexicana joints. Service was quick, and their sauce bar stole my fricken heart. I'd gotten the pork taco, and it honestly felt like half a meal for me (but I'm a pretty light eater in general). The meat was goddamn near tender and very filling. Recommended is three tacos for a full meal, but I was pretty anxious to try the corn- grilled and season to perfection. It's a great appetizer to share with one other person, since it's two halves of a corn. Definitely would come back for a quick lunch!
