ddplAthoA2pGLoSqhHpVkA Went in to get dinner for the family around 4:30ish. Ordered my food and when I went to pay the guy behind the counter didn't know how to use the credit card machine. I stood there for about 5 minutes while my food was being made, while he called another store or someone else to figure out how to use the credit card machine. He hung up and asked if I had any cash. OF COURSE I DONT. THATS WHY IM USING MY CARD.
