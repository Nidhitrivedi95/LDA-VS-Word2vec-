ti1bb30WwnkDLuVvpTM6fQ I'm really not a fan of Spanish seafood joints, but the in-laws want to roll by this place before a nite of Daddy Yankee VS Don Omar at the Grand Garden Arena.   We had the Piña mix seafood and the shrimp empanadas with the "free" deep fried ice cream (just for checking in on Yelp).  Didn't really care for the Piña since the pineapple made the dish a little sweeter than I liked.  The wife enjoyed the empanadas with her Micheladas.  Our daughter had the carne burritos, but nothing to write home about.  All in all... 2.5-3 stars due to slow, but nice service.   At least they had a couple of big screens on the wall playing the NBA finals and international soccer games.  

However, 2 for 1 Micheladas will most likely have the wife and in-laws wanting to frequent this joint, but I think my daughter and I will say... "thank you, but no thank you please".
