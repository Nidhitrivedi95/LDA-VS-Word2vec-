KCQNEIvtU48Mh07uS-_Gvw Ordered on the app, it took 30 minutes to get our food once we got there, and when the food came out, we didn't have our iced coffee. So we asked for it THREE different times to three different people and it still took 20 more minutes for it to come out. But when we got the iced coffee, it was in a hot coffee cup. We took the lid off, and there was hot coffee with very melted ice cubes. We asked why it wasn't iced and the cashier said it was! And then offered to add more ice. We asked for a cup for soda instead and he looked at us like we were from mars. On top of all that, during all of this, at one point the guy at the register reached over and started touching my hair without my consent. Worst Taco Bell experience in my life.
