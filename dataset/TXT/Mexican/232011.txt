Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg Great authentic Mexican spot for lunch. I had the #7 lunch and my wife had the Tacos Aguacate. I enjoyed the flavors and spice typically found in most Mexican dishes. We had great service and the chips and salsa were tasty too. Parking is easy and available. Prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was nice as well.
