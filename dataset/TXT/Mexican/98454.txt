EP1do6l8hLyIGEru0gN3EQ One of my favorite casual, fun spots in Cleveland. I miss going to Johnny Mango on a warm summer day. I'd hit it up after rollar blading at Edgewater Park and chill out with a fresh watermelon juice margarita with a sugar rim. Ooooohhhhh YEAH! The best drink evahhhhh. 

Sigh... I miss the mango!
