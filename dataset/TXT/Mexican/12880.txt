0fyxLMASE5bfYAgW6MYM_g So I am a regular at this restaurant. I order one specific thing every time. This visit was sad to say the least. I had a new waitress. I ordered my food the way I always order it the same way. On this visit my waitress could not get my order correct. My food came out  wrong. I sent it back it came out Wrong again. I told the waitress it was wrong she proceeded to get the manager. The manager walked over to my table with an attitude and said, "what do you want?"  I proceeded to tell her and she said I can't order it that way. I have been ordering it that way for a long time. She brought me my food finally. Although she has now lost a regular for the restaurant. My regular waiters/waitresses I am sorry your female manager with tattoo on her arm was so rude. I am taking my money else where!
