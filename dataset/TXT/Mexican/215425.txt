QYuojrlW94mpEwnp0uUIWA This is my second time eating at the lab and it's still delicious. I've had the guacamole burger and now the A1 burger and they're both totally delicious. I also had the cinnamon toast milk shake and yum!!! The staff seem really passionate about the food and it shows. I'm so glad I found this place though Yelp go eat some yummy burgers!!!
