znNyiHZs5TAX64WonjJ4dg Entertainment for the evening.  After careful consideration can I have a chicken taco on a flour tortilla and a shredded beef with a crispy shell...response no we don't have a chicken taco's on a flour tortilla that would be a burrito...no I'm 100% sure that a chicken taco on a flour tortilla is still a taco...sorry we don't offer those....and we should raise minimum wage to what?????

Follow up, I acquiesced.  Crunchy chicken tacos are ok too and for a discounted price on taco Tuesday a good deal, I'm over it and back in the fan club.
