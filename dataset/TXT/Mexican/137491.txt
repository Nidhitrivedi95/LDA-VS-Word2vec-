ITOa1olD2HTgEVOnH8zVog It's a genuine Mexican restaurant.  If you are looking for good Mexican food, please come here.  I'm not afraid to admit I am a VERY frequent diner.  I'm close to trying everything on the menu.  Their quesadillas are a very nice size perfect for sharing if you are not very hungry or if you want leftovers.  The meet is perfectly cooked and the spices and salsa defiantly have a kick but not overpowering.
