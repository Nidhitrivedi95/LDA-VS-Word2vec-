1dhPgc7E7IzzpxjHM2LphQ Rumor has it this is Mel Gibson's favorite mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh, and with very good reason!  Be on the lookout for their new sister joint, Mad Mex Beyond Wingdome, which is set to open soon, underneath the unicorn mural in the Strip District.  You're going to want to hold on to your hats for that one, as they are taking Mad Mex's famous "road warrior" approach to traditional Oaxacan cuisine to an entirely new level.  Some might say that some of their food is unnecessarily dangerous, but if you've ever had their mole electric eel taco platter, a steal at $17, you'll know that it's more than worth the risk.  And if you haven't had their piranha-and-potato burrito - also for $17, as is everything else on their menu - you simply haven't lived.  I'm not sure if there's outdoor seating or not, I'm going to have to go back to find out. Maybe I'll see Mel there!
