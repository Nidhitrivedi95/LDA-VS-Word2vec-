BQJokxJ4y4s57i7Mn65pvA This was the second mexican restaurant we visited while here. It is a bit pricey for what you get but that's what happens when you eat at a hotel restaurant. Great flavored salsas. Had the tres Carne enchiladas (shredded pork, shredded beef, and Carne asada) - couldn't pick a favorite between the three since they all were good. Rice was uneventful. Our server was great, very attentive and funny.
