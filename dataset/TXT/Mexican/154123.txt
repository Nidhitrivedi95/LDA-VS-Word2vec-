K-uQkfSUTwu5LIwPB4b_vg Had a great lunch today at The Mission in Old Scottsdale .... Ask for Kate ... She was the best! She recommended the pork shoulder taco (their specialty is pork) which was terrific. My wife had the Cubano, again a great recommendation! Great food, great ambiance, great waitress. A strong recommendation !
