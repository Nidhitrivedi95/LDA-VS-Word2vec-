wGSx98wpsI7dijynSNxR1A All I can say is WOW!! I have been to a few taco trucks in my day, and this is the tastiest, fastest, and most yummy food your buck. Literally. I order two chicken tacos with cilantro, no onion. NORMALLY, I get just that, two little chicken tacos with only cilantro, and usually at least after 10 minutes of waiting. Not here at Los Amigos. The woman that works the window is so sweet, and just kept asking if I want to add cheese, lettuce, sour cream, guacamole. I was pleasantly surprised, and said please. She also asked if I wanted chips and beans on the side. I was like, WHAT?! Yes, please. While I was standing there talking to her, I grabbed a package of cookies for my 4 year old. I asked her what the total was, I brought a $20 bill. She replied, that will be $4 please. I was in shock. I paid, and of course tipped. And then the cook, who I think is her Dad, hands her my plate so she can cover it in foil so I can go. The portion for these two chicken tacos is amazing, and the chips and beans, in under 3 minutes...come on!!Unreal, and I will be going back tomorrow!!
