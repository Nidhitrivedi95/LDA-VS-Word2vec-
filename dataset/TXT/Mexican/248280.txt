u7jiuYiz-zVwsh0TGRHUIg I love Burrito King- it's amazing and delicious. Their service is awful in terms of timing. Pick up orders say they'll take 20 minutes and EASILY take an hour. This has happened every single time I've ordered there and it sucks but I keep going back because I love the food. Really hope they make some improvements with organization because their poor timing isn't due to being insanely busy. Le sigh.
