XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Being asked to remove my hat prior to being seated as if I am some common riff raff without basic table manners is insulting enough, but then finding that the possibility of my hat being so offensive to the other diners in my section sipping from hand grenades they brought in whilst wearing sports jerseys and concert t-shirts over the bray of young children that it needed to be done with zero tact by the receptionist was particularly over the top.  

Be casual or be dressy, but don't be a little of both and unable to communicate your schizophrenic expectations without a bit of courtesy. 

At least the food is good.
