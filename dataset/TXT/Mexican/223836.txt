What I dislike about this place is that you have to stand in the line for the type of tacos your want. What if you want steak and beef? Well you have to get in another line which is time consuming and unorganized. I wanted fries with my tacos but felt so rushed at the front, it just didnt seem like an option

The 3 tacos were absolutely delicious and fulfilling though and I got everything on them. (Sidenote: My friend and I stomachs but got messed up later/day after because of these tacos. Could just be a single experience but still-it was the only thing we really ate that day). Doesnt' take from how good the tacos were. 

If you have time to waste and want to stand in line for some good tacos, recommended by so many, then definitely stop here.
