S3qs5ZAZgqDvM88jj17hbQ Chips and salsa, en gratis. Chips are super salty but the salsa is sweet and yummy and it's free so it's like complaining about Facebook. 

Server is a sweet, helpful, cutie but bar service is slower than Michael Johnson in the 150M against Donovan Bailey. Order a drink and when it comes order another upon delivery. 

Food is surprisingly good. Order the Scorpion drink. Tequila maks ebtnshg btr.
