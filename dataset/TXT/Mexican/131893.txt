ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA I was nervous about having dinner here with all the negative reviews. I'm a local and wanted to hang out in downtown Las Vegas and was craving some good Mexican food. This place was great! Salsa excellent.. Flavor and a bit of spice. Had the house margarita and it was wonderful. I shared the flautas and chicken burrito with my boyfriend. We both thought it was excellent and would go back in a heartbeat. I've been to most of the Mexican restaurants in downtown Las Vegas. If you want to hang out off Fremont street then this is your place! Enjoy - I'll be back!!
