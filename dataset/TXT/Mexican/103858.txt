fbQaKW0Lte0JQ_opbnjdKg Thank you Yelpers for helping on this one.

For my first night in PHX I wanted Mexican but was not sure of just where. I stumbled on this place with the guidance of Yelp.

I was smart to look online in the parking lot to check out the menu so I could get a feel for how it worked, what they had etc. This was a good move, the menu is a chalkboard that is about 15' long and above the counter so you feel like you are trying to look for Haley's comet while reading the menu. This is not a criticism just an observation.

Now the food, this is high end Mexican fusion. You pick everything to make your custom enchiladas. The meat the sauce you name it everything is yours to choose. And it's really hard as they have VERY good ingredients.

I went for 2 'ladas 1 green chile pork shoulder, and 1 briased beef short rib, then I went Chirstmas with the sauce (1 red and 1 green). FRom here you can add a fired egg, more cheese, hand made quac. The whole enchilada is here... unless you want this as a taco then its the whole taco.

If you are in the PHX area drop in get some enchiladas or tacos and let me know what you think. Remember to check out the menu before you go your neck will thank you.
