ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA Not sure what's wrong with people who are giving this place a bad rap. This is a gentrified hipster Mexican restaurant that has great food. Service is great and drinks decent. I don't write too many reviews but thought they should receive some positive feedback because they're doing a great job. Thanks guys!
