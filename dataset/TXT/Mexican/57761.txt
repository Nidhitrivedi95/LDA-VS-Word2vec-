Although they are in Birkdale, they are tucked in the back as opposed to on the main drag, so you will likely only see the place if you are purposefully looking for it. Once we finally found it, we went in and stood at the front and looked around and saw just a few diners, but no staff.  After a minute or two, we were about to leave, when someone came and greeted us.  After that rough start, the service was friendly. They serve complimentary chips and salsa. I did not have any of the salsa, but it looked good. The mahi mahi fish tacos were very good, but be warned that they are spicy.  The Mexican Street Corn is awesome.  I did not care for the fried plantains, but they were prepared fine. I'd just never had plantains before and found that maybe they aren't my thing.  I'd say give this place a shot if you are a fan of trying different kinds of tacos. The prices are very reasonable, but I think they could get more business if they would advertise more and let people know, "Hey, we're back here."
