7GGJlp1aWfcXGQz6q7SkXQ In Vegas for Super Bowl and my buddies and I stopped in at the Rock House to have some drinks and get something to eat.  We were promptly seated by the hostess and it went downhill from there.  We waited nearly 20 minutes before a waitress showed up.  We had waited so long we had all decided what we were going to eat in addition to our drinks.  She took our drink orders but refused to take our food order also.  Another 10 minutes elapsed before our drinks arrived by another waitress who also declined to take our food order.  We waited approximately 30 minutes before another waitress showed up to take our food order.  The ironic thing is the restaurant was nearly empty.  Food arrived rather quick but it was so bad I could not finish my chicken and avocado sliders.  It tasted like gas station food.  I asked for the tab so I could get out of there because the service and food  was so bad.  It took nearly an hour.  I finally got a hold of two separate servers before our bill was presented.  I do not recomemmend Rock House.  There is an obvious problem with management and training.  Staff was rude.  Bottom line, eat somewhere else.
