JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg My kids took me here for my Birthday. My daughter highly recommended this place. Food was good. Loved the salsa that came with the chips. Best margaritas. However, we had very mediocre service. Two guests at the table one that works at a high end restaurant the other works at a large casino in  "Guest Experience " said this  service would have not been tolerated. It was a Saturday night but not busy.  I suggest go during the week. I normally would give two stars but the food was good.
