moZpwq1hNxC-uJRpfupOTA This has been a fave of ours and a place we bring out of town friends for years. My husband always has the carne adovada plate, which we first learned of from a Phoenix Magazine best dishes of the valley issue. THe patio is so great for all but the midst of summer. Great margs and happy hour they are a deal and some great food deals, too. The filet tacos are my favorite. Last time hubby had the amazing meatloaf...wow! Tony was our waiter tonight and once before...he's great...super helpful, friendly and a sense of humor. Two of us had the pasta special tonight and while it was not as flavorful as we had hoped, we still love this place.  Our friends insist we come here when they visit and we are happy to oblige!
