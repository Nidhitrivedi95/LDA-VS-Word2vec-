xkdgCrkgfbI80Htst6-Lbw Ridiculously fast?  Yeah, particularly the 'ridiculous' part.  I've never been rushed through any meal quite like the last time I went to Laredo's.  I think me and my dining companion were seated and back out the door in under a half hour.  That's practically fast food-caliber fast.  When my food is that fast, I don't really enjoy myself.  I feel like I'm in a race to see who can cram the most Mexican food in their stomach first.  I think maybe if I were going there for lunch on my work hour, I'd appreciate the fastness more.

That said, the food is always delicious and reasonably priced.  I particularly enjoy their different flavors of margaritas.  Also, they have good lunch specials.
