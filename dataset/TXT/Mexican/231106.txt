SKGTOUDKKhkPQG-Yjfvbdw Holy scrumptious batman! This is the best burrito I have ever had. Ever.
The staff are friendly (and helpful if you're a newby) and the burrito was tasty and full of yummy ingredients.

I had the baked chicken burrito with guac, beans, green peppers, rice, and tomatoes.
I got the "Lil" burrito because I knew I'd never be able to polish off a "regular" size, and it was just right for me.

I will be back you Fat Bastard.
