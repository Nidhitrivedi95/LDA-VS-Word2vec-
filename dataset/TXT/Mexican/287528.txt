ydqbNz2sHENV9XOElwyAYA This is an incredible Mexican restaurant! I truly have not been to such a wonderful place with tremendous authentic Mexican food with a flair.

The service and people are incredible and the prices are very fair.

It's got it all: friendly and efficient service, good food, A great location, and great prices. I will be back here when I'm next in Scottsdale.
