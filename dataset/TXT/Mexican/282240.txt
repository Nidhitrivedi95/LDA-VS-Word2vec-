XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Came and ate here with some friends at lunch before leaving Vegas.

Corn chowder was spicy and delicious
Pork tenderloin sandwich with arugala was dry and ok tasting
Free bread basket with blue corn muffins and jalepeno bread was amazing

Service was prompt and attentive. Nice view into the kitchen. I would definitely need to come again and try something else on the menu.
