Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ What a great atmosphere. Authentic Mexican in a cool place. I wasn't sure what to order so I asked the server. He put a combo together that wasn't on the menu so I could try both items I had asked about. I had the shrimp and crab enchilada and a steak taco. So good! My husband had the nachos as he wasn't hungry. He said the meat was perfect. Would come again and again!!!
