5OAO9TxfvsvccFFD4pjmeg Just came back from dinner.  I agree that it's authentic but much better Mexican restaurants are to be found in Toronto.  The margaritas are in a word - terrible - and I can't figure out what went wrong but didn't even taste like tequila.  The tortilla soup was very good, guacamole was fair -avg but my main of enchiladas was poor, very soggy and bland.  Very disappointed in food but most disappointed in drinks. We usually go to Miriachi on Young which is reasonably close and really regret not going there tonight as their margaritas are perfection and their food is higher quality.
