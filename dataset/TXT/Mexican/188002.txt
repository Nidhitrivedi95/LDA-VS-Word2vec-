O3y-5O1n5l0ge_6KGyR_4A Let me preface this review by saying that I have grown up in orange county and san diego with a plethora of great Mexican food. 

I came to Fausto's because I had been thinking about Mexican food for a while. I had just moved to the area and heard that this was the best Mexican around. After placing my order for a carne asada breakfast burrito, I took a peek at the salsa bar. I must say that it was fairly disappointing...They did not have any pico de gallo which was a bummer and the other sauces looked meh. 

When I got my burrito, it was so.... small (thats what she said). I expected a little bit more in portion size. In addition, the carne asada was not what I expected. Rather than having a distinct beefy taste, it had the texture/taste of the sausage toppings on a pizza. It tasted like beef, but a little bit off. 

I will try this place a few more times to see if it improves.
