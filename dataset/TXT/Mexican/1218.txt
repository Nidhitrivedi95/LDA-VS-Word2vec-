-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg Awesome place! The wait time is usually pretty long but definitely worth it (for those tacos!) and you can always buy a beer while you wait. Environment is great and the people work as a team there. Bartenders are cool as shit and always stay on top of their people! Always enjoy going back!
