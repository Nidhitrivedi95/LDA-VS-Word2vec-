ms7cmWkPiSBDTnz-1sv2kQ I'm a little bit in love with Ticoz right now. 

What did it?
$2 margarita Wednesdays, of course!
Delicious and strong. We've been going weekly to taste all of the different flavors. The passion fruit one is my favorite at the moment. 

The martini's are also fantastic, but I can't afford those all the time :)

I don't always order food, but when I do I am pleased as punch. I had veggie enchiladas and everything on my plate was delightful. I've also had the caesar salad, which was crisp and zingy and perfect. 

I'm happy with the service. Ricky is my favorite. I also adore the sweet young man who works the bar. 

We had a weird experience the other night though, when an employee kept hitting on my date (HELLO! GAY RESTUARANT! SHE'S A DYKE, BACK OFF! Silly boy) but that has never happened before. 

Now that we have a card that tells us what the daily drinks specials are, we will surely be back more often. We'll be there on Wednesdays, of course, if nothing else!
