FI-8LPGkc8D_hwx0l0zyyg I took off a star because I think some of the menu items are overpriced and the place was REALLY loud. Turn the music down just a bit. Overall the decor lends a cool vibe and the service was excellent... Not too pushy, not too distant. We had three people and split two cheese crisps and an order of tacos and we had stuff to take home. The cocktails were also really good and not full of sweeteners. Mama like!
