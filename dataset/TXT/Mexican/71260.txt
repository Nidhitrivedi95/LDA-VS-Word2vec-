C2BR0TjNacoNzItPLUHTAA I would rate this place a 3.5 stars if I could... Because service is great and very friendly. Their coconut shrimp was delicious, amazing, and I'd go back for it. However their claim to fame was apparently their fish tacos. And these tacos were not as good as I expected. The fish was dry. And I mean very dry. Tastes like chicken dry. I had to force it down it was that dry!!! :( and they dip it into this flavoring sauce that makes the tortilla all soggy which made it hard to eat. The taste was ok, not great not bad, but the sogginess was what really ruined it for me. It's not a taco when you only eat the filling with a fork! And this claim to fame makes me question how good their other items are. Had I not gotten that coconut shrimp order, I would have given this place 3 stars. All in all I would only come back for their coconut shrimp and I would never eat their fish again. Customer service is nice so No hard feelings with the employees working.
