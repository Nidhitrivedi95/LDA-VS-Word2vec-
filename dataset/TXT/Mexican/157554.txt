KMxOoHyRKP74PgosuRkkdg I love this place. Whenever I want authentic food, quick and convenient I stop by after work. It's always clean in there and the staff is helpful. I usually get the ribeye tacos (highly recommend), because they are my favorite.  Today I tried the flautas, which were good but I much more would rather have the tacos. I enjoy it every time I go. I would recommend anyone to stop in.
