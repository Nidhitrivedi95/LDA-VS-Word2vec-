2PnRXLAN3KFEu4g0OUL2iw I was craving a breakfast burrito and yelped a place close by ... That's how I found Señor Taco. 

The burrito was okay.... 

What did I get? 
The chipotle crunchy burrito... It had egg, bacon, tortilla chips, and chipotle sauce with cheese. 

Cost?
$7 - Yikes! Kinda pricey for a breakfast burrito
