svdEhLmNmpVaIv1WLtoOvQ I'm only giving 4 stars for the food, not the service. I had a raspberry margarita that was amazing. I also got 2 carne asada tacos and 1 lengua. The meat itself had very great flavor and the toppings tasted just as great as they looked. The overall presentation of the food was pleasing. 
I do have to say that the waiter hardly came to the table. Anytime something was needed, which was rare, we had to flag him down. Once the order was put it, drinks and food came out quickly.
