zS3-CKZVVvUYvasJnAg-aA I got the #10 carnitas plate and for 8 bucks holy smokes there was a ton of grubbing going down, the carnitas were off the hook! Crispy and tender and not too salty,  place is busy and tables were dirty if that's a problem for yah but that doesn't equate in my reviews only awesome food, totally going back for some cabeza tacos
