oxv2UyI5yF6yawPU20tOxA This restaurant exceeded my expectations. I'm visiting friends in Arizona and we decided to go here because of how cute the outdoor area is. It is beautiful and the food was delicious and the drinks were as well. All of us loved our food. We got the red enchiladas, tacos and chips and salsa. The plates of good were so big and the service was great as well. Our waitress was so friendly and helpful about everything since it was our first time there. Next time I am in town I will definitely be going back.
