9SQjISnyclrVVAS1FlzE-g I'm gonna say it... Café Rio was created like 10 years before this place, and it's the EXACT same thing. Costa Vida just ripped it off (aluminum containers, revolving tortilla grill, ordering style) and added nachos so as to not look conspicuous (that's my best guess anyway). Nevertheless, my burrito was really good. Their horchata was horrible, and it made my entire life sad. But again, good burrito.
