42TGx8KatGNPCi7rwOzazg We were excited that a new Mexican restaurant opened in the Huntersville area.  I'm not a fan of the bland plates served at most Mexican restaurants where the canned refried beans, rice, and cheese is piled high on every dish.  

The menu at Verde is well thought out and diverse.  We have dined there at least 5 or 6 times and have been pleased with the food and friendly service each time.  Dishes we would recommend: Enchiladas Suiza, Chicken or Steak Fajitas, Pibil (pork) entree, and Tres Leches with Passion Fruit layer for dessert.   The menu is a little pricey compared to cheap family-style places nearby.  Entrees are in the $15 range.

Atmosphere, food, and service make this a strong 4-5 star option.  I don't understand the reason behind the negative reviews.  It seems that those who wrote negative reviews based on pricing or lack of cheap tacos would find Taco Bell or La Unica a better fit for their budgets.  If you don't mind paying for a good meal, friendly service, and nice atmostphere, give it a try. You won't be disappointed.
