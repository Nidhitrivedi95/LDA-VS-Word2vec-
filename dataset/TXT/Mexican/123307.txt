This is a great Salvadorian restaurant. My favorite things to get are yuca con chicharrón, pupusas revueltas, and tacos al pastor. The chicharrón here isn't like pork cracklings, it's tender and moist although I'm not sure how they prepare it. The fried yuca is good although it could be cut thinner, but that's just my preference. Pupusas for anyone who isn't familiar are similar to a quesadilla, but the meat (revuelta would be pork) is a finer consistency and the edges are sealed. They make their own corn tortillas, so the tacos as always great. It would help to know some Spanish, but it's definitely not necessary.  

Also Friday is dollar pupusa day and Sunday is dollar taco day!
