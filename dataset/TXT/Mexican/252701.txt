UtZgmOHDW_fbXasbTuZhWA First, let me say the food was delicious once I finally got it.  That, and the fact that several crew members were genuinely concerned about the time it was taking to get my meal, are the reasons for 3 stars on this trip.   Otherwise, this experience would warrant 1 star.

I ordered the Turkey Bacon Melt during breakfast hours.  But since the entire menu is available all day, that shouldn't have been a problem.  I was with friends and we ordered separately.  My friend and I both ordered shakes.  She received her shake and I continues to wait for mine...for about 10 minutes total.  Finally got the shake.  At 16 minutes, I inquired about my meal.  The crew member agreed 16 mins was excessive.  Another crew member stopped by and also checked on my food.  

After 22 mins, my food arrives, but was made incorrectly.  I sent it back.  6 mins later, my new meal arrived.  It was delicious!  However, I find it odd that a manager never stopped by to discuss this situation.  Ultimately, I'm not impressed by the lack of concern shown by a manager, but I was genuinely impressed with the crew members.  I will be back and hope to have a better experience.
