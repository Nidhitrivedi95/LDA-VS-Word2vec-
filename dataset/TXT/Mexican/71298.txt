C2BR0TjNacoNzItPLUHTAA Incredible first experience! The experience started with SINCERELY friendly staff. I went with a friend and we declared to our order taker that it was our first time there. She was patient, detailed, provided her favorite meals and why. The fish tacos were sensational!! A perfect flavor and texture balance. We were checked on 2-3 times during our short stay. Each time it was a different staff member, each time with that same sincere caring about our experience. BRAVO TEAM!
