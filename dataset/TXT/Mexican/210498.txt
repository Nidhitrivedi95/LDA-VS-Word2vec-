qnn9E-e9orYf_wK37yLTYw Yummy margaritas and chips! The quesadilla was delicious, too, though a little different than the usual ones you get in restaurants (flatter without any sour cream or quacamole on the side - but I don't usually eat that stuff anyway). Didn't try any of the other food but I definitely will the next time I'm there. I loved the "upscale, casual" atmosphere and inside/outside dining. Go there. You won't be sorry...unless you don't like Mexican food.
