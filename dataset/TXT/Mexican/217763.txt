r8Jr-7YfkhJL2nxk9lxUNg I came to Frank's and Finas Restaurant highly recommended. We came hear to celebrate  my birthday.  The place is nice very friendly staff and atmosphere was nice. A little long wait on our food. As the restaurant wasn't to busy.  I was treated to a nice Mexican frozen ice cream which was a surprise but I did receive  a surprice. There was a long hair in my ice cream . Other than that I guess it went well. S@$$ happens.
