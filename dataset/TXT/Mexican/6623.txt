_H4GXECi4nHfJTz4dsQV_w I seriously crave this place everyday. There was one day I drove all the way to Rita's on a Sunday only to discover they were closed.
And I was so sad because all I wanted to do was just devour their green chili relleno burrito. They have amazing customer service as well. There was one girl that just made my day. She took my order and then proceeded to take interest in how my day was going, and that she loved my hair. It's just the small things that make the experience so much better. Seriously recommended this place! Their Mole burrito is pretty tasty as well.
