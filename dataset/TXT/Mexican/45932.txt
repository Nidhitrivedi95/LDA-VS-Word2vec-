7Q2cYSl5NBYytJzgjX0oKw Always was a big fan of Sandbar in my time living in Scottsdale - a nice place to sit outside and enjoy a few beers in the sunshine! They also have loads of big TV's that always have sports on for you to watch.

Price wise it's pretty good and they have happy hours a lot - Sunday being a good one as you can get pints of Dos Equis for $3 a pop! They do have a fair sized food menu but I've only ever had the chips & queso - which was very tasty I must say.

In the later hours this place dims the lights and it becomes more of bar/nightclub type place as they often have a DJ on and space is cleared for people to dance. I prefer visiting earlier in the day but both offer a less pretentious options for a few drinks compared to Old Town substitutes.
