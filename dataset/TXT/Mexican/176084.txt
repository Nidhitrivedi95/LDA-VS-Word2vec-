mqqpu_OBoaQmtA4wFfG-Yg ZTejas @ Scottsdale Fashion Square has been a family favorite for about 15 years now! We've seen a lot of changes over the years however, some things haven't changed a bit! They still have one of the best happy hours in town! The frozen margaritas are a great way to relax at the end of the week. Make sure you have a designated driver or an Uber so you don't have to drink and drive. They're pretty potent! Their food is always fresh and delicious. The table side guacamole is so fresh, it's prepared right at your table. Some of our other favorites are the shrimp tostada bites, fish tacos, chicken quesadilla, mushroom enchilada, ruby trout dinner, pork verde and last but not least the Z burger. Another reason we love Z's is the outstanding service! We are always greeted and seated by a friendly host/hostess, who makes every effort to accommodate our seating preference (which by the way is the mall/inside patio). Our server Alex, provides excellent customer service, and is attentive to our needs. He works hard, making sure that everything is just right. He even knows what we like to order and will deliver our drinks minutes after we've arrived. Every time we are at Z's they make us feel like they appreciate our business. It's perfect for couples, families, girls (or guys) night out, birthdays, New Years, upcoming Cinco de Mayo, or our favorite "Friday Family Fun Night"! I would highly recommend Z's any night of the week!
