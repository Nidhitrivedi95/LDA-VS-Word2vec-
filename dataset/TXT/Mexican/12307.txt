We like to dance not just wave your hands in the air in a crowded area. Diablos was perfect and the music was just on point. Almost as if they had my playlist playing. Haha. They had a live band which was really good. They played bachata and salsa. And once they took a break the dj took over. The bar area is really convenient right next to the dance floor. Service was quick, our drinks came out really good. Can't wait to come back here again for Latino Nights only. Not to mention there was no cover charge and we got there after 930pm. That's a big thumbs up!! I'd definitely recommend this place to couples looking for a good place to dance and enjoy something REAL dancing music and are trying to try something different other then EDM n HIP HOP.
