What was all but usual - quite unusual really - were the wood paneled walls. Straight outta grams basement!

All considered, it's pretty cheap for the giant serving sizes, and just the way I wanted to spend my gloomy Saturday afternoon while in Cleveland: Afternoon margs, endless chips and salsa, good company, and did I mention the margaritas?
