woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ This is such a great Mexican restaurant! My friend and I came here for dinner on a Sunday night (7:45pm was the earliest reservation we could get... it's always busy here!)  I ordered the Squash Blossom tacos and Heirloom corn tacos... both were specialities of the season.  My friend ordered the Poke and Mushroom tacos.. also excellent!  For dessert we got the Ice Cream Tacos.  The staff was very friendly and the waitress even paid for our dessert because she had mis-told us about the options still available at the kitchen.  Highly recommend and definitely worth the wait!
