Or7FgbgY8ML30zgYj_DCwA I had my second visit to this restaurant tonight, and now I'm even more convinced that this is now on my "fave" list.  

We ordered the guacamole, chicken burrito and enchilada platter. The portions were more than generous and everything was delicious! Last time I was there I ordered the shrimp tacos which were great as well.

Service was great, drinks were tasty. All in all an awesome dinner. Would definitely recommend if you are looking for good Mexican food in York Region!
