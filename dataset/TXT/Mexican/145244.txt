JgtawtDX0Oie8ZXz2NfjYQ This is Elyria's new hot spot Mexican place. The decor inside was glorious along with the surprising spaciousness. The bar area is rather small. I wouldn't recommend going here to just drink at the bar. As for the food, I kept it basic and ordered soft tacos. They were delicious, as for the margaritas I was disappointed. I was told they only have lemon margaritas. No lime or any other flavor offered. This was very surprising for a Mexican place.To be honest, the margaritas were not very good. So I then proceeded to drink Coors. Servers were knowledgeable and social. The atmosphere is tranquil and welcoming. For a new restaurant, I think this will being in some much needed business to the right side of the Chestnut Commons area.
