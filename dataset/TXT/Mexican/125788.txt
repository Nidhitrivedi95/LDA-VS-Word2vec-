HTlsBAd9j1wlWDHxnYczBw I literally just called this restaurant to see if they had a truck. The lady that answered the phone proceeded, in a rude tone I might add, to say "no,no,no" before I could even finish my sentence. As I was formulating my follow up question, she hung up! I was looking to have them cater for an office event for over 300 people, but based on that first impression I would rather give money to an establishment that values GOOD customer service.


After the above review was posted the owner reached out to me directly and was apologetic. I truly appreciate him taking the time to reach out me. Andrew you're awesome!!!
