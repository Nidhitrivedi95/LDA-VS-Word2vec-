9Jc3W0aR9Xf2gcHI0rEXsw we couldn't understand the hostess, our table was dirty and sticky, our server was in a terrible mood, it took forever to get our shake but it was tasty. almost ten mins later we finally got our food and then or soda after. food was terrible... it's a "bur
ger bar" but the burgers were gross, greasy, overcooked, and tasteless! So we asked for the manager and got nothing but attitude, she finally showed up 15 mins later.  She was nice enough and zeroed our bill finally. At least we got a good shake... happy anniversary to us, what a nightmare!
