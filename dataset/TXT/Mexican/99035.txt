Es-MfCr79uHI-CSrzkea-w I've been here a few times over the years, it's just not the same place... I use to get taco salads quite often but the taste has gone down hill. The other day I ordered a salad with chicken and it was not pretty, not taste bland - lets just say I could have made this in 10 seconds with harris teeter lettuce and chicken LOL - the fajitas were AGIAN bland not really any spice Needed salt and just the service is not up to par. They need to visit CABOS and see how a real Mexican restaurant is run and aura should feel.
