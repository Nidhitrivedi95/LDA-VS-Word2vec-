QDRFdG8gPPKL7r4yic8j7Q I hate to add this review, as this HAD been one of my favorite places, but wow, the quality (AND THE QUANTITY!) have gone way, way downhill here, while the prices have gone up. Sadly, the last few times I've ordered my food, the meat had been dried (burnt carne asada one time) and the tortillas soggy. The guac was NOT fresh, and is more of a ..cream? now instead of actual guacamole. 

I won't be coming here anymore.
