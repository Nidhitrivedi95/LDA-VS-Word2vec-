4DLsC4BTUoEqFGusetQVlQ First thing that I have to say is that I have had a lot of Mexican and Tex-Mex all over Canada and the US.
I love the atmosphere, it is just beautiful and very clean. The staff is also great.
We had the tacos, for lunch. I think they were ok, as I really didn't get to take the meat or the fish. They came loaded with guacamole, said and cheese.
I would probably go there if i was around the area, but wouldn't make a trip though.
