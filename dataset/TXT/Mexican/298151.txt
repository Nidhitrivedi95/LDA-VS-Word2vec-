I have regularly recommended this to anyone looking to find a New Mexican joint. 

I love that they have a salsa bar. Plenty of selections to choose from! 
Also bean dip comes when you sit down (and it's tasty!) 

I've not been disappointed by anything I've ordered thus far. (Tacos Santa Fe and the fajitas are my favorites) 

And the staff is wonderful. Great service to be had here! You won't regret going.
