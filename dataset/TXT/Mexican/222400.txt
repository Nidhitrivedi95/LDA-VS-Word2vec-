RRtjC-KUE9vSbD09r6is2A Salty Seniorita's should write a book on how to have a bar patio filled to the brim at all hours of the day.  I don't think I've ever driven by or gone to Salty's and seen an empty patio.  I definitely think that's a good thing - there's nothing worse than an empty bar.

I've never had the food here (one of the most common things I have to type on Yelp when I'm yelping a bar/restaurant combo establishment.), but the Margaritas aren't bad.  They often times have really good specials ranging from normal like 1/2 off margaritas to a little on the crazy side - think margarita and manicure for twelve bucks.

Salty's is king of the happy hour and if you work in the old town area, it's a great spot to enjoy the cooler evening temperatures on a happenin' patio.  I'd recommend it.
