They offer four types of burritos: pulled pork, chicken, fish and steak, each for $6.99, and loaded with ingredients. When I saw loaded, I mean it's packed like it's about to burst. I do not recommend eating this thing without at least 5 napkins. I used 10 all together. My steak burrito was delicious. 

They also recently put up smokey boneless and skinless BBQ chicken on the menu for $8.99 for a limited time. 

Note: this a takeout place, no seating inside except for two stools by the window. Everything made fresh to order so be prepared to wait about 10 minutes for your order. A LOT of regulars here and I can see why :)
