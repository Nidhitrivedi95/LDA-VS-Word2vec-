FI-8LPGkc8D_hwx0l0zyyg Blanco use to be one of my fav spots. I started going to the one at Biltmore often then switched to the Scottsdale location when I moved. Lately the service has been bad and food has joined. I'm not sure what has happened but the last time I was in the Scottsdale location it smelled like dog poop, the bartender chicks had bad attitudes and service was bad and food was less than mediocre. I gave them a 3 because they use to be solid but today Blanco deserves a 2. I hope they pull it together or it will be off my list. The short rib tacos are the fav when done right...
