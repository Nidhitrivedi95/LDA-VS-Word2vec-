-xSlD0TO9FA-q4VpTirWUQ Delicious Cuban/Mexican fusion with a neighborhood bar feel. I recommend the Cuban sandwich. The bread was soft and flaky, meat was flavorful, and who doesn't love pickles. Must try either the yuca fries or fried plantains with the garlic oil. Hubby had the Ropa Vieja, which is a tangy pot roast over rice with tomatoes and onion. He loved it!
