3-aEgS7X2jrbxA7sA1nARw I've been here a couple of times before and Ive never had a good experience but I tried to always support this local business specially being part of the mexican or Hispanic community, after making a negative review on FB I decided to give sad but true bad experience about this place, one of the people who works there took my review as the worst thing ever and not only mine but all negative reviews were responded as a f..off, by some guy name Gabriel, this place lacks almost of everything, first, service obviously with a manager/owner or else like Gabriel you can only expect employees just like him, no motivation, no passion no nothing, therefore bad service, the place is very small so it gets very crowded at some events,while some people complained about that, again this guy Gabriel received  it as an offense telling people "if you don't like it, then leave!" It's just funny to see no intention to satisfy any request or complain from this place, they offer a service they don't even know how to serve!!, I mean it's really sad to find places like this representing not only Hispanic community but a state and a industry as food, I only can not recommend this place. Thankfully there are other places willing to treat me right as a person, customer and make business.Thank you.
