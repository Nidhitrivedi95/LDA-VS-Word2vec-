JMwwxARF34aR1aq7hzpiJQ Stumbled onto this place one day driving by and piqued my curiousity. I do love pupusas but it's been years since and the BF never had one. 

We started off with some of their horchata which is Salvadorean style. That style is not milky cinnamon but had much more of a strong cinnamon, nutmeg and chocolate flavor to it. Liked it, but it was perhaps a bit too strongly flavored for me. 

We got two pupusas - bean& cheese and the revueltas (mixed). Theirs was good and served piping hot. Curtido was nice and the chilled slaw with a hot pupusa was a really nice temperature and flavor contrast. I prefered the mixed one as that is what I'm used to eating in LA, the BF preferred the bean&cheese one. 

BF ordered to share a garlic shrimp plate. The shrimp was fresh, cooked right and the seasoning was decent. It came with white rice, beans that were more liquidy/pasty, salad, tortillas (basically unfilled pupusas). 

Service was decent enough. 

I think I would come back here for the pupusas for sure. They're cheap, filling, and done really well here. Definitely, their namesake is solid.
