XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg We tried to walk-in for dinner and were told the first opening they had was 3 hours later, so we came back (with a reservation) a couple of nights later.  We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share- lobster tacos (they had a kick), romaine salad (amazing croutons ), chicken skewers (that our waiter showed us how to make into delicious tacos), and the whole reason I wanted to come to Mesa: the tiger shrimp tamale.  The tamale is one of the best (if not THE best) things I have ever eaten.  I will be coming back to Mesa every time I'm in Vegas just to eat that dish.
