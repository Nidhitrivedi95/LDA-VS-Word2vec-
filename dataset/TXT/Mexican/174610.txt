MmU8ak-uG-s1RbqXu13m0Q I was fairly shocked seeing this rating! I went last Thursday for dinner around 8pm while on a business trip and it was packed! My co-worker was on a mission to take me here and I understand why. It is a very American/student friendly type place with regular specials.

The portions themselves are gigantic. I'm a fairly big eater and could only finish half my plate.

The salsa was the best part of the dinner! It tasted great with chunks of tomato and cilantro. It definitely had some kick to it!

Now my main point of contention that made my review a 3 not 4 are the drinks and service. My Co-worker ordered a strawberry margarita which was actually a lime margarita with strawberry syrup coating the bottom. Even after she mixed it together it still tasted like margarita. I ordered the lychee sangria which was fantastic and actually came with two fresh lychees. It tasted great and I've never seen it offered anywhere before! My main issue was 1. Ice- the mason jar I had was filled with Ice to the top. 2. the price- I read on the menu that a glass of sangria was in the 6$ range and when I got my bill it said 12$ which was shocking. When taking it up with my waitress she merely shrugged at me. Which brings me to my next point- the terrible service. Its basically non existent and takes a while to track anyone down to take your order.

All in all I'd return for the food but be more weary of the drinks.
