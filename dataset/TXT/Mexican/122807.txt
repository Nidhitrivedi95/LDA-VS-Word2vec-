hgo0jDweUcHMHqNDnQQm9A Been here a few times, Had a few things and over all I am very happy with the food quality. This particular time I enjoyed a dinner combo that consisted of a red cheese enchilada, and shredded beef taco, and a green chili burrito. The enchiladas red sauce was very dark and very tasty, the taco was as good as a taco can be and I liked the green chili burrito however I would have rather had green chili pork instead of green chili beef.....Overall great experiance and good food.
