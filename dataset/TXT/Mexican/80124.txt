cwsxAGssF-DBU-Gj9_yg9Q I have been to Tachido's about 6 times. The mole torta is super delicious, all the sandwiches are pretty delicious, their black bean soup is fantastic and the tacos are a small but reasonably priced snack. I especially like their special where you can tack-on a soup or salad and a juice-of-the-day to your bill for a good price. Although I once got dismissed by the owner for sending back a flat beer, the service has otherwise been great.
