JIfSollg32ifUzTw2K4PDQ What a nice little gem hidden on the old Las Vegas strip. I passed by this place twice and missed it both times, but finally saw it when I stood across the way to take a picture. This place is a small little hole in the wall, but it offers a big menu. They have everything from tacos, to tortas, to burritos and quesadillas. This is as authentic as it gets in Vegas. I could definitely compare to the delicious Mexican food we have back home in California. I ordered the tacos and they were so delicious I over ate. The staff is also very friendly and quick to wipe down their bar counter where people eat, to ensure its always clean for the next person. Will definitely be back.
