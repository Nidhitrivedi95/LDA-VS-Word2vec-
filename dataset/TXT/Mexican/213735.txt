Then, on my last visit -after hyping this place up to out-of-town relatives - service was so slow and inattentive. I was so annoyed. Perhaps it was because of understaffing? The food was decent. Looking at other reviews, it would seem El Carnicero would benefit greatly from focusing on improving service. The food on my half dozen or so visits has ranged from fair to really good. For the prices, service should really be much better.
