Iexe2eXRLZLCj6v5tCMiDg Sometimes, between two meetings, you need something quick for the lunch time. Of course, this is a Mexican fast food so I was not expecting to have the most astonish meat ever, but I was expecting a bit more.

Situated in the Montreal Eaton Centre, Taco Supreme is part of the food area of the shopping center. The food was OK, but they put it in the microwave before giving it to me. This is the last things I'm expecting from a restaurant when I'm paying for food: using the microwave to warm my food. Just for this, it's a no-go for me. At least the service was friendly.
