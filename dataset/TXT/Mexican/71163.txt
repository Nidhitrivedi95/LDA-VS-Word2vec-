C2BR0TjNacoNzItPLUHTAA Everything I've had here has been excellent. I usually get the fish taco mountain for myself, and whatever my friends want. I've had the blackened ono ahi sandwich, which is excellent and very meaty. I love fish, but even if you're not a huge fan of fish, just give it a chance. I would say it's the closest to a steak sandwich made of fish you can get.
The coconut shrimp is very good, but in my opinion, a bit pricy. The calamari is some of the most tender I've had, though.
I usually get take-out, as I live and work close. When they say it will be ready in ten minutes, they actually mean it.
My name is Stirling Peters.
