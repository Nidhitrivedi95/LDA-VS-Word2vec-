frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A I'm sure you have heard my stories how I have had to drag my son to try some places in the valley, well my son had been very annoying telling me I need to go with him to La Santisima, he just loves that's close to his house. 

It was 9:30am on a Saturday and I was in the mood for breakfast and told him ok let's go! He had already warned me that it was a small place with a long a wait but that they were worth wait. We walked in and saw we were the only ones theirs, YES! No wait for us!

I was in the mood for a breakfast burrito, but after checking out there breakfast menu I went the Chilaquiles Rojos with Chicken, toasted tortilla with salsa roja, chicken, cheese topped off with over easy eggs & with black beans severed with bread & avocado.  Oh my gawd, this was an excellent breakfast! It was a lot of food, I couldn't finish it all, it was flavorful, and it was the perfect amount of sauce to tortilla, so good!

I am glad my son talked me into trying them out, now I have to go back for some Tacos!
