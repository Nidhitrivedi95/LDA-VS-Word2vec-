gDOuHjntsN37XEjROoQ2Aw I love how fresh their seafood is. Huge fan of their governor, which is their shrimp quesadilla. I usually get a head ache from certain batters restaurants use, mainly due to the msg, but theirs is super delicious, and not very oily. They could work on their spend a little, but overall a very wonderful place to eat.
