uQdk6xm0TE4qji48yysRDA We walked in it was ok not to busy,  not dead.  We sat down and we placed our order.  It took 25 mins to get apps,  we ordered crab cakes, but there was barely any crabs.  Than another 20 mins for mains, and those were ok. My friend ordered Baja fish tacos- the fish was to big for the tacos,  I decided on the chimichanga and it was filled with more rice.  Based on service this place is disappointing.  There were 8 employees so I'm not sure what happened.  Good was just ok,  nothing special to rave about. No chance of me coming back.
