hTSIT3puu8m8-kOZYS4Zdg Where do I even begin? How can one even begin to write a review to properly articulate how incredible, flavorful, and goddamn sexy Ohio City Burrito is? 

I've been here a few times and I have yet to be let down. 

Service is fast and friendly. Your order is made in front of you like at a Chipotle. There are various vegetarian () and omnivore options. Get the steak. Just get it. It's spicy, tender, flavorful, and delicious. There are a ton of salsa options and multiple tasty add ons. 

Chips and salsa are always great, and the guac packs a punch. 

Highly recommend if you're in Ohio City and want to devour something simply perfect.
