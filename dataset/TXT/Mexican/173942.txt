Nothing fancy and could almost be called a hole in the wall but well worth the trip.  I really can't come up with all the expletives that fully address how good I think their food is.  I am telling you...I am begging you...please go there and spread the good word.
I had heard of this place through a couple of newspaper articles and was determined to get there.  My wife, who has spent time in Mexico and knows authentic Mexican food, were like children at Christmas trying to eat them in the front seat of my van. As good as the tacos were, the sauces they included and a ball of cilantro and onions wrapped in aluminum foil, were killer.
This was one of the few times in my life that the taste, quality and price exceeded my expectations by miles. 
Whoever runs this place...please don't screw it up with any changes...you have done everything right.
