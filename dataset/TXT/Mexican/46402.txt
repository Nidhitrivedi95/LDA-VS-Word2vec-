7QThNKBZfCNDsCaWRoejMw Let me start off by saying this place is like a chipotle in almost every way. Except food quality. The food is fresh, authentic and flavourful. The rice has no flavour whatsoever in my opinion (needs a new recipe). The sauces are awesome from the pico de gallo to the mango habanero and great authentic iced tea. Decor in the place is hip and fun. But everything is negative from there. Service is not consistent. Some of the employees have a bad attitude. As well, the only 2 sauce allowed is absolutely ridiculous for the price of the food! I really don't get it. Finally, those portion controlled utensils they use belong in a cafeteria not a restaurant. If management changed those things id have no problem giving a 5-star. If you need the chipotle fix, this place is as close as it gets in the 514.
