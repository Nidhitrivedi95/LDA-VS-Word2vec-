I9lZ1zjPLiCYSfRIwfFupQ Coworkers and I had lunch at the Exchange Tower. Been here before. I usually order a grilled steak salad bowl but this time I ordered the pork carnitas burrito with some nachos, salsa and pico on the side. The pork was well seasoned and very flavorful. Lots of toppings to choose from. The nachos are fried on site, pico was fresh and spicy. Lots of fresh ingredients. Try it! It's delicious!
