VEeqUTODkjwera_JKy97rg Decent. They have vegan options including tofu and beans. They didn't have them marked as vegan but they were willing to look at the ingredients for everything to make sure it was and they even assured me that they cook it separate from animal-derived ingredients. All-in-all a great experience employee-wise.

The food was good, not great, but good. The prices, not too bad, and they will deliver to my house, which is always a plus. I will have to try their tacos soon.
