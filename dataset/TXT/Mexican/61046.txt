arpBUwgiaE8iqfNGMQ_hgg I used to loooove this place, but my last two experiences were underwhelming. The burrito fillings are not very interesting, and both the burritos we ordered were lukewarm. Service was extremely indifferent. 

Good if you're in a hurry and want something filling! I was full for the rest of the day.
