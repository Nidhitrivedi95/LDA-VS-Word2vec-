fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg Delicious!! The place was awesome, the decor was wonderful and the food tasted so good. The wait staff knows what gluten sensitivity means; she even asked if I was sensitive or had full blown celiac, which was quite impressive! The fish tacos are delicious and not breaded. You do pay for chips and salsa, but you get a good amount of chips and the salsa is very good. Wonderful place!
