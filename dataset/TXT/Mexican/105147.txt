FI-8LPGkc8D_hwx0l0zyyg We visited Blanco Scottsdale for the first time and came away impressed.

Blanco's is one of the Fox Restaurant Group places, and it is a nice concept in upscale gourmet Mexican food. http://www.foxrc.com/

The Chicken Fajitas were flavorful at $15.00, as were the Machaca Tacos for $12.00 and BBQ Pork Tacos for $11.00 (See photos). The Ground Beef Nachos ($12.00, plus $6.00 for a side of Guacamole) went pretty quickly. 

Our lunch bill for a party of four came to $68.53 before tip and everything was very good, though admittedly some of the portions were small.
