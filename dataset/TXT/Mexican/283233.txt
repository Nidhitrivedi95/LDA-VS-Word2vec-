XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg I've watched Bobby Flay on television for a long time and have been on the fence about him and his food.  However, given his successes I've wanted to give his food a chance.

The brunch menu at Mesa Grill was a bit limited.  I ordered the Scrambled Eggs Chilaquiles with roasted tomatillo sauce, white cheddar cheese, and creme fraiche.  The scrambled eggs were fluffy and not overcooked.  The tomatillo sauce had a nice background heat that didn't overpower the sauce.  The eggs sat atop blue corn tortillas that surprisingly maintained their texture and didn't disintegrate while cutting.  

The presentation and flavor were just good; nothing extraordinary.  The portion was a little on the smallish side.  

I recommend you try their partida margarita (which was notable), but go elswhere for food.
