fYTfTGqseS7rJk9AMt2zvw The food is alright. It's not bad but it's not amazing either. Large portions at reasonable prices. I do have to say the guacamole was very good. The biggest thing I liked about this place was the service. I was pleasantly surprised because they were really busy. We got everything on time and our drinks stayed filled.
