mz1zD5_eqyCQNuzAqB_iKg I would love to come back and try more of their vegan fare but based on my first visit, it wasn't all too impressive.  I'm so glad there is an authentic Mexican place that offers vegan anything so three enthusiastic stars for that alone!  My boyfriend did really enjoy their vegan burrito, too.  The vegan avocado taco was TINY, and really didn't compare to Garden Grill's beer battered avocado soft tacos.
