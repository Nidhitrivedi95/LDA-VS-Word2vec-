C2BR0TjNacoNzItPLUHTAA A friend recommended this new restaurant so my husband, son & I stopped in for dinner.  This restaurant is AMAZING! Huge portions, fresh ingredients, super clean and a very friendly staff.  The entire interior has a great beachy vibe that reminds you of Maui (where their original location is).  We have been back many times!!
I recommend the fish taco's, my husband loved the "Taco Mountain" and my little toddler chowed down on the fish & brown rice!
