XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Went here a couple of weeks ago. Wasn't impressed. The "signature margarita" was nothing special, I can make better margaritas. I had the tuna steak. Again, it was nothing special. In fact, there are better tuna steaks in the frozen isle of Trader Joe's. 

And of course because it's Bobby Flay's place, the price was outrageous. Maybe it would've been worth it if the place had lived up to its high profile, pretentious, reputation.
