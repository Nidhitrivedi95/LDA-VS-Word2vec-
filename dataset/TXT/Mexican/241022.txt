TcCWYYL6FxBTT6KrxabwRg Tacos are not usually a huge hit with me when I go to a Mexican restaurant - I like them, but they are usually not exceptional. The tacos made out on the street outside of Reyna Foods in the Strip - awesome, and definitely the best tacos I have had anywhere. The ingredients are all great, but the grilled flavor of the tortilla and the fresh ingredients, included the freshly squeezed lime juice, complete everything and make every bite wonderful. The beef tongue and fish tacos were fantastic. Also, if you like some heat, try their homemade sauces in the big plastic jars at the end of the line. Now this is street food, baby!
