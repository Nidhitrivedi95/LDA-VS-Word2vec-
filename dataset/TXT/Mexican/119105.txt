GrwvBAEALujIOPQeOfN1vA The only reason the review gets two stars is because my meal was good. The service was horrible, and the other two meals were subpar. It took us over ten minutes to be acknowledged at our table. Eventually a manager came to us and got drink orders but never apologized for the wait. There were many tables open, I understand busy nights but this did not appear to be the ordeal. Eventually a waitress got our order, one meal was over cooked and dry, the other came out cold and a side of cold fundido sauce that they said they microwaved.
