We showed up the last 20 minutes of happy hour , not only did the amazing waitress get us our good but when happy hour was about to end she made sure she we had enough drinks, even though we still had our first ones she got us two more still at happy hour price. The manager was as sweet as our waitress. We went back the next day for dinner. I recommend you go out of your way to go there.
