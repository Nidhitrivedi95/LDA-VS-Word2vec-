tXqaK0lBEE1XJbzDPsdFvg I love farmer boys! This place is my "quick stop" meal anytime anywhere. Farmer's burger on sourdough with extra avocados please!  My kids love this place. You get what you want in a reasonable time. 
Perfect if you want to pick up food on the way to football practice. 
Nothing fancy but I would definitely choose Farmer Boys over any other fast food chain.
Food is freshly made. Who doesn't want fresh food? I could get a decent salad at a reasonable price. They need to be open 24/7 though. Come on, it's Vegas!
