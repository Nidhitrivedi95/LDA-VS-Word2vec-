SEjyjYlMfFFzkHaru6JadA Went there last night for dinner with 2 of my friends. They seated us right away, got our drinks, gave us menus and brought chips and 3 different dips right away. We all ordered 3 different items plus an appetizer. Our server was amazing and the food was delicious. The server was told it was my friend and I's belated birthday dinner celebration and brought us 2 flan desserts on the house. Also delicious. Exceptional service and would definitely come back. Thank you!
