mES9E5K4HbYoPFXGv0pUuw Whoa. I've had me some Mexican in Toronto, but Como En Casa which moved in May 2012, has now topped the charts.

Had the amazing Abodo chicken, and got guac on the side -- definitely the best guac I've had.

Everything is 100% fresh, tasty, cheap, healthy.

The owner/chef came & talked to us while we were eating and was a really nice dude-- lots of pride in his meals. Highly recommended.
