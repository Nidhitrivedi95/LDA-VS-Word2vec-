DYnFGGYU3SkrKT_G4djpYQ Came with a large group. There were only 2 people working. The wait was incredibly long. The people before our group demanded to have their money back. They made a huge fuss. We just went with be flow. For the price of what you get, the food was just okay. Skip this place. Any other Tex Mex would suffice. I will say that the staff were very kind and understanding, despite their own frustrations.
