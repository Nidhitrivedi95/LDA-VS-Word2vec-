L2iT7pipc455Tgpbo35_mw I have been here a few times for drinks, but was worried about coming here to eat after reading some of the reviews.

A co-worker told me it was good so I decided to give their Taco Wednesday a try. I had the Chronic Taco and the Fried Chicken/Mac and Cheese Taco. The chronic was just average, but the other taco was great! The chipotle sauce was surprising spicy and the chicken was very moist.

The waitress was very nice and gave us free chips even though we didn't order drinks. The food came out pretty quickly too.

Overall a solid and filling lunch for $10.
