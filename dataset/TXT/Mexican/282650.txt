XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg I had always walked by Mesa at Caesar's Palace wanting to give it a try.  We made a dinner reservation and I finally had my chance to try it.  Its a Bobby Flay Tex Mex restaurant located in Caesars Palace across from the sports book.  It's a fancy kind of place where you have multiple waiters assigned to different tasks.

We get sat at our table and the waiter takes our drink orders.  He sells me on the Patrida margarita, a margarita mixed with organic agave.  It was served in martini glass neat.  It was excellent.  The hidden agave flavor was subtle but made the drink.

The waiter brought us over a little basket of bread.  It had a couple of these little cornmeal muffins that were delicious.  Couple slices of Parmesan infused bread and some other fresh baked breads.

For our appetizer, we ordered the goat cheese fundido.  It came in a small cast iron serving dish with a bed of blue corn tortilla chips.  It was a nice mix of cheeses with a crunchy/chewy crust in the corners.  A nice little appetizer.

For my main course, I ordered the 22 ounce ribeye medium rare with a side of brussel sprouts.    The steak was cooked perfectly, very tender, and had a delicious almost sweet crust.  It came with a green and a red sauce to compliment the steak.  I enjoyed the green and opted for an extra portion.  The brussel sprouts were decent.

Overall, a nice fine dining experience.  A little pricey but worth it.
