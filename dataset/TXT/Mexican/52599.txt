9jdlzH0HjU9_Fi3D-_a6gA We love this place we come here at least once or twice a month! We always are greeted with a smile and we like to sit in the bar area because it's more (cozy). Our waiter is usually Bruno, we love Bruno he is nothing but nice and is always there when we need him. Good food! Good service! And a great time with family!
