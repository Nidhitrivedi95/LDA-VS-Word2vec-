Our waitress was stressed out before we got there. If you don't enjoy your job, don't take it out on the people who you expect to give you a tip.  Every time we asked for another drink (she never proactively asked if we wanted more) she looked so put out we thought she might spit in it.

The food was really bland. The chili con queso was as thick as liquid Elmer's glue. The taste was ok. The chips were way over salted. The carnitas tasted to be boiled and unspiced/unseasoned. The rice was definitely NOT Spanish rice. It didn't taste bad, it just wasn't what it was described to be. The nachos didn't have but a few shreds of browned cheese & the jalapeños appeared to be added post cooking. The steak was well done when asked for medium. We were also told certain things were not on the menu or offered this day (Indians opening day) because they didn't want to use their glassware?!!!! All drinks were served in cheap plastic cups.

Please please pass this place up. Go elsewhere.  I made the mistake of not checking yelp reviews first... Bad mistake!

I was in town for business... 

Go somewhere else!
