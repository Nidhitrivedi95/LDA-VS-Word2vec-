82g1PwX5FvclqqdjJHcVNA Bomb tacos are the bomb!  .

The guy at the counter (could have been the owner/chef) was happy to accommodate a vegetarian diet and recommended subbing a potato/herb mixture instead of meat... he also had a pototo/vege chorizo mixture.  The tacos he recommended were perfect with crispy fried shells, made in house and topped with tomatoes, lettuce, onions, queso fresco and a sour cream sauce.  The guy at the counter brought out two habanero salsas to try (one fresh habanero and one roasted) which were amazing. 

We also had the rice and beans. The rice was really good but different than any Mexican rice I've had. It was made with white rice and was cooked with celery.  We really enjoyed it.

My husband had the Carne Asada, Grilled Chicken, and Crispy Chicken tacos and loved all of them but liked the Carne Asada so much he went back and ordered 2 more. 

The guy at the counter had a true passion for his food and said he's experimenting with making and casing his own chorizo in house to improve the flavor and consistency of it. 

This place lives up to it's name. We will be returning very soon and often!  Try it out!
