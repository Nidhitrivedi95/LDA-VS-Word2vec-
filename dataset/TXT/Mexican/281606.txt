Loved the banana custard, I'm not a big fan of banana desserts but this made me a convert! Service was impeccable and super fast. Had thee best waitress Athens (spelling?) we ended up having an hourlong convo with her as the restaurant closed, gave us amazing recommendation for more eats around town and some eye opening philosophies were shared such an amazing person! Best part of the meal! Thanks Athena!!
