8ou6p7T-3KaNOhDeln3Ccg Was excited about this place because I love tacos, but ended up leaving slightly disappointed.  Appreciate another fast casual option for this type of food.  This place has tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and taco salads so I like having more choices.  I was looking forward to the salsa bar, but in the end, I only liked one of the corn salsas.  I ended up ordering a taco salad which was pretty good, just not amazing.  The queso was alright.  You get your money's worth with the portion sizes.  It's worth going to if you want to try a new fast casual place. I'm sure kids really like the salsa bar.  I would go here over Chipotle, and it's not a bad place to have a quick lunch. But I'm not in a rush to go back.
