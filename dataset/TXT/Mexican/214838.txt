QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA Food is really good. I've had pretty much all of the nachos on the menu (huge nacho fan) and I haven't been disappointed. The staff is hit or miss. There have been times people will sit down 10 minutes after we do, and get their food a good 10 - 15 minutes before ours. (Yes, I've waitressed, I know it can be that some food is made more quickly. However. This has happened multiple times, one of which the other table ordered the same thing we did.)

If you request alterations (add sour cream, no beans, whatever) make sure you repeat it a few times. The food is good when it's right, but often is rushed and not made how you've asked. All around, I'll definitely be back, but dining in has been a bit frustrating.
