s36Rk0jd78z75LaqifnU3Q Fantastic authentic Mexican food. Not American food with a Mexican flair as I've heard other establishments claim. The lunch menu is extensive quick and inexpensive. Dinner is varied, and delish. Not the made up Spanish sounding names that the big chains give to pseudo Mexican food, but real stuff. This would not be exceptional in California or Texas, but for the Pittsburgh area it is mind blowing.
