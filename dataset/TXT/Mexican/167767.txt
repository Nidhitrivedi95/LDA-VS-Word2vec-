LtO6vTBfYzlgWArn3kRe_A Tacos El Gordo hits the spot again! The fam and I had the midnight munchies for authentic Mexican street tacos and were excited we made it just before closing at 2:00am. 

I prefer this location because there are two spacious dining areas and works well if you're dining with a large party.

To order, you must wait in the appropriate line for beef, pork, or "other" proteins such as cabeza or lengua (beef tongue). My fam's favorite is the adobada (spicy pineapple pork) and Asada (beef). All tacos are served in freshly made corn tortillas, but you can also request flour. I also love their white cheese quesadillas in a flour tortilla. So soft, fluffy, and delicious! The tortillas here are just on point.

They also serve fries, so you can order them with any meat toppings such as Carne Asada Fries - my son's favorite.

Be sure to request all the fixin's for your tacos such as pico de gallo and guacamole. If you like grilled green onions and peppers, you can request that too as a complimentary plate.

Red or green salsa's are available behind the register, so make sure you request a few from the cashier.

Having to stand in multiple lines for various proteins is a bit of a bummer. But that's just the way TEG operates, so understand this going in. Your wait time could be a little longer than if you were at taco shop like Roberto's, so plan accordingly. It's totally worth the wait though!
