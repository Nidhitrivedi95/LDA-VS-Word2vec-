Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ Truly disappointing! Unfortunately we weren't impressed. Overpriced, mediocre food. $10 spinach enchiladas at our hometown Mexican restaurant blow theirs away. Rice and beans were bland and the skirt steak really had little flavor. $6 jumbo margaritas at our local Mexican restaurant are larger and far better. The only thing we really enjoyed were the chips and salsa. Service was good!
