WLblFINiPI18_o1OdDsnVg I love comin to cafe rio. Their portions are huge and I usually get the chicken tostada. 

You could literally get anything from their menu and share with someone. I absolutely LOVE their tortilla here. They make them in house and they are always fresh. 

I always order it on the side and I recommend you get it on the side when you order the salad (cause it comes with a tortilla below all the lettuce and it tends to get soggy)
