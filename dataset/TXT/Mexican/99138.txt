eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg So I was toying with 3 or 4 stars.  And as you can see,  I settled with four stars because I know I will be back.

So we have eyed this place for YEARS.  It has been booked marked for me since I have started yelp.  And one Sunday evening we finally decided to give it a try.

It starts off with a 45 minute wait, which I expected, but luckily we only had to wait 10 minutes.  I am glad they prepared to expect the worse, so as I braced myself for a long wait it felt like a gift when in 10 minutes we were seated and perusing the menu.

We had to try the guacamole.  You get to chose what goes in it, and the server recommended everything, which means everything you expect in a guac with something you don't expect: pomegranate seeds.  It was expensive, but fresh and very good.

Now the reason why I toyed with 3 stars.  My entree.  I had the carne tacos and hubby had the Cochinita Pibil.  I honestly though they were just okay.  Hubby RAVED about his slow roasted pork.  I found it tender, but not tasty.  My carne tacos were good enough, but for the price and all the hype I guess I had expected to be wowed more.

Service was good.

So back to toying with the stars again. Expensive Mexican food, but it was kinda worth it....  See I am trying to figure that one out.  So I need to come back and try another dish. I do think this place is more than just the 3 star definition of A-OK.  For me, it is more like 3 1/2 stars. I decided to round up to four stars, because I will be back. Also my hubby enjoyed it so much, and that makes me happy.  But this was the most reluctant four stars I have yet to hand out.
