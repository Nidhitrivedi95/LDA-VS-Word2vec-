hifhQ-zx4g3JMoP8CxtDwg I was craving a burrito for lunch and I remember a friend recommending this place. It was close to home, and I was up for trying some place new besides going to Mucho Burrito which is my fav! 

Atmosphere: quiet & spacious
Cleanliness: tables didn't appear to be clean. I seen a long brown hair on my table before sitting. 
Constructive criticism: there should be a cutlery station for all utensils needed. Ie, fork, spoon, knife, salt, pepper, napkins, straws etc. Would like to see real dinner napkins and not a rough paper towel. It would be appealing for the customer and also be beneficial to the owner if the burrito toppings were visible behind a glass shield. I had to ask which kinds of beans were offered (black or brown). No pulled pork on the menu. It was like he was trying to hide the preparation. I tried to look over the counter to see what was available for toppings besides the offering of "Would you like everything on it"? The place had no music. It was silent (awkward much). 
Cuisine: Mexican.
Facilities: I didn't go.
Food: I ordered the chicken burrito on a whole wheat wrap. Topped with brown bean spread, rice, lettuce, tomato, cheese, hot sauce, salsa, guacamole and sour cream. It was flavourful. (Onions and jalapeños were offered but not chosen). 
Likeliness of returning or recommending to others: I would return here again because I like the fact that the guacamole wasn't an extra charge like most places, but I much rather go to Mucho Burrito where I can see my choices. 
Parking: private. 
Portion Sizes: large. I was full! 
Price: fair. $11 with a bottle of water. I believe my burrito was the large size.
Service: the Owner seemed friendly and made casual conversation. He didn't offer a choice for what size burrito. I heard the next customer after me request for a small. Had I known...
Selection: good selection. I wish there was pulled pork on the menu though!
