Auky7_gMsUdB91V0EAgbhA To quote my husband, "Best. Shrimp Enchiladas. Ever."  

The food was amazing, but best of all was the service.  Pam really knows how to do it right.  Everyone was really great and went over the top to make sure we had a fantastic experience.  The atmosphere is romantic and cozy, but there was still enough room for them to serve a table of 12 without batting an eye.  

Thank you to everyone at Mejico that made our experience so terrific, would recommend them to anyone!
