ICdr0vjfpQj4IRNK9D22sQ First time here!  Very friendly and helpful staff.  The menu is unique and has several exclusive choices that are reasonably priced across the board.  Salsa is great.  3 bites into it and had to write this review because it is extremely flavorful!  I wish there was a location near me in Akron...
