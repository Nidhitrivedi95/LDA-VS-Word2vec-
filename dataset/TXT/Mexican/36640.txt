I knew what I was going to order as soon as I walked in.... Leñero Hambreado.  I love to cook, but I can't come close to duplicating this at home.  The lamb is so juicy, and has perfect heat.

We met the owner this time, he took me outside to show me the patio and let me know that they are having live music later.  Very friendly with my family, and my little son.  

Food was exactly as I expected.  Even the kids meal was great.... chicken/bean/rice bowl.  I miss that they don't have their Bell Road location, but it was absolutely worth the drive to Scottsdale.

Looking forward to next time!
