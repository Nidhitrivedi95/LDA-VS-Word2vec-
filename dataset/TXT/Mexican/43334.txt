7GGJlp1aWfcXGQz6q7SkXQ I had a good time. I wasn't really sure what to expect from this self professed dive bar, but I had a really good time. The staff was good and super friendly, mostly. 

The $50 all you can drink wristband was what drew us in. It is valid all day and you don't have to sit there, you can come and go as you please. I didn't want to have to wear high heels and dress, though I did wear a skirt. There is no real dress code or 1000 people line up to get in. All of this appeals to me. I just want to have fun now and not wait in line for hours. The only downside I saw to the $50 wristband is that you can't get doubles, has to be mixed, and they don't really seem to be in a rush to serve you. There were a couple bartenders that were great. A couple that completely ignored me. That almost killed the night!

The pool table was a little lopsided, maybe even lumpy. I am not that bad at pool, but I did have a few drinks in me. The mechanical bull was fun to watch, couldn't quite drink up enough courage to give it a shot. 

They usually have to move tables to get a dance floor going, but there wasn't a lot of people when we were there so they didn't bother. There was a menu as well, but I didn't partake. From the looks of the food coming out, it was on par with any standard pub. I really liked the location, the type of venue, and just the general atmosphere. I will definitely be back.
