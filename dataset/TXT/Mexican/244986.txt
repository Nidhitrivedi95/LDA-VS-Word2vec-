I ordered vegetarian fajitas and a raspberry margarita - both were VERY tasty! My date wished he had ordered fajitas too when the waitress brought the sizzling cast iron skillet to our table! Fresh, delicious bell peppers, zucchini, yellow squash, mushrooms and cauliflower with corn tortillas. 

The portions were incredibly generous here. I ate until I was stuffed and still had enough leftovers for another full meal at home the next day. The raspberry margarita was really sweet and a little strong, but still tasty. Our waitress was great - and we had very fast service.

I've only been here once but will definitely return!
