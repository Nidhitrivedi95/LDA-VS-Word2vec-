G6BwYw_0_atLPTzI1uokIA Can I give zero stars?  We walked in and were seated in a section with no other patrons.  No one came to take our order however 3 waiters were pointing at us arguing who was going to take the table.  When I asked after 15 minutes why we were not even helped yet the hostess stated she would have someone right over.  No one ever came.  I asked to speak to the manager who happened to be one of the three people pointing at us.  He wanted to 'make it right' but it was too late.  If you are a family (2 kids under 7) be warned- do not patron this location.  They will not help you!
