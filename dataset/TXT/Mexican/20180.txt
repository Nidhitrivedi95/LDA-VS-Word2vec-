My wife got the carne asada fries while I got the three taco combo (carne asada and carnitas). These were some of the best tacos I have eaten. Ever. 
We highly recommend this place, as they are fighting the good fight against "fakes-ican" food as Pinches puts it. 
Go there for a cheaper and off the beaten path meal.
