-o082vExIs0VVNSuZmiTQA We were very disappointed after the high rating on yelp.  We are Mexican food lovers, but none of the 3 of us enjoyed our meal.  It's unfortunate as it's a great looking funky place and would have been some place to return too.  Unfortunately that won't happen.  The waitress was pleasant and tried to be accommodating to my mother as all of the sauces were much to hot for her, but she needed something a bit more mild.  My husband ordered the mini taco's.  They must have sat under the heat too long as the beef inside  was a hard chunk of something? and the shells were dry and overdone.  They were a very deep golden color.  I ordered the Chimichunga (chicken),  it was 90 % pico inside with less than 3/4 c of bland white meat of chicken.   I opened it up and just ate the chicken. on a positive note...the chips were good.......
