jIzygnVmajEXYmfsBNY_Gw Came in after discovering a flyer on my car advertising that this place guaranteed they have the best burritos in town. How could I pass up that challenge? At lunch time, had a little difficulty finding the place as it is tucked into a shopping center. Came in to find a clean, brightly decorated interior and friendly staff who spoke both English & Spanish. Behind a glass partition is a counter with tons of burrito and taco toppings and dressings that you can choose for your customized order. They have a very large selection- everything from freshly roasted corn, cilantro, pico, fresh chile verde sauce, cheese and some more uncommon findings.  My husband commented "this is REAL Mexican food". The set-up reminded me of a chain Mexican place starting with a "C" and ending in "otle", only with a much better selection. My husband got a pork burrito, I got a carne asada burrito and we also got 3 tacos.  Wow did we over order. I couldn't eat even half of the burrito, let alone a single taco. The price for the amount of food and the quality is amazing- unbeatable in my opinion.  I disagree with Yelps two $$ designation. I'd give it a $. My burrito was the size of a football- I kid you not. It had a good balance of meat to other ingredients. The tortillas were freshly made and the meat in our dishes was high quality and cooked perfectly. In addition to several options for burritos and tacos, you can find desserts like flan and churros. We will have to return for those and split a burrito in order to be hungry enough. I highly recommend you stop by and give this place a try. It will be my go-to spot for tacos & burritos in Sunnyslope. Even surpasses the famous torta place just a few blocks to the south along 7th street......and that is saying something.
