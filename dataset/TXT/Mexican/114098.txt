RE: Seating 
Despite claiming they won't take reservations for parties under 8 people, we called at 7:30 and they were happy to reserve a table @ 8:30pm for 4 people. They weren't super busy which is probably why they were so accommodating 

RE: Food
-skip the salsa tower. It comes with 4 small offerings of different type of salsas, nothing revolutionary or even super enjoyable - not worth it. 
-The guacamole is a must, very fresh and the chips - which are plantains and other root veggie chips - are very filling
-Steak taco was the table favourite - we also tried Chicken and Pork Tacos and empanadas 
-Chicken taco is VERY spicy - which the server did not tell us about and is not mentioned on the menu (beware). 
-skip the $4.50 Churros - they were hot which was nice but again, nothing special and too pricy for the size of the order 

Most Surprised
-the margarita (classic lime) was OK. Ice could have been blended more. A little too tart. Lacked finesse 

Ambiance 
-great. loved the addition of the DJ around 9PM - still not too loud, but good music. Love the underground feel of the place.
