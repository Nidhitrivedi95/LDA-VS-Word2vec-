TEaBolNAkOdRm2gvIYz4OQ Came back again with the same person insisting the place was great. 

I avoided the single flauta meal ($7 for a flauta with beans and rice), and got a #7 (chile relleno, rice, beans, and a flour tortilla) instead. No regrets. 

The food was great this time around, and despite being a really packed night, our waitress tonight was very attentive. She frequently brought refills and more chips and was prompt in clearing plates and bringing the bill. 

Left full and satisfied this time. 

It was probably just a bad combination of bad server and disappointing food last time that led to the poor rating, but I'd definitely recommend the place now.
