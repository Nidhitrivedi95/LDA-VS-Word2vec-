gDOuHjntsN37XEjROoQ2Aw Fish tacos - fast casual - pretty tasty.

I had the 2 taco combo (2 tacos, fries and a small drink).

I got one fish taco, and one 'full' taco (fish, shrimp and cheese-stuffed yellow pepper).  

The fish taco was good - you put your own cabbage/salsa/whatever on it at the salsa bar.

The full taco was better - the cheese-stuffed pepper put it over the top.
The fries were good, but there were waaaaaayyyy too many of them for one person.

I used the Yelp checkin offer of a free large drink, but the combo still came out to $10...seemed a little high for what it was.
