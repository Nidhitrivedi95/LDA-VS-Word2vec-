1Vvxx-9AoINg8TJXOZgEHg If you're staying at Planet Hollywood, are craving some Mexican food, and don't want to spend the big bucks, Yolos is the place to go.

Located at the corner of the casino at Planet Hollywood, Yolos' pink and green lights lure you in to their sleek but simple restaurant. They are a sit down restaurant as well as a bar so feel free to grab dinner there or take a couple of shots before entering Planet Hollywood's nightclub, Prive just a few steps away.

I always order their steak quesadillas that come with an ample amount of sour cream, guacamole, and salsa. While waiting, you are given a basket of crisp chips and their house salsa that is just the right amount of spicy.

They're never super super busy so good attention is always given by the servers. For 2 people, a check could roughly come out to $36-$40 (including tip). Not too shabby for Vegas!
