B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA Oklahoma is not hip enough to have sushi burritos, so I was very excited to try this novelty fusion dish with Sis and our Mimi.

So imagine a Chipotle but with Japanese decor and flair and much more fish in the menu. That's basically what it is like at SoHo Sushi Burrito. You step into line, pick out your burrito, bowl, or salad. Sis and I ordered burritos and Mimi ordered a burrito bowl. 

I had the Lion King, which had salmon and tempura, two of my tried and trues. If you're not into an overwhelming taste of seaweed, I recommend going with the soy wrap. I ordered the seaweed, which is normally fine on a sushi roll but it was a little much on a burrito. That did not detract from my overall experience though. We also tried the taro chips with queso, which were always very good. Mimi loved her burrito bowl as did Sis and her sushi burrito. 

SoHo definitely provided a tasty foray into this fusion food! The fact that it's right off Sahara made it even easier to get to for us, and I'm willing to bet we'll come again.
