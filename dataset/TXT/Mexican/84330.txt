Located just off Desert Inn and Hulapai, you will find this Roberto's next to a couple of other establishments. The menu is like any other of the gazillion Roberto's located in Vegas....I swear it's like they have more locations than McDonalds lol. But in all seriousness of that serious joke, the menu and prices are on par with what you would expect. Prices are great and quantity and quality is excellent.  Restaurant is clean and well spaced out, and the building's exterior stone brick motif gives it an elegant touch.  There is even a drive thru! Definitely a plus for those late night craves if I don't want to go out of my car and want a quick take home meal even tho service is already quick for in store order. Favorites for me as other places would be carne asada fries, California burritos, carnitas just to name a few. Definitely one of the nicer robertos in town.
