7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA Came here for birthday brunch with my hubby. This place is so busy. Thankfully the lineup outside moves pretty fast as we were seated within 20 minutes.

We ordered freshly squeezed grapefruit juice and a honey ginger tea, both of which were great. After perusing the menu and asking the waiter for recommendations, hubby decided on the huevos migas and I ordered the simple eggs Benedict with ham. 

The food was served relatively quickly and everything was tasty and well seasoned. The hollandaise was the right consistency of creaminess and the eggs were perfectly poached. I appreciated the gluten free options (for a small fee). For those who like heat, they have a homemade habanero sauce (also available for purchase).

If you're looking for a great place to have breakfast/brunch with friends or loved ones, I would definitely recommend Lady Marmalade but come early or be prepared to wait!
