q7MorRPzU_J-iekeDKUKgw Reposado is a little but well known Tequila bar on the Ossington strip. I went here on a Friday night, it was busy but still lots of room to stand around. I tried a mango margarita, they are not shy with the booze! 

We sauntered to the back patio and managed to snag enough free chairs for my group. People were stingy giving up their un-used chairs! 'Oh my friend is coming and I need these 5 empty chairs' um ok.

My wonderful elite friends (shout out to Denise and Leslie) and I shared a tasting of tequilas. The blanco was my favourite! 

There was a live jazz band playing. They were pretty good (I'm not really qualified to review a jazz band so lets leave it at that ;). 

I like Reposado. Its a good date place. Or just to hang out with your peeps. We paid $5 cover on Friday, but I heard that is only on weekends (?).
