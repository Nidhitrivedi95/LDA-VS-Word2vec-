mibbKeg4gbD9O58TCjDWgQ Crispy Chicken tacos was a must on Wednesday since they are only $1. A nice quick fix for crunch and they put plenty of meat in each taco. With lettuce and cheese this is a taco fix that you won't want to miss! Their green sauce is a must have along with a fresh bar of red sauce, cucumber, radish and green onion, great additions!
