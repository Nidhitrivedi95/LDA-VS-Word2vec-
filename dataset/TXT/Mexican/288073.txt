Yevhl8bTwdJuu_LWKv-4Fw Went for lunch with a friend. We had the spicy guacamole for an appetizer. It was very fresh and quite delicious. We ordered from the lunch menu and had the chicken and beef soft taco, grits and sweet plantains. The beef taco was okay but the chicken taco was absolutely wonderful. The roasted corn grits is not like any grits I have ever had. I kept telling myself I would only eat a couple of spoonfuls but that didn't work. I would go back just to have the chicken tacos and grits. For dessert we shared the carrot cake. Thought it was delicious and disappointed to hear it would only be on the menu for 5 more days. Our server was Marisol. She as very knowledgeable about the menu and was quite helpful in narrowing our choices.
