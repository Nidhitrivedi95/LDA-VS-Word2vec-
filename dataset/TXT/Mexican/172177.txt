mB_cI1tCrNxxvr2e2myNrQ All I can say is-- YAAAASSSSS! I love Taco Bell. I love late night food. This place hits the spot when you're getting out of the club or even if you just walked down the strip and got a little hungry. They have alcoholic daiquiris on tap and a fairly large menu. Service is super quick so pay attention to the TV when your order gets done! Not too much space to sit downstairs but take a peek upstairs for available seating. Tables are cleaned up pretty quickly so shoutout to the staff for the good service/maintenance. I really don't even know if it was because I was starving after the club or if this place was just that amazing but...check it out! Nothing like some good Taco Bell to spice up the night.
