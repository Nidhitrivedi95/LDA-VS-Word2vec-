Bf2fuqWbHd3L-X69FSMvmg Soooooooooooo good! I'm from California and these are the closest to real LA/San Diego tacos I've had! 

If you're in the area and want an authentic taco spot (with many more options) come here! 5 carne asada tacos (decent sized) for only $8-10, customer service was great (I think I asked for limes like 5x), and the chips with guacamole was SO good!

Do some shopping in Kensington market once you're all stuffed :)
