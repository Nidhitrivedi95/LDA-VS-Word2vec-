S_bG5WWbtNXhhY9Y0GTcSg My boyfriend and I came in on a Saturday around noon. I thought it would be packed with a brunch crowd, but it wasn't. Everyone who wasn't there was missing out, though, because it was delicious, fast, and all around great. I had the chilaquiles and my boyfriend had a benedict special. We both loved our meals. I had a horchata latte and he had a mimosa. The latte was so incredible, and unique. The atmosphere is great. The service was friendly and FAST. We had been putting off trying this place since it opened because it initially had bad reviews. We are so glad we decided to try it. I just wish we hadn't waited so long.
