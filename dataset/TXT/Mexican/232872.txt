spvjNOYeR7sFX6yTgP21og I love Rancho Relaxo. Simply say "I am vegetarian/gluten-free/vegan/allergic to ANYTHING," and they'll be incredibly attentive to your needs.

The food is fantastic. This is my favourite place to eat in all of Toronto. 

It is under new management, and I would encourage all of the unsatisfied former customers to return here.

It's a great place where everybody (meat eaters included) can get something fantastic to eat.
