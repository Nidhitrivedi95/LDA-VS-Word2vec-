gEv1Og5uGDLw9HkbKSGUZw The greetings were pleasant when we arrived. Our coats were hung up and we were seated a table. We were just there for drinks so a table wasn't ideal but we were told that the bar was full. Felt a bit pressured to order food (because we were at a table) but we weren't that hungry so we got some guacamole. It was great! 

The drinks were OK but for $13, I expected more than a "Canadian" shot (i.e. a single one). The margarita was fine but a tad sweet for my taste and I couldn't really taste any tequila at all....at a TEQUILA bar. They could work on their drinks.

Finally, it was dark. Too dark. We couldn't read the menu which was only lit by a tiny candle. On our way out, there was no one at the coat check....so we got our own coats.

The ambiance is otherwise great. The space is semi-underground, cave-style with great salsa tunes toward the end of the night. The server was very friendly. Overall, it definitely caters to the Entertainment district crowd.
