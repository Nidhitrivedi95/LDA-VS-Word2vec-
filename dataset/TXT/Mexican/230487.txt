sH3UsolKjik01u0HlQ9_0Q My brother ordered food to be picked up, i went to the eastfield location thinking it was ordered there and they gave a bad attitude about it not being ordered there.. went to this location and they gave a bad attitude and hung up on my brother when he called to confirm the order was at this location and they hung up on him. Sucks that we were already halfway there otherwise I would've taken that as a hint to not bother. I honestly don't know how they were able to take our order, give us a total of the order,  and not have it or know about it. My brother confirmed the phone number he took the order with and it was for this place... Never ate here and now I never will with how crowded and rude these people were at both places.
