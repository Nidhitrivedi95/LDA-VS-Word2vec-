rbywwnfMjFjJwLQkgpdIEw This place is the bomb. com I love it we at least try to go there once a week for there taco they are so yummy and made with love. Today I tried a tosada in was great and all my food was hot and well prepared. I will say if you do not call ahead of time or make an online order there is a little wait because they make everything fresh, but threw all that it is still worth the wait. I am loyal customer
