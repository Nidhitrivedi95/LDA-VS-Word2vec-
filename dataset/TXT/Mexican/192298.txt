Ok9vikKusbG_Ue9pJf6s3Q La Captial Tacos is such a cute joint located in Montréal's Chinatown and open till 2 am (say whaaa?) I went there on a chilly Friday night and it was pretty busy but we managed to snag seats at the high tables. The Mexican-Chinese fusion aesthetic is one that I can get on board with. Their table set-up is a little ineffective but has a communal vibe which I can get on board with. I had the el pastor which was lovely and the Mexican coke was also very good. We also got the tortilla chips with the bean dip (I don't remember the name - apologies) which I enjoyed! The bill came to about $19 after tip each and the service was impeccable. Do come here if you're looking for good tacos and good service but I will say that the food is not incredibly filling! Ps: their plates are über cute!
