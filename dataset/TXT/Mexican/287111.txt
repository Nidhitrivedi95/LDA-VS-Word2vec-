ybFJUdRaN4eCff-W3HHiEw Ate here a few nights ago and the food was awesome. The summer menu is delicious. Their grilled endive salad, zucchini tacos and the taco of the month made with octopus were all fantastic. We also had their smoked mackerel rillette, a special for the night and it was tasty. Service was attentive and the casual family atmophere was inviting. They always have a great wine list with reasonably priced options, it's a well thought out list. 

Its nice when restaurants change up their menu, it makes it fun for returning customers and for the kitchen, keeps their jobs exciting and keeps it interesting for the customers palate.
