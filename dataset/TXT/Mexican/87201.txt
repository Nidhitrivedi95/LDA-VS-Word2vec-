dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA Haven't had a bad meal yet and I have been more than once... in fact maybe once a week.  Everything from breakfast burritos to flautas... we love the whole menu.  While having an overstuffed burrito isn't for the lite eaters (they have fish tacos, salad and shrimp fajitas for you) the burritos are more than a mouthful.  Easily missed is the nachos, but don't skip them.  They are simple, but loaded and a meal all by themselves.  Everything is made to order and fresh - no fast food here just fast service with a smile.  Frank makes the place welcoming to all who enter and he makes sure you leave full.  I hear he even makes a great burger (the Ph. D burger)... I am sure I will have one soon.  You don't have to count your pennies to eat here either... probably the most affordable place in town and you will always get more than your monies worth.

Go for breakfast... where else can you get a 15 cent cup of coffee with 2 refills now a days and he opens the doors at 4am for you early risers or late night workers - now I just need to convince him to open on Sundays!
