Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ Food is absolutely delicious. Service horrible. Our server totally forgot about us. And when he finally heard we were unhappy he came to our table as we were about to leave. His excuse was he got busy. He could have sent us another server. Anyhow, i hope the manager takes the time to train them more.
