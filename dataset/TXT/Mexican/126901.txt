hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg We came here for the poutine, which I'd seen on the Today Show. It's got lobster chunks in it, so I had to try it. Eh. It was okay. The poutine here was by far the tiniest poutine in Montreal and it cost $19. Other poutines we had were twice as big and half the price. Unless you're like me and have to try it for yourself, skip the poutine.

We also had the jerk crab as an appetizer. THIS was something to freak out about. The jerk seasoning was amazing; spicy and flavorful. I just can't explain it. It was so good.

For entrees, I had the scallops and my husband had the pork chop. I don't like pork, so won't speak for that dish (he said it was good), but the scallops were freaking amazing. They were perfectly seared and crispy on the outside, but soft and tender inside. The gnocchi that came with it was homemade and perfectly cooked and the carrot butter really tied everything together well. YUM YUM YUM.

The decor is rustic-modern, if that makes any sense.  It's a small, casual, dark, trendy kind of place.  Our waitress was very friendly and was able to explain all the dishes in great detail.

It is pretty pricey here, though. There were 3 of us total; 2 appetizers and 3 entrees. No drinks or anything. Bill came to $207, and we weren't really that full after. Honestly, this restaurant has very good quality food, but for the price, I'd rather go eat at Quattro again. At Quattro, we got 3 appetizers, 3 entrees, and 2 glasses of wine for the same price and their food was amazing.
