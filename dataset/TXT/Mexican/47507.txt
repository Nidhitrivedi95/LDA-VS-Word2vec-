We ordered our food, which took about twice as long as Chipotle, even though it seemed this restaurant is trying to duplicate the model. The biggest problem was that we presented the Entertainment coupon for BOGO for lunch or dinner item. It was 12:15 so we assumed that qualified. Never before have we had a coupon with teeny-tiny writing specify it was valid from 2pm-5pm and after 8 pm. Why even bother creating such a coupon?? It will only upset people and make them feel tricked on their first visit, like it did us. The food was bland and didn't merit a second visit. The tortilla was too doughy and then got soggy from the juice of the pico de gallo salsa. Even if the food was awesome, we would not be back, due to the ill-intended coupon. Chipotle is a much better bet with consistently great food and service for a much better price.
