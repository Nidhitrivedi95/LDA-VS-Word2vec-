PF6IipxqHx0i2cFBAraXPw Food was good, slightly pricey for what you get but worth it every once in awhile. We asked for no lettuce on the tacos and still got lettuce. I asked for a sample of the rice and the guy gave me a little cup to try and when I got to the register the cashier tried ringing me up for a side of rice. She also realized she didn't ring up a tiny side of sour cream AFTER we paid so then she requested us to pay $0.67 for it. Such an inconvenience and it is a tablespoon of sour cream! Why would I need to be charged for that, even a gas station has more common sense.
