VCjrZPeRDBNQHq_qFQgclw My first visit after so many recomendations. Atmosphere common to many Mexican restaurants. Unique are the 3 different complimentary salsas serverd with chips. Different heat levels and all are great! We had the tacos darados Mexicanas and enchiladas verdes. Both were very good altough the enchiladas could have been heated a bit more. The Texas margaritas were very good! We will visit again!
