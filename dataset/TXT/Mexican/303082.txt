ZXC9HaHWeHnKKtbqX74Q_A This place is excellent! Huge burritos and quesadillas.. We can eat for around 10 bucks, and only because I order my bean and cheese burrito deep fried, so they add 2.00 for that 
, but it also comes with sour cream and guacamole. Don't care much for the chips- they don't taste good, Also bummed that they discontinued the whole grain tortillas, but we can deal. Service has always been very nice. Love this place!
