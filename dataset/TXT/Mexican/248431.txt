U8VXQaeog9wb_Y6hCkfitg 4.5 stars. Some of these negative reviews are totally out of left field. This might be the *best* non-chain fast food currently in town.

This is a great taco joint, the kind of taqueria someone visits who knows what tacos are supposed to taste like. The place is immaculately clean, service is fast, and they follow all of the most important rules:

Tacos have onion and cilantro and two tortillas. Chorizo is well seared and a little crispy. Beef tacos, while not so traditional, have an amazing tomato base that makes this place Taco Tuesday destination dining. Mexican coke. Three salsas of varying heat, all delicious. I agree that the steak tacos are a little firm, chicken is OK. They have all the other stuff like burritos and quesadillas too, but this is fundamentally a great taco joint.

Really, for these prices, quality, a parking lot, and proximity to campus (about 3.5 miles) this is future destination dining for the University of Illinois students after a few drinks. There's nothing this good by campus, and in a bad food town such as C/U this place deserves a lot of attention.
