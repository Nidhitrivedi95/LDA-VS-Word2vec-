BgQ5ob0QiZfO5YbgI7VyFw If you want New Mexican Food this is as good as it gets. I can not recall in all of my trips ever having a bad experience or bad food. The Adovada is the best ive ever had with either green or red sauce. Ive also had salads, the salmon, chimi's and serveral other dishes. Everything was great and better than most other places in town. Usually a resturant has one or two really good things on the menu - this place make it very hard to decide because its all good. Even the beans taste better here. And dont forget the drinks - marguritas are good, Sangria is always on the menu, Ive yet to find a place that compares.

Food is Superb
Service is Great
Atmosphere is Great
