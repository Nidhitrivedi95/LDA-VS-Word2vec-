6qKjl6xJQzLb9ka-QbTudA This is a mom & pop or family business which I love the concept ~ however the food was disappointing.
    Ordered 2 cheese enchiladas with red sauce, granted this should be basic, I asked what type of cheese? And was told mozzarella..... REALLY?  Anyway they were fine, nothing to write home about and the red sauce might have come from a can, although I didn't see it, I'd say it's a pretty good guess. The rice was typical Mexican rice with carrots & peas, not very memorable and the beans really weren't my cup of tea even if I did get past the grayish color ~
    I was sorry I didn't enjoy this more as I really like to support small family owned businesses however I can't imagine I will be going back, adios.
