DKXUkIrFnMUMF535gf-dPA I only ordered two things as I haven't eaten today and I made lasagna for dinner but I've heard great things about this place.  Immediately when you walk in the atmosphere is modern yet inviting. The workers are super sweet and I had a sample of the el pastor which was really yummy and cooked in a Shawarma type style   I ordered Carne Asada Mini Street Taco and Elote the whole reason I came here was for the elote.  

1.  The carne aside mini street taco was amazing for two reasons 1 the homemade tortillas that were the most delicious tortillas I've ever eaten ok top 3 at least I don't want my Latin friends to be insulted because they make amazing tortillas. 

2. The meat wasn't tough or dry and was cooked perfectly.  

The Elote the whole reason I came here since my favorite place closed down. 

My first thought when I bought into the elote was Yassss finally the grilled taste of the corn and the bite of spicy mixed with the Cojita cheese was just what I was waiting for.  Their elote is supreme and I am going to start coming here a lot more than I should.  

This is going to be an amazing place to take my clients.  I recommend anyone and everyone to go here !
