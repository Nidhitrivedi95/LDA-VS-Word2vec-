Drinks are great too. I eat a gluten free diet & their gluten free menu is extensive. My latest server, Sherrie, also was very helpful with accommodating my needs at lunch  (which required some creativity) so that I enjoyed a delicious gluten free vegetarian burrito bowl with added pibil pork. So good!
