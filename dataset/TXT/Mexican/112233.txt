G6BwYw_0_atLPTzI1uokIA This place is just off Fremont Street.  We went here for a late lunch and it was moderately busy.  

The service was prompt and friendly.  We all had drinks in a very short period of time.  The menu is pretty long - there is definitely plenty to choose from.  What I particularly like are the variations on standard Mexican dishes.  For instance, they have Thai chicken nachos and filet mignon nachos.  One of my friends sticks to a more vegetarian/vegan diet and this is the only Mexican place I have ever seen that has vegan options. 

I split the Supreme Tostada Nachos with a friend.  The food was delicious.  The nachos came out as a decent sized plate, more than enough to split if you're averagely hungry.  

The interior looks like it can be split in two, with sliding panels on top of a half wall so that it can split up the bar and the dining area.  I imagine this makes it better for families and helps keep the place a bit quieter.  

I'd definitely be happy to come back here.
