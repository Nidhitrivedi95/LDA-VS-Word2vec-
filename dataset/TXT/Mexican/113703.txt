gdtZA3sVQ5Hk-3oPBArdLA This is the best Zabas!  We ordered catering for 10 people and pickup the next morning. Arrived and the food was all ready for me to go. The chicken and beef were perfect... every dish that was supposed to be hot was piping hot at pickup and still hot when we went to serve everyone. Everything that was supposed to be cold was ice cold. They provided everything right down to the plates,napkins,utensils,and even the serving spoons we didnt have to worry about anything. They even carried everything to the car. The presentation of the food was awesone and eveyone at the party was super impressed. The food was delicious chicken and beef were marinated perfectly and the chipotle ranch dressing that the manager recommended was a hit with everyone! We would tell anyone that is looking for great catering for any event that they need to go to this zabas. Thank you to the entire staff for such a great experience! We will definitely be back.
