zwNLJ2VglfEvGu7DDZjJ4g Went to this restaurant yesterday with my wife, sister and her husband.  The place was very busy at 3pm but I dont have a clue as to why.  We were seated underneath a ceiling fan and it felt like a wind tunnel.  After four requests, they finally shut it off.  When we were seated there was only one table around us occupied.  We waited almost 30 minutes for the food while all the tables around us were filled and served their meals.  The waiter said the kitchen was chaos whatever that means.  
As far as the food, it was average at best.  The sauces were very salty and the chicken had been cooked the day before and warmed again.  The beans were like paste.  When ordering, we were asked if we wanted sour cream and Guac..  We said yes not knowing this would add an additional $5 to the tab.  Since when does a dollop of sour cream deserve a $1.50 charge.  And $2.50 for a small dollop of Guac..   Finally my wife had one of their famous .99 margaritas and if there is a nastier tequilla, I havent had it.   All in all a $30 waste and we will not be going back.
