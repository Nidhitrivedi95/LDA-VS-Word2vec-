MV9fUwgI2AQa4uZArynRlA Sometimes you have to eat somewhere to remember why you don't eat there anymore. Food was not good. Salsa was awful. Rice tasted "wierd" had a smoked flavor. The color of rice was off too. 
The beef taquitas were just okay . Nothing spectacular to say about any of the meal. Only that's why we remember we don't eat here .    Coupons are no good if you drink water ...  save your money and go to the Mexican restaurant down in Pineville called 
El Vera Cruz  - they don't disappoint!  Lesson learned! El Vera Cruz is the place to go for real authentic Mexican food that actually tastes good. Waitstaff are very accommodating!
