SWDxTrwU_qlEcJp36IYquw Well, I'm a Cuban guy who grew up in Miami. I am currently living in Northern Nevada and in the process of moving to Phoenix. In Northern Nevada, there is not a lot of diversity. This could be due the proximity to Lake Tahoe, and the abundance of snow during the winter. I miss, miss, miss, Cuban Food and nothing is more frustrating when people don't get it. I vent to friends how I miss the food and how lazy I am not learn how to cook it...and all they say is "dude, go to pepito's tacoria" NOOOOO DUDE, IT'S NOT THE SAME. MEXICAN FOOD AND CUBAN FOOD IS DIFFERENT! They don't know better. 

 I found this place, and I was hesitant. I went to a Cuban Restaurant in San Francisco, it was NOT Cuban food. The west coast had not treated me well in this area. When I arrived to the restaurant, I noticed it was a little hole in the wall near a DJ store and a Metro PCS. I immediately got excited; because, unless your going to Versailles, Cuban food is not fancy. 

 I ordered the bistec empanizado. I loved it. The portions were large, how it should be, and the steak was good. I was impressed. My girlfriend had the medianoche, and she liked it. She is a Northern Nevada blonde white girl, so I gauged her and asked "is it Latin America good?" Latin America being a prominent cuban sandwich place in Miami. She said that it was just as good. 

 Impressive.

 The business looks like it is somewhat new and just now getting clientele. I hope it does well. I love seeing my paisanos succeed. Get that money papo!

 But PLEASE, get a bathroom, really? No bathroom...conjone meng

 I am typing this on my phone, sorry for any grammar errors...
