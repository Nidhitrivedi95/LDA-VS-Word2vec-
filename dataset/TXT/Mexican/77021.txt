cJzv3fbd7jL2ZHyFosFkOw Very friendly staff. The food is your standard, run of the mill Americanized Chinese fare. Nothing incredibly special here. They serve decent portions for a great price (see the lunch specials). They even deliver! A really solid choice when you're feeling Chinese takeout. 

Note: Wong's Chicken is equivalent to General Tso's Chicken. I found this place because I wanted to find some really awesome General Tso's Chicken after watching the "Search for General Tso" documentary on Netflix. Highly recommended for anyone interested in food history.
