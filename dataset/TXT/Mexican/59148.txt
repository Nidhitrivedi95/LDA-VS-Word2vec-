AhPmh0NaRDbEYyhd9egzLA I went for a late lunch with friends and the place was still pretty packed at 2:30 on a Saturday. They have happy hour everyday of the week until 5pm, the prickly pear and watermelon margaritas were great and you can't beat the $5 price tag. We all ordered different tacos, the braised beer and the standard that I ordered were amazing! My boyfriend loved the shrimp and carne asada. We will definitely be back.
