IYpaW7h8aPYKIK84_ZKMIg Being truly Mexican this place isn't abuelas cooking but you know for this area its close enough. Great service and they spoke to me in spanish and English to see what I perfered. Bf got the taco which you dress yourself inside which is great. Then he got the combo plate of red tamale and enchilada which were tasty. 
I got the pollo loco which has a kick and ranchers beans which were s little salty but still edible. 
Good service
