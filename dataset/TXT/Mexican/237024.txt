SW6ZQk22G1_CV81_gfnvNQ Terrible service! It took us about 30 minutes to receive our food (and we just ordered tacos). Plus, the waiter messed up our order and brought us some of the wrong plates. He barely even apologized and then took an additional 15 minutes to bring us the correct plates. He  also forgot to warn us that we couldn't pay separately with our credit cards and gave us one large bill..

This resto has great potential. The location, atmosphere and food are awesome but the service sucks! I definitely won't be returning.
