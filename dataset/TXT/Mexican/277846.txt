xlXwxfiUD4bgJFKUYwkzOg Wouldn't waste your money. Lowest common denominator Mexican food, and way over priced.  My sister had small rubbery shrimp, I had street tacos a higher were very average. My vodka tonic had absolutely NO vodka, and the wait staff didn't once clear any plates or fill up our water glasses.  So many better places to eat at Green Valley ... Don't bother with this place.
