jlF81N1Hr9tANTfMSRWsLA First off, there was literally two other people in here so there was no wait at all. The staff were all very friendly and welcoming. My bowl actually turned out pretty hefty, which was definitely refreshing. Most other Chipotle locations that I've been to try to give you the least amount of food possible it seems. The place was clean and in a good location. I don't know that I'll find myself near this specific location again, but I would suggest it to anyone in the area.
