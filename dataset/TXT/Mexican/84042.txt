d4qwVw4PcN-_2mK2o1Ro1g After a brutal evening of music (Slayer and Lamb of God ftw!) I was in desperate need of some tasty, comforting food. I saw the sign for Pink Taco and I was totally sold as I love the Los Angeles location.
It wasn't crazy busy so we were easily seated and our waitress sorted our food out pretty quickly. I ordered the Guacamole, a Wet Steak Burrito and also one of their Jalapeno cocktails. The guac was tasty but I was mildly disappointed with my burrito, it seemed to lack the flavour of the ones I've had at the Los Angeles location. My cocktail was super tasty and very strong so it lasted me a while.

Definitely enjoyed the meal but probably wouldn't order the burrito again, I'll explore the menu a little next time.
