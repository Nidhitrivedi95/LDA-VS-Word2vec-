HU8MnV129kOK4m0ZH4GpCg Got here at 8:30pm on a Friday, was not seated until 9:50pm. We had corn - it turns out it was chips with dip. It took about an hour to get our food and about 20 minutes for drinks. Not sure if it because of all the hype. Waitress was very pleasant - I just think they are super busy here. Management please get on this.
