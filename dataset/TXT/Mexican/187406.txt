O1ird5yRyuDFnOmYu90OoA The service was good, and by a stroke of luck we got a table for four right away at 8 o'clock on a Friday night. But alas, I absolutely hate cilantro. I cannot stand it in any way. And everything they sell, except for the bean dip, has cilantro in it. Not one thing on the menu was sans cilantro, and the waitress said nothing could be made without it. So I basically ended up eating bean dip and chips for dinner. So, I can't say I enjoyed my experience there, and I definitely won't return. But if you like cilantro, then try it out!
