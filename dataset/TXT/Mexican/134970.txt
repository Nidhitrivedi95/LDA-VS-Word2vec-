iLxG2Oo8HNSZFvJvba4W6g The last time I was there, there was a cockroach crawling on my table. The cockroach then climbed onto a stand up menu. We pointed it out to the waiter and he took the menu and threw it on the floor and tried to stomp on the cockroach. We mentioned to the woman at the check out section that there was a cockroach and she gave us 10% off our order. She told me that they had recently sprayed for them, but apparently they were still a problem. She was very apologetic. 
It's a real shame because the food is not half bad. And many of the people who work there are quite nice. But I don't think I'll be eating there any time soon again...
