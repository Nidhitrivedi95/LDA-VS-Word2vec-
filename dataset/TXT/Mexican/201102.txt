phIL-dJoT8uztbdFgfk_3w i used to love fat bastards and ate some of their locations and they were good and most locations are alot fresher and do things properly, but this one falls behind the bar by a mile
you should avoid this place at all cost tbh, the place its just nasty so you all know i'll explain.

they cook during the week for their weekend which is horrible for a place that claims to be "fresh" they cook chicken/steak/pork on Wednesday and Thursday for friday/saturday. so if u come in on a weeked your meat would be a couple days old by now.

their fish is precook in the morning  and they just heat it up when u order it which is not bad except its batter so if you come at night you get a fish thats been sitting for hours in a warmer, not fresh at all

their staff is trained to be cheap as possible in the burritos , their reasoning "meat is expensive so give only a little"  if you order a burrito they place as little as possible meat in the burrito, order a naked and you get somewhat close to the actual portion you suppose to get, order both and you will see the difference in portions for the same size meal.

their yam is baked then chill and they reheated in the same fryer where fish is cook .

hopefully fat bastard head office reads this and does something about it.

you can confirm this when they pull meats from the fridge they are label with dates so if you have good vision you can catch the date when it was made. watch their fish or yam when they throw it in the fryer and you can see the fish was already cook.
