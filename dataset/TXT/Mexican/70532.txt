BZtNKLg1S9k8s6fYkR1quQ My husband and I went to try this place out yesterday.
Being honest I was not impressed at all. I read the reviews before we go and was expecting way more than what we got.
The empanada was okay, for entree we both decided on carne assada that came with salad, rice, beans and plantain, I asked that waiter to switch the plantain for fried cassava and she said that she couldn't. ???? The food was just regular. We also order pork crackling that was way over cooked and over seasoned.  
The place it is simple which is no big deal but wasn't clean the way it was supposed to be and a huge spider jumped on my lap while I was eating. 
The waitress was very attentive only down side was she looked not to be familiar with the menu. In my opinion the food is WAY overpriced for what we get. This being said we will not be back.
That being sad we won't be back.
