FTo64sohiSRBRM9e9NzeAQ What other place in Madison gives you guacamole and chips gratis? For this and other reasons, El Sabor de Puebla is a bang for your buck. If you're a person who appreciates a good taco or huarache, you will like it. (Same goes for mole.) If you're a person who veers toward less authentic fare and expects a gargantuan margarita, then forget it. It's a no frills place. But what they do, they do well, and the prices can't be beat for this neighborhood. One huarache will feed you. One mole dish will feed you for days. If you live on this side of town and aren't within a stone's throw of Naty's or Taqueria Guadalajara, this is your place.
