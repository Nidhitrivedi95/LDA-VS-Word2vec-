fK1oj0dk9Bc6KsBk5mMDxg For my money, this is about as good as it gets if you want gourmet-style Mexican around Toronto. The decor in this place is over the top -very creative use of wood, post-industrial re-purposed materials and traditional Mexican decor. It's got a hint of hipster (like most things in the junction) but if you can get by all that, you'll find a menu with enough variety to make you want to come back at least a few times. The Al Pastor tacos were off the charts while the rice and beans was exactly what you'd expect "gourmet Mexican" to taste like. 

While I enjoy the similarly-styled "La Carnita" on College st, the Milagro quality downtown on Mercer and the authenticity of El Arrieros on Jane st, P.C. Cantina gets my vote for best overall experience.
