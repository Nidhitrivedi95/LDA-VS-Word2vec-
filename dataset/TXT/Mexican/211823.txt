qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A Greeted at the door by the best owner/manager/host/bartender/person/friend in the vicinity. The unlimited mimosas appear out of no where, like...bam!!! More alcohol, and more alcohol! The food is in proportions where you need to share. But the food tastes so good, you want to keep it all to yourself. The flavor is something that is so unique, I don't understand why they aren't franchising this place. I would go here in every city I go too. Did I mention the food is freakin' awesome. Brunch here on Sunday alone is worth a trip to Vegas! Thank you for having us!
