EVbEdWYLE9GDpVG97MGw-w I am gonna take a different approach than most reviewers on my beloved Macayo's Depot Cantina. Mainly because I have never ordered anything off the menu, and I have only gone on Friday nights. I am a college kid and there are three things than any college kid loves:
1.  Free Food- They have a buffet style chips salsa and queso bar that equals free friday dinner to me!
2.  Cheap Drinks- Gotta LOVE the $2 Dos Equis
3. Fun Music- Yes, they do take requests on the patio.

I have danced away many a night at Macayo's Depot Cantina!! and it gets a five star rating in my book!
