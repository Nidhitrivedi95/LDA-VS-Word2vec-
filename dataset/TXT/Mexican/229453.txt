sDyTfafJfhb_5ewii6TEjg Me and my boyfriend bought burritos to bring inside the movies a few nights ago. To my surprise the burritos actually had good flavour. The hot sauce was actually hot unlike most places that promise you spicy and never deliver. However, I am only giving mucho burrito 3 stars because they still are not better then burrito Boyz. Burrito Boyz has more ingredients to choose from, different proteins (halibut, shrimp and tofu), they actually grill their burritos till they are warm and crunch (I'm sorry but that panini press at mucho burrito doesn't do your burritos justice) and its cheaper. So once all those things are improved I may rank you higher than burrito Boyz but until then they are my first choice.
