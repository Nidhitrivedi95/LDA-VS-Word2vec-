VIJ2KiDKhUVhhpNylEIfog Best Mexican food in Chambana (and anywhere else that I've eaten)! That is all that needs to be said about the food.

The place is tiny with very limited seating and limited parking. If you go during lunch or dinner rush, your best bet is to get food to go or even call ahead and order for pickup.

I recommend the asada burrito, but you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.
