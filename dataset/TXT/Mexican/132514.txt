IfdwBSEuDK3fKvVHVX9k0A I've given Tree Huggers three tries. All three were strikes and this place is out. 

Visit 1. I bought $40 for $20 on Mimi's Deals. My bf and I went for coffee and to use the tables to work on our homework. We bought a bunch of stuff to go. We noticed that the pound of coffee we bought was not included. It's a 15 mile drive, so I called. They told me to call back when the manager was in the next day. I called the next day, they suggested I use the "contact me" on their website. I gave it a week and never heard back so I called. They basically called me a liar. $$$ down the drain. 

2. I stopped in with my friend who is from Berea but moved ten years ago. We wanted to buy a water and a cafe mocha. It took 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge me. Then someone said hi, took my order and 20 minutes later I had a mocha. 30 minutes for a mocha? It wasn't even good. 

3. I stopped in for coffee and cookies with a friend. We sat down and no one came out to greet us for a half hour. We left. 

I bought 3 deals from Mimi. I gave the rest to a friend who lives closer. It's out of the way for me. I won't be back.
