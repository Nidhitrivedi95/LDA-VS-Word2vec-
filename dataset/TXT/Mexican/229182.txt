sCewr7cA5ra7yd6jBfEe9A I wasn't expecting much out of Rubio's but I'm always down to try new fish tacos. The place was dead when we walked in, very sterile.. Chipotle's older uncle with no personality. The salsa bar was the saving grace, lots of options in varying degrees of heat. 

I was surprised on the price point for an order at the counter joint,  it wasn't cheap. They also charged for chips and salsa. WHAAATT!!!!

All in all it was pretty good. I got the coastal grill, shrimp, fried fish and ono taco. Not too shabby.

There are so many authentic places nearby in the same price range, don't know if I would come back.
