k-drEjxKmfqllwfY90STfA Ordered two top shelf tacos, as seen in the receipt. What was delivered were two regular tacos, one was beef which I can't even eat. Tried to call and after 12 attempts the line was either busy, call failed, or was disconnected? This was the whole reason we had to order online in the first place. Not only was I delivered the wrong food after paying for the more expensive tacos however I was delivered a meat I can't eat. Now I can't get in touch with the restaurant to get refunded. DO NOT RECOMMEND DELIVERY THROUGH DOOR DASH!!!
