nEQFnHydeX2A3bRRDAKqQg Finally decided to try Chuy's . My expectations for the food itself may have been a little more than actual experience but overall it was okay.

The ambience was Fun Friday kinda of feel. Big colorfully decorated museum/fun house flow. Good drinks which provide a lot of bag for your buck. Never ending warm chips to compliment various salsa options. Make sure to inquire about the choices, our waiter never told us you could get other styles besides the typical fresh cantina style.

Now for entrees... I ordered the waiter recommend "Chica Chica Boom Boom. Shredded chicken wrapped in tortilla covered in spicy cheese sauce. It was just okay and maybe a little better with creamy jalapeño sauce. Hubby had Ron Chille, huge spicy stuffed with shrimp peppers deep fried and drizzle with creamy sauce. He thoroughly enjoyed the dish. Different from your typical Tex Mex dishes.

For dessert we of course ordered the popular tres leche cake. This may be a specialty and well known dessert but not for me. Tasted like a weird almost cornbread consistency type of cake with Carmel drizzle and sweet cream. Definitely could have done without the extra calories from the couple of spoonfuls had. So again overall rating=Just Okay
