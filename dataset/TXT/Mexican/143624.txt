JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg We ate here for lunch and Juan was our server. We had the tostada salad, short rib tacos, jalapeño margarita, and flan. Food I would give 3 stars it's all quality ingredients and freshly made which is something I always look for but can be hard to find. Atmosphere 2 stars. Service 3 stars. The tacos were good but a small portion for the price was the only down side. I would probably come again and give this place a second chance at least.
