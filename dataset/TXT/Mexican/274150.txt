X57f6FWZiwI1wOidPPhOrQ There are only two Mexican restaurant's I will patron...... DOS is very first choice always. Good service from very friendly professional wait staff as well as great food. Never a wait ..... timing is everything. This is a very popular place at meal times. You are never rushed out to "turn" a table. In 10 years never a bad experience. The lunch take out very timely as well.  Never experienced anything like it anywhere else in CU.
