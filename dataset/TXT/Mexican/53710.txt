9q0s7-EfafubLeLUJg_7BQ I had the seafood soup and it was good.  Wife had the breaded beef and it was good but not great.  Service was great.  Pork and cheese pupusas were the great (5 out of 5 stars).  I liked that they made them within eye shot.  The Regio lager imported beer was very good too.  Pupusas + imported Salvadorian beer + service earned it four stars.
