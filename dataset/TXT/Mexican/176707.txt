MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA I finally got into this place without the line-up! The secret is showing up before 6pm on a weekday night. The hip hop blasting was great because you can bob your head along while chomping down on tiny tacos. 

My fav was the beef cheek which wasn't on the menu the last time I went. The baja fish taco was also good because the fried fish is balanced by the fresh beets/radish (I think that's what it was) which has a cooling crunchy effect.

The bourbonade is stronger than it looks. And if you're into the bourbon, there's an entire wall showcasing a variety of selections. I'd stick to the tacos though since I wasn't too into the sides. The pineapple dessert is "dope" according to the chalk board menu, but I'll have to try it next time. Those tiny tacos are surprisingly filling and will add up on your bill. Remember, cash only!

The bathroom is a 1ft x 1 ft stink hole that you have to fall down a set of narrow stairs to get to. Avoid.
