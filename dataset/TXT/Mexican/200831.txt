PgdQrTSOX132EgNj8VPNlg I love Mad Mex but on several occasions now their Sunday night bartender has been just terrible. Before we moved a little farther away from the Robinson location we always had exceptional service from Heath and Lucy. This other guy just does not seem to care about the customers at all. His timing is terrible, he isn't friendly and he never has remembered us despite having seen our faces at the bar many times now. I've always enjoyed the food at Mad Mex and their rotating list of craft beer is exceptional. I will definitely return but I would not recommend visiting the bar on a Sunday night.
