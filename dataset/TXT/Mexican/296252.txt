zCmwErM82hdKl4L2UixDJw This is honestly my favorite place to eat! Their tofu taco is phenomenal. The ingredients taste so fresh, and the salsas and sauces really spice it up. Happy hour is from 4-7 and 9-11 and features $1 off tacos (tacos are usually $3 and specialty tacos are $4) and 1/2 off margaritas. It's in the bar area only though.
