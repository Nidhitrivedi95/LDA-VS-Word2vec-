knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw Decided to try this place out as the place we really wanted to go to, The Brewer and the Butcher, was closed. We were seated quickly, but the waiter was a pretentious little douche. Got really huffy when we asked if they had Coke or Pepsi. 

The real waitress came over and took our bar order. Just a Dragonberry mojito for the lady. They were out of the Dragonberry. So she just got a regular one. It was average at best. A bit weak if you ask me. 

We tasted the salsa that was brought out. The chips were fresh and very good. The salsa was the definition of bland. Basically just "tomato water". If you want to try a more flavorful salsa you need to pay $3 extra. I got the El Diablo salsa as I like it spicy. It was just the "tomato water" again with what tasted like Franks Red Hot dumped in it. 

Gf ordered the chicken burrito and said it was really good. I got the steak chimichanga with refried beans. The beans were more like soup and were ice cold. Waitress said the were just heating things up in the kitchen. No excuse for cold food. The chimi was average even though it was chicken and not steak. At this point I just dealt with it. We asked for a box when the same douche that sat us came over. He seemed really bothered that we asked him

We've tried a few restaurants in this area. We won't be back to this one. I don't expect it to be here for much longer if the food doesn't improve.
