a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg I went in for lunch yesterday, reluctantly, since I have been to Casa Don Juan thrice before over the last few years and always order something that I cannot bring myself to eat.  I ordered something different (cheese enchilada and relleno with a side of rice and beans), and this time, it was by far the worst.  The sauce on the enchilada tasted canned (and not even good canned- I happen to like las palmas enchilada sauce), the beans tasted canned, and the relleno could not easily be identified as a relleno.  It was a pile of mush with tasteless red sauce slathered over it.  I am a local and a Mexican, and I have for years and years tried to like this place to support local business, but the mere thought of being invited to lunch here makes me cringe.  Please get better.  I gave them two stars for ambiance and service.  Food alone would've been a zero. Also, please DO NOT insult Mexican food by calling this authentic.  That it is not.
