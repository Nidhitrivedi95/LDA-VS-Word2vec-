SZpzMUdhh1xu2qlegzSyLg Looking for a light lunch that didn't start in the high double digits, we finally found Tortilla Flats.

The place was dark and not very welcoming, with a jumble of tables and chairs which you wind through to get to the "Please Wait to be seated" sign. Kind of superfelous, since we were the only customers in the place.

A lone bartender was visible and after a pause came to seat us.  We opted for the outdoor seating which was brighter.

A lack-lustre waitress showed up with menus, after a while.

As suggested by the name, the food choices were mainly Tex-Mex.  My partner chose the Huevos Rancheros  and I had the Chicken Caesar Wrap.

When the food eventually arrived (pretty sure they had to go to the farm to get the chicken and the eggs), it was generous proportions and quite tasty.

So dark and dingy inside, lousy service, cluttered tables which interfere with entry and exit, but decent food and moderate prices.

Would we go back? Only if we were on Queen Street and starving and couldn't find a better spot. Unfortunately, what drove us there in the first place was the lack of reasonable eatery choices in that section of Queen.  We think that restaurants are charging outrageous prices ($13.00 for a BLT) because they CAN; because it's a trendy area. (I suppose we could have gone to KFC or Subway ... but we don't feel either one serves actual food.)
