5o7Fx7Iot-gLKVNegLLw-w I would actually give a negative star if I could. This is NOT Guatemalan. It's Mexican food. We went there and weren't greeted. Sat down waited for service. When I ordered a Guatemalan beer she said we don't have that. WHAT??? they had modelo. Then they had one, maybe 2 Guatemalan dishes but had a whole page of "Mexican entrees". The server was RUDE and ignored us. They had 2 different types of music playing at the same time and it was Mexican not Guatemalan. We drank a corona and decided NOT to eat there. We will NEVER be back and they shouldn't advertise Guatemalan. So very disappointed. I have nothing against Mexican food in fact I love it but I wanted Guatemalan food and this wasn't the place!
