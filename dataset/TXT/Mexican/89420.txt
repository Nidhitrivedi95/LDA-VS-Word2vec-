drpzuRdT2xZql-wJhTC3gg I am writing this as loyal customer of 10 plus years. 

Unfortunately this location is a complete sh!t show. Regardless of what time you arrive, the crew is without leadership, guidance, or a general direction. They are rude, incompetent, and overall a hindrance to the designed 'burrito' assembly line. The supervisor roles are even less qualified and make obvious where that lack of attention and rudeness comes from. 

Now I am not being overly dramatic, if anything I am holding back. In the last six times I have gone, every order has been like pulling teeth or in general just wrong; especially if you were to order online for pickup. They are never on time, might as well just order in person because it will end with less stress and the correct product. 

I.E. my typical order is for a tortilla lined bowl, with extra rice, black beans, chicken with extra steak, red sauce, corn salsa, cheese, lettuce and gauc, a $12 dollar meal without chips, and what do I actually receive; a burrito with rice and chicken. No joke, that is it.
