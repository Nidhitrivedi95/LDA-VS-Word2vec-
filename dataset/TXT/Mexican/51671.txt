9Bg2JLQdyf97KlNuRQ56HA Love the burritos here. They are served tasting so fresh and the green salsa is amazing. If I could bathe in only one green sauce it would be los favoritos. It's like 15x better than taco bells Verde sauce and let me tell you I love that stuff. Sometimes I think about asking to buy just a cup of it to drink and skipping the burrito. Eating to go is always distressing bc I can't get enough sauce. I prefer los favoritos locations where the sauce is already available to grab and you don't have to ask. It makes the amount of sauce I use feel less shameful. Taking one Star away for that. Other locations 5 star. Plan to move closer to another location soon to correct this travesty.
