d_L-rfS1vT3JMzgCUGtiow What a sad disappointment. The worst shrimp tacos I've had in vegas. The nice part was they were ready in 3 minutes, but I would have been happy to wait longer for $19 shrimp tacos.... literally it was soggy, cold shrimp in a tortilla... nothing else. Being a local I've not heard good things about this place, was hoping people were wrong. They aren't. What a disappointment.
