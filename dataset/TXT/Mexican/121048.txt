H2Chxto2e6dHTDJ8-s3-pQ I like Roberto's, been to several other location, this one isn't as nice.

Question first: Isn't it standard to get sour cream with burrito?  Maybe I've been spoiled by Taco Bell lol.  

Charged $0.95 for sour cream.  Which is fine even though I thought sour cream was standard. When I got the carne asada burrito, there was no sour cream in it!  I took it to the counter, and she says, (i'm paraphrasing because she didn't speak english very well) see that green?  You see how it's not all green?  How it has a milky white to the green?  Well that's the sour cream mixed in.  Okay, so for $0.95 I get a hint of sour cream.  

I asked for a cup of water, she turns on the sink water and throws it in a cup, because apparently the soda machine doesn't have a "water" option on it. 

The carne asada meat was saltier than normal.
