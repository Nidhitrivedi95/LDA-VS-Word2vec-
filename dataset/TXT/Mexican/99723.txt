eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg Had a fun time with 3 friends on Friday night. Hostess said wait was 50 min, but we were at our table in 15. Not bad. Also I guess the bartender poured an extra glass of the Nebiola so she gave it to me for free.  Delicious. I usually don't like drinking red in the summer, but this was smooth and slightly jammy. Good move on her part because my friends enjoyed the wine so much we all ordered glasses ($11 a glass). 

There was live entertainment with a guitarist which perked up the whole restaurant even more. 

I didn't care so much for the bread they served. We started with appetizers: guacamole and queso fundido. Both were  excellent. The queso is a bit heavy and we only had a few bites each to make room for our entrees.  The conchinita pibil was excellent--tender slow-roasted pork with mash potatoes on the side. Large enough portion that I brought the leftovers home and it fed me and the roomie the next evening. YL had the enchilades de hongos which she enjoyed. 

For dessert we shared the flan de mi mami. Nice.
