7GGJlp1aWfcXGQz6q7SkXQ We were looking for a quick bite before seeing mystere at treasure island.  We found ourselves here after wandering around the area.  They were a bit understaffed considering it was a holiday (or so they said) even though it was not really crowded.  We had to move sections after the person at the front bar said they could not serve food.  The waitress at the back bar was nice though.  Rockhouse is probably a better place to meet up with friends,  grab a drink and grab some food once you have had a few rather than a place to plan dinner.  The food was just okay.  We had pulled pork sliders and the chicken nachos.  The sliders were not bad and the nachos were like the nachos you get at a ballpark.  Neither were much to write home about.
