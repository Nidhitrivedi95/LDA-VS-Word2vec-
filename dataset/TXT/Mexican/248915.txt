ucJ17aXhHoIYmHrneOLI-A The service was superb. The manager Julio stopped by twice to make sure everything was good. The food was superb. The fajitas were incredible. The hot salsa was really hot, the chips were warm and low in salt.  The frozen one margarita was perfect.  This place has the best ambience of any Mexican restaurant in Cleveland.  Will definitely be going back.
