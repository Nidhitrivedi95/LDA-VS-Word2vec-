cUFBO-5Fgd7pR0JUakWXSw Just had a fabulous dinner at the mission at Kierland! The at the table guacamole  was some of the best I've had. Will definitely be going back for their margaritas. Love the restaurant, the layout with outdoor eating space for perfect spring evenings like tonight and overall great vibe. Jamar went above and beyond on his customer service one of the reasons we will definitely go back!
