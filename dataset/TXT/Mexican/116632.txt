A few friends and I came into the restaurant 30 minutes before closing, and they were cleaning up already. We ventured inside, but we should've turned back as soon as we saw the employees giving us the dirtiest looks. We apologized for coming in so "late" and she gave the shadiest smile, and proceeded to DUMP our food onto our tortillas and bowls. The cashier was also shady, but she wasn't as bad. Then they give us looks and giggle throughout our whole stay. They're rude. Sorry for being an inconvenience, even though it's still operating hours.
