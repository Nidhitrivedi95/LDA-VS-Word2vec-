_kzB_xsb9DHUPfXB0XfQGA Wife and I came here after church today. We had a hankering for some good Mexican food as we had been a patron of the original 1511 on East Blvd. the place was not bust but probably about a third to half full. We were seated right away. Our server was johnny on the spot and took drink orders. That's where the quick service ended. The drinks finally came and we ordered the fajita platters. We waited an inordinate amount of time. When we finally got our food it was warm to hot but not sizzling fajita hot if you know what I mean. We witnessed another table that ordered fajitas and these was. Smoking hot and sizzling. Not sure what the issue is but that's why we gave the two star rating. 

Chips and salsa was great. The waitress was friendly but there is an issue here that needs addressed. We will give them another try again in the future.
