SEjyjYlMfFFzkHaru6JadA I had high hopes for this place. For me; and this might not be the case for everybody, but the best way to check a restaurant on authenticity is by the way the food is prepared. The place was nice and welcoming and the fact that it's 24 hrs is great! Who wants to always go to Denny's? So this is very good, but I was here for the food.  I ordered #14, taco, enchilada and chile relleno. 
The good: the relleno and enchilada(cheese) were good, not excellent, but above average.
The bad: the taco...I requested a hard shell taco with shredded beef. This is where authenticity comes in. Mexicans will relate; a hard shell taco is a corn tortilla folded and  deep fried with the meat inside. Then the cheese, lettuce and salsa are added by the eater or cook after. What came to me was a mission tortilla hardshell. Something you get at Taco Bell and Del taco, it wasn't good. This is what we call a lazy Mexican taco. Now, they might have their reasons, but I don't think it's reason enough to offer this atrocity. The beans were bland and undercooked and the rice was salty. I don't want to knock it too much, but, I hope this helps them improve. I will give it another try for breakfast.
