AhQu7mLtmGlp8U2I-SV_jA Oh god- this place is terrible! I'm late to review this, but tried it out when it first opened.  Living in the neighborhood, I was so excited to finally be getting a local mexican place and then so quickly and swiftly disappointed.  

Everything here is bland, bland, bland.  I'm not even sure how they managed to accomplish that.  I went with 2 friends, we had 2 burritos, a salad, and chips. This review goes for all of it equally. The food is totally flavorless, and somewhat overpriced for what it is.  

So, as another reviewer has mentioned do not think Chipotle..because this place is so much worse. If you are craving a good burrito and are in the area, please save your dollars and head to Ohio City Burrito instead. You will be happy you did.
