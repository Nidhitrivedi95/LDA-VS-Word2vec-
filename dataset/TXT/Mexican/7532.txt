They make a great margarita and always have good beers on tap...happy hour is a blast! Nice place to unwind after work, lots of business people go there. Dining in the main floor is hit or miss though; food is good but wait staff needs to step it up...service is a little slow if it's filled up. Nice place for a group or family. Very kid friendly. I'd say a 7.5/10 experience combined-food, service, and cantina area.
