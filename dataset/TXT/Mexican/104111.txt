fbQaKW0Lte0JQ_opbnjdKg Kind of the same experience three years later. I did not read my previous review and made some similiar mistakes. I added cole slaw for free which adds nothing and got half corn and half flour and did not try either the soup or cornbread. The end results through were still similar with chicken enchiladas with smoky red sauce covered in cheese. Two meals were about $20...not bad.
