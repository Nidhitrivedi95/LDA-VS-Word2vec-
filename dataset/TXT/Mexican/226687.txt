S-oIZWzHhTRF3iqqQMvYoA Nice option for fast fresh Mex food. Grab starters like their Zabapeno balls or the queso blanco with light salty chips like we did. Create your meal by selecting grilled steak, chicken, shredded beef, pork carnitas or lime Chipotle shrimp or fish. Then add the typical  toppings or sides to create a bowl, burrito, tacos, or other dishes. 

If you don't feel up to fashioning your own meal, there are Zaba specials, too. My guy ordered the fish tacos trio on corn tortillas. He was hungry to begin with, but the tacos were hefty enough to have him say "no mas" after devouring only two tacos.  My hand picked bowl of grilled steak with brown rice, black beans, fajitas veggies, salsa, cheese and sour cream hit the hunger spot, too.

The wait was short when we arrived, but stretched to the door after we sat down. Fortunately, the line moved quickly with friendly service. 

Again, nice option, nothing fancy, but satisfying.
