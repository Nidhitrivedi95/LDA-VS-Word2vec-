mES9E5K4HbYoPFXGv0pUuw I love the service here because everyone is warm and friendly, which is always worth a trip back, just to hear a story about Mexico.

I had the pazole which is only offered Friday evenings and on Saturdays - delicious mix of braised pork and corn in a soup - a really hearty meal! Their sweet empanadas looked really delicious, but alas, I was too full to even pop in dessert.

Highly recommend this place if you like great service and affordable meals that actually fill you up.
