br2M2b-CsXI0HY0RXvHl0w I agree that the food here is on the pricier side, but nothing majorly overpriced or anything. The tables need a SERIOUS scrub down. The other location was worse. The tables were so sticky I didn't want my arms or hands near them. I grabbed a napkin to try and wipe some off, and black reside came off, but it didn't help. That was kind of a flag for me, but you can see the food prep area as you order and it looked clean enough.
I ordered taquitos and nachos. I never got my taquitos, unfortunately, but they also didn't charge me for them. We ordered, told them what toppings we wanted, then we sat down. A man who I presume to be the manager brought cutlery and napkins to our table, though I saw some yelp reviewers remind us not to forget to bring some. He brought us about 6 napkins each and we needed them!!! The nachos were amazing. I had the nachos with chili and the chili was definitely the highlight, soooo sooo good.
We also did get tortilla chips and salsa prior to our meal, complimentary. I agree with others that the chips didn't taste super fresh, which was kind of disappointing. I have gone to chain tex-mex places and gotten hot, fresh tortilla chips so I would kind of expect it from a so-called authentic hotspot like this. The salsa itself was good but nothing extraordinary. The guacamole was chunky but far too onion-y for my taste. I'll skip it next time.
I will return here, probably for nachos. I'd love to try some chili cheese fries after tasting the amazing chili.

Side note: my friend got the enchiladas and they were good too, big portion, but she said she'll be getting nachos next time!
