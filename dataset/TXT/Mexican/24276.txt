2vr2yGIzSehe_ITFamNpyw I had the 3 taco combo. 2 asada and 1 lengua. It came with beans, rice and a drink. 2 people got their food first who lid for theirs after me. When my food arrived the tacos were decent. Not the best, but not bad at all! However, the rice and beans were cold. Not like warm, but cold. I told someone that took my order (not wearing a company shirt) and she came back about 3-4 minute's later with a little paper boat with Very EXTREMELY hot beans and rice. Just like it was microwaved. Both items felt the same temp. Which made the rice very soggy and inedible. 


So I MAY come back in a few months and try again. It could be growing pains... So j will give the benefit of the doubt.... This time...
