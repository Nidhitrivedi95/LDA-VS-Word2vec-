1M1A-s6BbnzK3eURw01rZQ I died in the bay and went to heaven at El Rincon Honduereño. As a kid I remember eating real Pastelitos (here they call them Empanadas - don't believe them they are Pastelitos) the ones here are made with shrimp for me as a kid and just simply delicious here. Pollo Fritos is a true Catracho interpretation with tajaditas. All and all price was low and the quality was high. Very tasty all around. A must visit in your Las Vegas trip next time.
