cUFBO-5Fgd7pR0JUakWXSw Went in to just enjoy a cocktail at the bar. Every time I've been the rules have changed. They always had shared tables in the bar area but tonight they just happened to have it reserved. The upstairs bar was closed even though restaurant was packed. For two loyal locals we were treated poorly. They seemed to care more about tourist business rather than those that will support them through their slow months - Arizona summers. Thought this would be a great go to place after work (next door),
but thought wrong. Very disappointed.!!!!
