IkMwuS3eViVHK09npuG1jQ Me and my boyfriend was exited to know that they have an el pollo loco in summerlin. So we been coming most of the times. I've always give them the benefit to correct the mistake but today I've finally had it. First thing walking in here I feel like I'm in a ghetto area. You would thing they would clean up the place by it really dirty inside.   I order a 3 taco meal and my taco was cold. So brought in up to the front  and the manager she told its supposed to be that way. I'm not idiot taco are not cold and it hurt my tooth. She went ahead and  give me a new one after she went to my table her remarks "I hope that's warm enough for you" she said it in a sarcastic way.  2nd thing as we were waiting for our meal I had to asked someone to clean the tables yea she did halfway done. And the drinks has no taste at all. It wasn't even busy but they couldn't have employee to walk the area and clean.
