_WtxQbDK7B-ExGdeG-2j6Q I had been wanting to try this place for so long and recently my husband and I decided to splurge for our anniversary dinner. I had heard that the downstairs had great atmosphere, but upon arrival, it felt more like a sports bar. We decided to head upstairs where the music wasn't quite so loud. We had good service once we got up there and the atmosphere was decent. Unfortunately, the food left so much to be desired; which is unfortunate when you're celebrating a special occasion. 

We ordered an appetizer of crab stuffed mushrooms, which were on the small side and could have used some bread to soak up the extra sauce. They were just "okay" and I wouldn't recommend them. Next came our salad which was huge but uninspiring. The dressing was bland and it consisted of an enormous amount of lettuce with some croutons and a few cherry tomatoes. We both ordered the seafood tagliatelle which consisted of two shrimp and two scallops on a bed of overcooked pasta without much of a sauce (was it just a blob of butter?) for $27 a pop. We thought we might at least enjoy our dessert, but that was disappointing as well. We ordered the trio which consisted of tiny versions of creme brulee, flourless chocolate cake (the highlight) and cheesecake. Both the creme brulee and cheesecake were thin in consistency and not very memorable.  This was such a disappointing way to spend our special evening and our hard-earned money. This seems like a better place to get a cocktail than to have a meal.
