RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg I was staying around the corner from Tacos El Gordo in Las Vegas and it was late and I was hungry.  I started walking down the street looking for something, I didn't want fast food, I didn't wan t a fancy restaurant and I didn't want a chain place.  All of a sudden I saw Tacos El Gordo!  Front the outside It looked like the place all the locals would go, and then on the inside I was the only non Spanish person there! I felt out of place for about 30 seconds but quickly got over it.  The menu on the wall isn't very descriptive and it's a little challenging to figure out what to order where, but with the use of my IPhone looking words up I quickly figured out what I wanted, I took another 2 minutes and stepped back and then I figured out what to order where.  I think I ordered 2 Taco De Asada which are 2 steak tacos with a red sauce and guacamole and onion and then I also ordered 2 Adobada Tacos which are spicy pork!  They were all delicious.  After you get your food you walk across the restaurant to pay,  this is where I have a small issue.  There was a little display with some desserts and I have a sweet tooth, I started asking the lady at the register what each item was and she basically told me she wasn't helping me, if I didn't know what it was then tuff.  WOW, kinda rude, and I can only assume because I'm not Spanish.  I paid and left.  I gave it three stars because of the rude lady at the checkout and the little bit of confusion I had ordering and the fact the menus wasn't very descriptive of what certain items were.
