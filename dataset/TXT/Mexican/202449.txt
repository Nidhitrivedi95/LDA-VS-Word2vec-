pomGBqfbxcqPv14c3XH-ZQ The food is bad and the service is worse. We've been there 3 times hoping it would get better but it never did. We will not be back. Michoacán is also nearby and the food is 10x better! I wish Leticia's was good because it's right around the corner from our house but sadly it's not worth the time. Such a bummer since we love Mexican food.
