At first it seems to be traditional Mexican food that takes you back home, and the staff is very friendly/attentive to your order. It may have been a bad day for them but the food I ordered was not that great. It seems to be more of an Americanized Mexican cuisine, and in my opinion didn't have that traditional Mexican spark. I ordered a Carne Asada burrito with beans, rice and a few of the fixings yet wasn't amazed as the flavors were very bland. My friend however ordered a Fajita Mix plate which was more appealing to my taste. I may eventually return to give it a second chance and try something different.
