Rv4aYEKmRsLrijjtq5CS5Q First time ..very clean place, the cashier was friendly and polite. I ordered carne asada tacos legit street tacos and very flavorful. I was thrill to see they have beef tongue and beef head. Please don't take those off, ever!!!!! Also i saw they have goat stew??!!! I am going to try that next time for sure! I give four star for two reason we had some sliced cucumber and it wasn't fresh at all that my kids had to throw it away and the salsa in the taco was too spicy which I didn't know (maybe I should ask next) but other than that everything was good!
