2JUDgnmoLDxD97gqmand9Q 4+ stars and yet...the first thing I have to point out is that I think it's very aggravating when you point out a problem to a restaurant and they don't care.

Take Chipotle.  I really like the place.  Sure, sometimes the people working there seem to have failed at McDonald's and now are making my burrito.  But, can't we all just get along?

Twice in the past few months the "to go" packaging has failed or almost failed.  The first time was NOT this location.  They gave me my money back and wanted back the slop that had fallen through their inferior packaging onto the parking lot pavement.  This time, at this location, the crappy corrugated bowl holding the burrito failed.  Just the worst.  I even called corporate in Denver and the sh*thead I talked to had all the answers and no answers at all.  Supposedly new packaging was forthcoming.  That really was 4 or 5 months ago.

Now the food: go in and watch for 30 minutes.  Watch the kitchen.  Watch them season the rice, make the guacamole or chop up the chicken.  All right in front of you.  This is a chain and yet they make the food in front of you every bit like you'd want a Mom-and-Pop to do.
Great food, usually one meal is two meals.  "Half now, half for dinner" could be their slogan.

I get a chicken burrito bowl and I'm telling you, for $6.83 ($6.25 for the burrito + tax) you get two meals or one really, really big meal that is delicious.  And not even the crappy packaging can spoil that...if you're careful.
