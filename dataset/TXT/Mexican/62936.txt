aXRrMXXoAN7lawHICgmsxw First time here for dinner on a Wednesday night. Very cool decor. Friendly staff greeted us at the door.  Explained the menu and the concept of the restaurant. We order the Ro Ro Burger, Shrimp and chips and yakatori. The open kitchen is very cool. Dinner was fantastic? We went back a 2nd time.  The menu did not interest us so. Nice place and nice people.
