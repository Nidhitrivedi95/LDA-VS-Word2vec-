7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA Lady Marmalade, it hurts me to do this since I've been praising how marvelous the breakfast is here but my last visit was, in the great words of Morrissey, truly disappointing.
Why is it when you rave about how great a place is and you even make your parents wait in the heat in the slow-moving line that a place doesn't live up to the hype you created?
First off, it was super hot inside. The ceiling fans and air-conditioner weren't cutting it. I ordered the same dish (organic tofu scramble) as I had last time because I loved it so much. what i got this time was a mouthful of salt. all that boasting I did, I felt the need to finish it but I just couldn't. There was too much soy sauce on the sauteed bok choy and mushrooms. The potatoes were bland. My husband's huevos rancheritos was bland and definitely different from the last time. I know every place has its bad days so I'm not writing Lady M off yet but I might be less eager to stand in the long line next time. truly, truly, truly disappointing.
