jG0m1-899xwYY3IXpTRRCQ I probably wouldn't get anything here besides the tacos and beer (and now that I think about it, I'm not sure if they serve anything else).

I think their best tacos are the fish and potato. And despite being "home of the fish taco," don't leave without a potato taco or you'll regret it. Because, in my personal, humble, and amateur opinion, it's the best thing here. And for my non-meat eater homies out there, it's also vegetarian (bless)!

The servings are small, like street tacos, and helllllaaa loaded up. So make sure to order at least three and and pick up a handful of napkins. And a huge plus is that they have a huge selection of hot sauces.

The place is kinda divey. Their service is friendly. And their tacos are good for a decent price. Recommend this place if you're looking for a new place around campus.

Sincerely, your average college student
