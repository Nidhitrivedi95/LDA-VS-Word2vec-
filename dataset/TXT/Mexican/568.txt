-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg Over priced tacos. Did not enjoy this place at all. From the food, environment, pricing, all bad. Didn't try their drinks but it looks like that's what they are known for. So if you just wanna drink then I guess this is the place to go. If you're wanting good food at a decent price, then look somewhere else. Sorry Joyride Taco House.
