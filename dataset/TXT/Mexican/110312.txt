fwDx6uoM2SWtddARwAds2g such a bittersweet review.

the first time i went, the main server/hostess/family member of owner (?) was delightful.  offered me an Advil when i mentioned i had a headache.  it's the little things, you know?  because this set the tone for the rest of the meal and experience, it was more enjoyable.  the food was mediocre.  the menu sounds delish, but it seems everything is pre-prepared.  all restos do this to some degree, but i don't want to be able to tell.  if i'm paying a premium, i want fresh and not prepared at noon.  my biggest complaint was that the food was never hot (temperature, not spice).  

on my second visit, the same main server/hostess/family member of the owner (?) was rude, hurried, pushy and seldom around.  the food was disappointing.  i ordered a bottle of wine based on the vintage on the wine list.  she brought a different vintage but didn't say anything.  when i pointed out, she said this was all she had.  she did apply a 10% discount in the end.  

we were enjoying the bottle of wine when she offered dessert.  my partner said thank you, but not just yet.  still not done with the wine, she asked about dessert again.  he chose one but asked not to bring it until we were done with the wine.  dessert came out by a food runner 5 minutes later while we still had a third of the bottle left.  we sent it back and said we'd let them know when we were ready for it.  a couple minutes later, it came out again, by her.  my partner and i laughed at the absurdity and said, we just sent this back.  and she said, you ordered this, didn't you?  my partner, who NEVER gets upset, said, you know what, cancel it, we don't want it.  we left without even finishing the bottle of wine.

oh yeah, the "sweet" part of the bittersweet:

the resto itself is adorably quaint.  covered with images of ms. kahlo, perfect lighting for ideal ambiance, and lovely art abounds.  but alas, the digs don't make up for the rest.
