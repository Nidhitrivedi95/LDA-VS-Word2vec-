rRAKvF-E_fnikHK4WSpXrA I'm really surprised there aren't more reviews for this place. We had a great first impression just walking in the door. The staff was very nice and friendly. My boyfriend and I both got chicken burritos bad some chops with queso. Everything was very good. We will definitely be back here
