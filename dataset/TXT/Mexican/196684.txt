oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ Not impressed at all. Service was extremely slow. Not the servers fault, though. I would say that the management was at fault here. One server for an entire area, with two tables of eight, in addition to smaller parties. While we were eating a party of at least 50 trailed in. Looks like someone unloaded a bus. For a party that big, I would say that would have been a "special event" and it should have been handled in a reception area. The food was okay. Very, very pricey for tacos and chips and salsa with four drinks. The bill was $160. $14 chicken tacos, and that included nothing else...just 3 small tacos. Once again, the old "Vegas" has given way to nothing more than tourist traps. Sorry, but Macayos would have been a better option. This "nouveau" Mexican cuisine is nonsense, and is made for the young, pretentious crowd that will pay "bottle service" at ridiculous prices and go to "new cuisine" restaurants to say they've been there. If you want good chicken tacos go to Faustos. This place was a disappointment, but then again so are most tourist traps.
