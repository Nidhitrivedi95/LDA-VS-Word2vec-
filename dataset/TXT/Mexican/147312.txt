jppxrDQLXr4Nk8cV7IGlcw I went to rayna expecting great food. We were seated & was told they would bring over a drink menu. 10 minutes later & nothing. There were only 2 other tables.

I ordered a margarita no salt. My son wanted a bottle of negra modelo. My drink had salt & my son received a draft.

I ordered the cuatro mole. I thought that this would be the place to get a great mole sauce. The chicken was watery like it was cooked shredded & frozen still hot. The whole plate was cold. 

My son ordered the pescado jalapeño. It was really good. We shared his plate because I was always told that if you send your food back you don't want to eat what they bring you back. 

I might try raynas again because it could be really good if your food is served at a proper temperature.
