Cd2ERofxOeCbCi-0yDs0aw Oh, my gosh how I love this place. I've always only gotten their frybread. It's amazing. I've done sweet & savory options. They are a ton of food. Unless you have a huge appetite, I'd recommend splitting yours with someone.

They have a drive thru and service is always fast & super friendly. Most definitely go here & get some frybread. You will not regret it, well unless you eat too much. If you don't like it, you're nuts.
