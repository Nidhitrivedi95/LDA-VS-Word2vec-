It's a tiny hole in the wall place with super affordable prices and amazing delicious and authentic Mexicans food. I got the rice and bean burrito and my friend had the chicken burrito. We were both very satisfied! My burrito was by far the best and most authentic one I've had since moving back to Cleveland. The chips and salsa were fresh and both were made at the restaurant. The dining area is very small and no frills, but the staff is very attentive and kind. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in the area!
