403dr0KtTbRibcWEA7h0WA I recently moved right across the street from KETZALS, I heard wonderful things from my friends in the area and decided to bring my little sister ( Just turned 21 in Nov ) who was visiting from Colorado ! This was the first drink me and her would have had together and should have been special ! Not so much , WE had the MANAGER , throw my little sisters Colorado state DL back at her and advised us , she didnt think it was real ... Not only did she refuse us service at 5:00 in the evening with not a drip of alcohol in us ! She THREW the Lisence back to us , said they have no scans and no blacklight to verify this ...and took the CARD back to a cook to determine the validity of this ID, After i proceed to try and get the owners information I found out the other KETZALS had been closed in Desert Ridge ( Probably due to poor managment decisions ) I would NOT recommend this place to anyone with Family visiting or ... friends ! The mamagment there should go back to school and figure out how to treat customers... tell EVERYONE you know !
