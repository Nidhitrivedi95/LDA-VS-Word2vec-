Actually Qdoba is pretty close to Chipotle in taste and setup (see photos).  You get in line, tell them either Burrito or Taco, what beans, onions, guacamole, et cetera you want, and before you know it you are enjoying a flavorful meal.

I found Qdoba is trying very hard to stay relevant in a very crowded "fast casual Mexican food" segment. and seems doing a good job and business.  I came here a few weeks ago on a whim and enjoyed myself.  It was around 2 pm and they were just recovering from a busy lunch crowd.

I believe some of the pluses that standout from that visit is the diversity of the food menu and variety of choices when you are ordering.  One example is their Queso.  Yes they have it and it's as delicious as anything you can make in your microwave at home. LOL

So Four Stars and "Yay! I'm a fan."

Enjoy!
