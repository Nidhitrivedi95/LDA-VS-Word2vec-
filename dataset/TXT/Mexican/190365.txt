oDxvrLYe5SiQKdJlGhheoA Came here with my husband and young child in January 2017. The food wasn't memorable, but what I did remember was the lack of service. I had such high hopes for this place but the bad service isn't worth the cost to eat here. 

Pros:
-Close to my home
-Full bar
-Seated promptly

Cons:
-Took a long time to get our order in
-Waitress barely checked in on us, our drinks, chips and salsa
-Waitress took a really long time to bring us our check
-Waitress did not tell us that we were being charged adult menu prices for our child (She said she didn't know our small 7 year old child was ordering from the child menu, not the adult menu.) 

We will not return here.
