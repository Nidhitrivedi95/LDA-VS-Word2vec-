B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA Soho is my isshhh! I love the twin dragon ! Even when it's a set roll you can always have add on's into your roll. Don't get to wild though, it can only hold so much. 3amigos is also bomb ! If your a light eater like me you will get full on half a "burrito". Don't expect to be in & out around lunch time, this place moves fast but the demand is high so expect a line.
