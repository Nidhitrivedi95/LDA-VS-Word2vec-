hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg Walked in on a Saturday night for a few drinks with a friend after eating at another restaurant nearby. We were seated at the back bar as the place was obviously busy; all tables were full as was the bar in the front of the restaurant. 

I've eaten at this restaurant and can say that the dishes are great; the market fresh menu displayed on a chalkboard is simple, creative, and just plain tasty! 

Tonight though, we wanted cocktails and Garde Manger delivered! The service was friendly, the ambiance was buzzing, and the space itself is cozy and relaxed for a fine dining restaurant. The cocktail mixes were good and one as interesting as the next; I could have easily kept going but stopped at two 

I would definitely return for the food again, especially their seafood plates as the menu is ever changing; our bar mates servings sitting next to us definitely opened my appetite!
