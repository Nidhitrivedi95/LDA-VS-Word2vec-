-fn65iT4z-nh1Ybfyajxng We ate there last night for the first time and really enjoyed ourselves. The place is really nice inside for being in a strip mall. I had the taquitos and they were yummy. The guacamole and chips and salsa were great too.  The service was extra speedy too. We are definitely going back again soon. There were many other things I wanted to try on the menu.
