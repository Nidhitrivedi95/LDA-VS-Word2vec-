rp1TgQObnIIRZw3fHWSwJA We waited an hour and a half to eat sub-par, pricey Mexican food. I hated the taste of the tortilla. My taco was wet from the grease of the meat, so it was basically inedible. The wait staff  weren't  very helpful....only came to check on us once. The guacamole was good, just too expensive. I thought it would come with my meal free as a side, but when I got my bill they charged me for it! An extra $7 on top of the $13 taco plate. Definitely not worth the money or time....I won't be returning.
