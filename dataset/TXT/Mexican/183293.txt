nMQJ57am8aEnz1jy9Hl_3g WOW! My friends and I ate here during our stay at Excalibur.. 

Are you serious, Baja Fresh? Your burritos were amazing! I've eaten a ridiculous amount of both fancy and cheap burritos in the past... but for some reason - your burritos were just SO good!

I ordered a "Build Your Own Burrito", with Carnitas and all the works. I split a burrito with my fiance, and not only was it incredibly delicious - but I was really full off of my half! You also get some complimentary chips and salsa with your meal, so that will help fill you up as well.

My friends were just as amazed with your deliciousness, that we couldn't stop talking about it for the rest of the night. Not only that, but your service was fast and friendly too...

Good to know! If we're in your neck of the woods again next time, we'll be back!
