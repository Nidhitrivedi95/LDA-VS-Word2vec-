gdtZA3sVQ5Hk-3oPBArdLA This Zaba's is wonderful! Firstly, and very important,  the food is always fresh. I like a veggie burrito :) But what also keeps me coming back is the friendly and accommodating staff. Not once, have I had a poor experience with staff. I think that speaks to managements training.
