Burrito Boyz is one of the go-to places for lunch, dinner, or even a bite after a night on the town.  Good thing is they're open til pretty late too - bonus!

I've tried a few things on their menu, from your standard Chicken and/or Steak burritoes to their quesadillas, all of which are great choices.

The place is mainly for takeout though, there are a few tables but not enough to sit large groups.  If you go in with 3-4 people, you'll be fine, at least for this location.

Walk to the cash and make your order, they're efficient.  You'll be in and out in 10 minutes tops, note that they're usually BUSY!  You get a receipt with a number on it, they'll call it and you get to choose what toppings you want, type of beans, and level of spiciness.  Their spice levels are off the charts!  I usually just end up with mild,I go for medium when I feel adventurous.  Anything more, and I'll probably regret it later..

On to the actual food!
Their burritos are giant, stuffed, they load the toppings and the meat inside the thing.  It's crazy, and ends up being a mess whenever I eat it.  I tried it multiple times, there's no way to neatly eat one of these things.  Mind you, it's a hell of a ride, the burrito is really good.  Loads of flavour exploding in your mouth with every bite.  It's saucy and not dry.  Vegetables make it crunchy and you'll most likely be stuffed after eating it.  Thumbs up!
