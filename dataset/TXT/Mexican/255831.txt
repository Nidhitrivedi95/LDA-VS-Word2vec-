veXxt8rGY_RJPpA5QkHT9Q This place is way larger than it looks! Even though it was very crowded, we ordered drinks at the bar and only had to wait around 40 minutes or so. The waiter was average; he was kind of absent-minded and forgot a few things, but all the other people that dropped off chips were really helpful and friendly. The bartender was fast and efficient, and the draft list is extensive. 

I went with the chef recommendations and tried the Taco with a soft shell AND hard shell. It was fantastic! I was impressed by the texture and all the different flavors combining into this tasty taco. It wasn't spicy either, which is perfect for me because I can't handle spice at all. Love this new location! I'll definitely be back.
