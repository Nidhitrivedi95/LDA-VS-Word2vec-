xlXwxfiUD4bgJFKUYwkzOg Borracha is so good.  It is my go to place when I have family and friends in town.  I love the happy hour.  The street tacos and roasted corn salad are my favorite. I feel like I am eating a little healthy. The dinner menu is wonderful.  A lot of different and unique items. Margaritas are really good and not to sweet. Wonderful staff.  Last night Hayley was our server.  She is the best!!  Friendly, fast and so knowledgeable of menu items.  The manager Zach was going around to the tables to make sure all the quests were happy.  So cool.  Try it, you will not be disappointed.
