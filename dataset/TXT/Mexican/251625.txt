UOK4ARjGtOtfYZSIm57ROw Well I walked it all cheery and happy to pick up my food and bring it home to devour.
Well as I walk in 2 people are standing at the bar and I hear them use an expletive to describe me...mind you I'm 9 months pregnant. 

I was irate and asked them why they said that. The guy said it wasn't him it was he co worker ...anyhow I told them how I felt and vowed to never return and I ask you to also not eat there. Nothing worse than men calling a customer names. I can't help that I have a huge belly you bastards in brewing 2 humans what have you 2 done lately???

Disgusting.
