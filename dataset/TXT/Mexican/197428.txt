Their margaritas are pretty good. I must say I've tried at of them and they make flavored tortillas in house, and the flavor varies from day to day. I must say I've had them all. The old town tacos are fair enough for the beginner; including shrimp, beef, and chicken fajita. I like the Spanish rice here. But mostly I love their tortillas. It's a fun place to come and sit, nice patio and night when you're not dying from the heat. Good for a date night or after work drinks. Come check it out!!
