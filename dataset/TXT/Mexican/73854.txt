cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A I was looking for dinner and decided to come here due to the raving reviews. So it appears you come in, fill out some paperwork on what you'd like to order, pay, take a seat, and they will bring you your order. The paperwork appears complicated if its your first time but they are very friendly and will walk you through it. You can even sample some of the chicken if you have trouble deciding. 

You can order a one meat combo or a two meat combo. I opted for the jerk chicken with jerk fried rice. I thought the chicken was flavored very well and has a nice kick. I expected a little more from the rice, but it was still tasty nonetheless. My husband ordered the two meat combo with the jade red chicken and emerald chicken. While the jade red chicken apparently is their most popular item, I did not care for it as it tasted like any other sweet and sour fried chicken from a Chinese fast food restaurant. I thought the emerald chicken was great but then again I've always enjoyed ginger scallion sauce on anything. Of the three, I liked the jerk chicken best but it can be because I'm more exposed to the other two flavors due to my Chinese background and therefore find them a tad less exciting.

Overall, I find the food here to be pretty good and the prices are very fair. Great service. And oh, complimentary cookie with each combo ordered - soo delicious!
