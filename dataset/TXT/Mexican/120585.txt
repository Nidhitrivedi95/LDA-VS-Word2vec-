H-B_JoResY4PyXND1_DQfg Big Azz! Yes, you know it!!! The margaritas here a devastatingly tasty and you can't go wrong with 22oz of frozen strawberry (or raspberry, mango, kiwi, original etc) from 10-12pm or the happy hours after a day in the office. I have been going to mad mex for years. I am a huge fan of the lunch specials (burritos) and find their tortilla soup really good. I would not classify Mad Mex as 'authentic' mexican (check out the place Carnegie for that) but mad mex is near and dear to my heart with some truly tasty choices. Another yelper comment about the different locations which is very true. The Oakland Mex (near University of PGH) is small and crowed, this one is usually laid back with a nice draft selection. The one out in Robinson Twp has a great draft selection and probably the biggest of all. Try the carnitas burrito or the fajitas (my go-to choices).
