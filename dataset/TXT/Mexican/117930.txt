GPJAacvrxZpbJvJiYvWitQ This happens to be one of my favorite taco bells in the area! The customer service is always top-notch and it even emits a sort of family feeling every time i go inside. The area is not to great but i do enjoy how the store is maintained; heck even the trees outside are well kept, and they look like bells! Now let me tell you why I enjoy this Taco Bell more then others. It typically is not to busy there so it lets you have some privacy and due to the not-so-much-business (unfortunately and not so at the same time) it makes my orders taste really fresh! Every time I go there I usually get 2 beefy 5 layers and i will get them grilled, and so far they are the best at grilling them out of any other Taco Bell that i have been to. Unfortunately the reason i have to give 4 instead of a 5 is for 1, that the drive-thru doesn't work to well, which isn't the employees fault, however it does deter me to go there when I'm trying to be quick, and 2 sometimes it's not the cleanest, but that was probably because some people had just left when i got there. Besides those things this one of my favorite Taco Bells to go to.
