OMEbwr0Aybw_wnqvno-6zQ I went here with two friends for a late lunch. It was super! I had a cheese chile relleno and a veggie enchilada.  The chile relleno was phenomenal, the best I have had ever. The jalapeno cream sauce is the one to pick hands down! I asked about it and the waiter brought me some to try.  They had free queso the day we went. James D was our server and he was very attentive and made us feel like we were esteemed guests in his home.  Great representative of Chuy's.  I will def return!
