gOBxVkHpqtjRRxHBIrpnMA I'm actually pretty surprised by how sporadic the reviews are for Chipotle.

I've had nothing but great experiences with them... although there is a bit of a "premium" price going against entrenched Toronto burrito franchises like Burrito Boyz, I've never ever been disappointed with Chipotle.

Their portions always hit the spot.  I find their quality to be top notch and always consistent, just like how I pick up a chicken burrito every single time I visit.

Furthermore, their inclusions of Tabasco sauce and fresh lemon wedges is a plus.. it's just one of those little extras that I would pay for.

Finally, serving beer, especially from local micro-brewery Mill St. is just icing on the cake.

I love this place and as a self-appoited "burrito connoisseur" of Toronto.. this place deserves 4 stars!
