oxv2UyI5yF6yawPU20tOxA I was hesitant since the ratings were low, but my friend really wanted to try it.  I was surprisingly impressed.  We started with the chicken nachos - yummy and filling!  The we split the fuego and added shrimp.  Very large portions.  I loved the roasted red pepper tortillas with sage butter!  overall great experience, including the selection of margaritas!
