R6cWq0FkVfV_Ee-YttlPyA I don't understand the plethora of negative reviews of this place.  Stopped here for a quick bite before a flight.  The chicken quesadilla I ordered was cooked fresh to order.  It was served with 2 sides of salsa that were clearly homemade and quite good.  I would gladly stop here again, ignore the negative reviews.
