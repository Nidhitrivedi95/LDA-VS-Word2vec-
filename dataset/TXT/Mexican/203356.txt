pomGBqfbxcqPv14c3XH-ZQ The ambiance is probably my favorite aspect of Leticia's. This place has been on my radar for awhile but I simply don't find myself in this area of town very often. It's located on a cool little street that I didn't know existed. It has a nice atmosphere and I bet it would be a neat place to take a stroll at night. 

The service was just average, even a bit slow at times. Nice enough but it took longer than expected for condiments and few other items to show up at our table after the food arrived. I had the empanada lunch special with grilled shrimp. At $9 it was a reasonable portion, served with rice and beans. It was crazy heavy on the onions. I like onion for sure, but I couldn't taste anything else. The onion overwhelmed all the other flavors in the dish. Rice and beans were pretty standard, nothing to brag about. 

I also tried the shrimp a la diabla. It was much better than my own meal. Nice and spicy with a good amount of tiger prawns. I didn't try a margarita, perhaps it's the star of the show? With all the good reviews and the cool atmosphere I'll come back next time I'm in the area. I'd like to try the happy hour or dinner and have a few other menu items. This spot seems to have lots of potential. I just won't do the empanada on my next go.
