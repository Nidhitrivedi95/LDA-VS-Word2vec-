F-PmkzyN80fVcNMN8Z2aiw We have eaten at this location (Tatum & Shea) for years, but were really stunned today at how bad the food was!  The menu recently changed and we were excited to try some new items at brunch.  As soon as my biscuits & gravy arrived it smelled like seafood; turns out it was the grease? used to cook the scrambled eggs.  The biscuits & gravy were ok, but could not eat the eggs or the sausage links.  Muffins which used to be good were now awful.  Had ONE blueberry in my muffin and it was a bland white mix muffin.  Not sure what happened here, like did management change along with menu?  But beware, the brunch has gone seriously downhill.  I doubt we will ever try it again.
