9wCP-MP2B1Yi7EzsM0H0ew I was just in Mexico City, Mexico and tried al pastor tacos that are slow roasted for hours on a spit called a trompo. Since I've been back in Charlotte I have searched for these style of tacos and have finally found an awesome comparison!! Tacos el Regio doesn't disappoint. You have to try the Trompo tacos! That is the reason to go here!! The other food is great as well but the tromp tacos will change your life.
