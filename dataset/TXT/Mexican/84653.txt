d8lmIZIqmBC9oPM8y1dc7Q After living in Texas for five years, I'm extremely picky about Tex Mex. This place is LEGIT. It's the closest thing to real Tex Mex I've found in the Carolinas. It's the only place I've found here that has charro beans. The tacos are outstanding and I love the cheese enchiladas. I highly recommend it. It's one of my favorite restaurants of any kind in Charlotte!
