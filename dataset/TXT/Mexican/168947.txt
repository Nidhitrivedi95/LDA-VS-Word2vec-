lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw Husband and I came out for AYCE tacos, tequila, and margaritas.  They offer 3 types of tacos with the promotion: chicken, steak, and/or pork. All are delicious. All you can drink margaritas and tequila. If you get the opportunity, ask to sit outside. The views are absolutely gorgeous. The staff does an amazing job making sure you're taken care of. This will remain on our things to do when in Vegas! Taco Tuesday all the way!
