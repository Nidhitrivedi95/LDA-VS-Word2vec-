Y_9f9tzVRaXjfT9Fa5_W9A Tried it today for the first time. Not at all impressed! The food was cold. Who does cold nachos!!? Will never be back. This location is dirty with a bunch of kids working there. Get to work, and clean the glass it's filthy! The floor was dirty. Everyone besides the cooks were just  standing around socializing. I even overheard the guy at the register drop a F* bomb.
