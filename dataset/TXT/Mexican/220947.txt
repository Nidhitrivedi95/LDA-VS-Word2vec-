rjlAUHT8B6KhKAmkZqS1xw I'm soooo beyond thrilled that this spot is finally open! I've been anxiously awaiting the opening and was so please with our first visit! 

The staff is super friendly and upbeat and the food was fabulous!! It's a little pricey but honestly in the long run it's well worth it!! 

The cocktail list is AWESOME and you can tell the bar manager put some love into it! Another aspect of this place that didn't disappoint was the salsa tray! Who doesn't love getting to try a variety of delicious salsas with fresh homemade chips! 

Do yourself a favor and check this place out!
