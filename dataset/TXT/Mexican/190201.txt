oDxvrLYe5SiQKdJlGhheoA The service was excellent, as was the guacamole! I had the shrimp quesadilla which was so good and my husband had the shrimp enchilada's which he really liked a lot. Our compliments went to the chef. The atmosphere was a bar atmosphere. I had a virgin margarita which was just ok and my spouse had 2 regular margaritas which he felt were weak and had a soapy taste...but he had 2 so I guess they weren't that bad. Bottom line - food & service were excellent, atmosphere and drinks just so so. We did use the $5 coupon with absolutely no problem. Dinner was $48 + tip. I would absolutely return!
