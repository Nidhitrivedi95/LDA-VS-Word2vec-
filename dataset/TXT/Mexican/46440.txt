7rpa12_EX3A-hyGtrv8o3A Nice patio on a sunny weekday evening ! Place was empty when we got here (mind you it was very early for dinner - 6'ish. We ordered frozen margarita's since they were only $5 and they were soooooo yummy....so nice we had a couple. 

The chips and salsa were nice with our drinks, they should of replenished though.

The menu had many items that sounded amazing and very authentic ! Ordered fish tacos and chicken enchiladas and a side of guacamole. All was very nice but came to $63 before tip and seems a little overpriced for what we had, but all in all it was nice and even had a doggy bag for lunch the next day - Ha Ha  compared to the only other Mexican restaurant down the street - 1,000 times better. Fresh and very delicious ! 

Waiter was a little slow - we could have ordered more drinks.....but he was getting busy so - all good ! 

Will certainly return to try a couple other items that sounded amazing but would be an option for a cold winter day !
