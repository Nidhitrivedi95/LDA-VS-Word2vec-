iOt7ebp4Zy-5YUjHL1rbmQ Honestly, wanted to love it!  So many neighbors raved about it coming, so we were excited, It's in my backyard.  We have gone twice, and both times it was ok to bad.  Chips are STALE.  Pork, cheese quesadilla was ok, some gristle, very greasy.  Bean cheese burrito? How can you ruin that you ask?  Well at Backyard taco, the beans are Soupy texture, impossible to eat, unless with a spoon, and NO cheese. 
Taste of beans was super BLAND. NEVER again.  Drive up service is a little slow. Only positive is the staff is super friendly.
