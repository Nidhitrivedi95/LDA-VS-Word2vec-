FdNdV2IZQnRlHyDicfVnMw Fast service, fake margaritas, Americanized Mexican... great at what it is.

Don't go looking for a deep mole... or tortillas pressed table side.

They take coupons from their competition... have daily specials... different ones of lunch and for dinner.... and are really fast with service.

We have been there twice.  It was packed both times... once on a weeknight and the other on Friday night... 

Beans and rice are nothing special... burittos are large and 2 meals worth.

Fajitas come with a "15 min to make" warning but come much faster.  They only come with 3 tortillas which left over 3 cups of meat and veggies to take home.

Margaritas are not from scratch... no idea what the other flavors look like... the only one I saw both times was plain lime... and when I ordered a half pitcher the waiter didn't ask what flavor... even though there is a card on the table from a commercial mix / distributor hinting that there are fruity options.

The cheesecake isn't really much cheesecake... it's 4 small bites covered in chocolate and hidden in whipped cream arranged around a "fried ice cream" ball that is coated in soggy corn flakes.

It is right around the corner from us... and there are piles of coupons that come in the mail for places farther away... so we will return when we aren't in the mood for the long drive to better places.
