vMKQaR8bI2saI7rz8H5MYg Sabor is one of my favorite fast casual places. The contents of the tacos, and bowls are so fresh! I love that they offer corn tortillas, or flour. Personally i like the corn tortilla (Authenticos), but that is just me. They build your own bowl is also pretty sweet, as the cashier will swing their computer screen around to allow you to choose the contents yourself. A minor detail that I appreciate tremendously especially when the line is out the door. Grab a Colombiana soda for a change with your meal! Great atmosphere, great workers!
