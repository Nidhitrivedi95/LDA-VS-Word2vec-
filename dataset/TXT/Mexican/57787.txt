a9aW5e731lplWGHUZ02-zQ My second burrito ever and therefore the jury is still out while I sample the various places. This place scored a few points for its selections such as noodles or rice, and I like that they only have one size and a limited selection, not to varied and more focused.

Hard to find busy little place, has lots of character.  I would go back again for sure but looking forward to trying more places.
