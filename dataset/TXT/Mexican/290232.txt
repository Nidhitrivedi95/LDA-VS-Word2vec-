Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ This was probably the best brunch I've ever had. I ordered the blackberry waffles - they were phenomenal. I made myself finish them even after getting full because they were just so good. I also ordered the organic coffee (French press) and it was lovely. I was actually given my own French press of coffee.

My husband got he bananas foster French toast and loved it. Everyone in our group loves their good. I would highly recommend it.
