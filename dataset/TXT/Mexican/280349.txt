xWq3LQw8w4OIK-fSiGwNLg Great food and an amazing selection. I had wings, some of the best I have had in town. My wife had a cheesesteak and it was very good. The kids had a burrito and burger. My son said it was one of the best burgers he ever had. Fat boy is a family owned and run restaurant. The owner prepares the food with help of his sons and everyone was very friendly.
