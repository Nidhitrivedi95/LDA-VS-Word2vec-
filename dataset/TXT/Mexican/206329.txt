pzy9xWQqsDxVU6j9MktRJg I love Azteca!  My family has been eating here for over 10 years.  The food and service is excellent. Some could consider this to be Tex-Mex but it is more authentic Mexican food with local favorites like Arroz Con Pollo.  If you're searching for good Mexican food, look no further!  I highly recommend this restaurant and specifically the Woodlawn location for the authenticity.
