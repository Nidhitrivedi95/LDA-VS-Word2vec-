plHKBwA18aWeP-TG8DC96Q Started out with the drink special of the day, sangria. It arrived with lots of ice and was quite literally tasteless here. What was worse is we were charged $10 for them. Water in glasses on table with no ice. Not a portent of what's to come. 
Thankfully, the food was delicious. Mac & cheese, corn & broccolini, check. Brisket & burnt ends, mustard & coffee bbq sauces check. Service check. 
Donuts were the dessert special. Strawberry/Meyer lemon glaze & a marscapone concoction were so sugary sweet that one could not taste the donut at all. These were $3 & $5. Approximately $75.00 for two, with major negative of CASH ONLY. Go for the food and maybe a beer. Ditch the cocktail and dessert.
