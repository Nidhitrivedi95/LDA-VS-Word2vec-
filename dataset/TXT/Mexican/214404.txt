QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA These were the best nachos I've ever had! I swear they were made fresh to order and the spice was on point. We went here based on the name because it made us laugh. We definitely chose smartly because the food was great and the drinks were even better! I had the lobster crab nachos. People say share them, but I finished them all myself! muahahaha
