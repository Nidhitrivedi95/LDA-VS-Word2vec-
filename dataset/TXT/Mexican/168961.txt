lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw I come here for an awesome atmosphere, strong drinks and tasty filler food. Chips, guacamole and salsa are bomb so everything else obviously match. I know there are gripes about the pricing, but calm down people, you're in a bar front casino with waterfalls, awesome decor and great service. If you need to focus on the food, you're best visiting the sketchy part of town or a food truck. I need to come back here for their legendary Taco Tuesday experience.  That'll be a good way to jump start the week.
