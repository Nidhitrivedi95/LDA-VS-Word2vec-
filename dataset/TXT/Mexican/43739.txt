7JQ5SNrrlCfkghYFzhOVUw If you want Amercanized Mexican food this is not the place for you. This place is authentic Mexican food, and it is delicious. I like to get the Theresa's Special which is super spicy and amazing. Wednesdays they have all you can eat beef tacos and cheese enchiladas which are both good, but very very filling.  I highly recommend that if you like Mexican food that you eat here, it is awesome.
