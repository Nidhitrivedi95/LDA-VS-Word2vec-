lnJlOuHGNRoN2zW_a6Vb7g My husband and I checked this place out shortly after it opened and we were pleasantly surprised! 

Good:
- drinks. great beer menu and really amazing cocktails
- food is creative and we enjoyed the sushi order style of the tacos
- the open concept is great
- music was on point when we went

Bad:
- it's a little awkward of a location due to being right off Indian School
- due to the location being right across from a neighborhood, they have to close at 10pm due to noise ordinance which is a bit of a bummer, because everytime we've been here it's still pretty busy at 10pm and its a fun place to pitstop on the way home from a later dinner for the drinks

Overall, definitely a great place for happy hour or post-dinner drinks!
