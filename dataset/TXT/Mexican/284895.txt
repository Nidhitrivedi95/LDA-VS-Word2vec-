y1VInN5m3RbHU59kiQbmxA Stopped by on a fluke. Was actually going elsewhere when driving by I mentioned to my son had always wanted to try this place. I'm so glad we did. Tortilla soup, ceviche were delicious & flavorful. I had the filet mignon along with the rice & beans. I don't find many places that can make black beans that good, if any, however the chef here has mastered it. My filet was smothered in poblano which I love. Tender & flavorful. Our waiter was engaging, helpful & knowledgeable about the food & drink - what a breath of fresh air. The decor is cozy, beautiful & eclectic. Fresh flowers & white table cloth on the tables give that extra little touch of elegance. I thoroughly enjoyed the evening. Will be back... with guests. Thank you so much for a memorable evening - not just a meal.
