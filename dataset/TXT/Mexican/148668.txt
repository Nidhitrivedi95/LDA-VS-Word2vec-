jScBTQtdAt-8RshaiBEHgw I have two things to say about this restaurant - Pork Belly Eggs Benedict and bread pudding french toast.  So delicious.... we have to share.  

We've only strayed once to order the apple pancakes that are also a masterpiece.  Some day I want to try the Short Rib Eggs Benedict, but it is hard to pass on my first two choices, because they are so yummy and I dream about them.  They have a bread pudding corn beef hash dish that sounds very interesting also.  All the food looks good.  They also have some Filipino favorites as well if you are into that.  There is something for everyone.

The staff is friendly and eager to please, the chef has come to our table every time we have been there...a very nice touch.

This place is a hidden (literally) gem, in the back of the parking lot on the corner of Horizon and Valle Verde.  The location means not everyone has discovered it yet so it is not crowded....yet.  If you love great food, that is unusual you will love this place.
