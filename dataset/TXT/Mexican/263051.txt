w34pLtetsY3TkkPJQdLOVg UPDATE 9/20 - CLOSED!!!!!!

Went here for a date night at 5pm on Saturday (left the toddler with a sitter).  We came because we got the Groupon and wanted to support a local business and live nearby.  The place was empty the entire time we were there 5-6:30 Saturday.  My husband mentioned that the bored staff was staring at us a lot (I was sitting with my back to them so I didn't see).

We were told right away that they would not accept the Groupon because Groupon hadn't paid them yet and they couldn't pay their food suppliers and this is a business blah blah blah so unprofessional to tell us their restaurant woes.  Owner told us we could use the Groupon later or get a refund from Groupon.  What an awkward way to start a date night with not honoring a Groupon.  Why pass on your stress and dilemmas to your customers/guests?!!? - it ruins the VIBE and experience of dining there.

We decided to stay (we were on the clock with the sitter and didn't have a plan B).  

We got the agua frescas after being offered samples which was nice.  They were good and refreshing but I thought the fruity sweetness clashed with the rest of the meal.

We got the appetizer recommended by our server, chips and 3 salsas, 1 torta and 2 street tacos.  They tortas are big IMP and the street tacos small.  I thought the tortas had too much bread - I ate mine without the top piece of bread so I could actually taste the meat (pork).
