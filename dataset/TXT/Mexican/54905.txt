9vub2LM7Djy8P-LPumcLXA The other reviews are accurate!! This place is delish! I tried 3 tacos, pastor, asada, and carnitas. They were all so good! Meat was tender and juicy! This place offers higher quality street tacos for taco stand prices! The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly! Try it!
