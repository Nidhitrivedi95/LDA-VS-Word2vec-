za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw Horrible...a tourist trap in Old Scottsdale with poor food and even poorer service.  Only recommend to your enemies...ordered eggs with pancakes and hash browns and bacon.  Eggs came cold and powder like, pancakes were not consistent in taste or size, the hash browns are more like thick French fries and the bacon was exceptionally salty.  One of the worse quality meals for $7+, and the slow service and being ignored during the meal - even not being asked for more coffee or anything else.  Any Denny's next time if you are desperate on Xmas with not many places open.  Scottsdale is a wonderful town there are so many other choices - do not waste your $$ here
