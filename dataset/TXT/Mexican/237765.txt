SxS_XL_yi9c004nXvBuSjA I am not one to complain at all and I am usually a very polite customer. However, this Chipotle Mexican Grill is so awful with the most horrible customer service that I could give it less than a star and no stars at all, I could! I had to call and order and I was told they do not accept orders over the phone. They only accept orders placed online. Not everyone has access to the Internet! What kind of idiotic thing is that for customer service?! How could you not accept phone orders? This isn't grubhub or Uber where you only do things online from a smartphone. I am disgusted by the customer service at this location and the owner needs to do something about this! These lazy people don't want to work or help out a customer. They act like they don't care. When I asked if I could still call back to ask a question about an order status, the guy on the phone seriously said: "You don't have to. It tells you online." It's implying that they don't want to be bothered. Please don't go here if you expect customer service and professionalism! Absolutely pathetic how they deal with customers and I am very disappointed.
