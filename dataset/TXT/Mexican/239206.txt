T0dN9-NfwF_YD2fSQRu9AQ I really wanted to like this place but it didn't follow through on several levels. 

Being a vegan,  it seemed like there weren't a ton of options. They had run out of vegan pancake batter (really, on a Saturday morning?) so I got the squash soup and split the pakoras with my dining companions. 

The pakoras were ok; I couldn't really taste any veggies in them but the chutney trio was tasty.

Our waitress seemed to have forgotten about my soup and needed to be reminded about it. When I did get the soup,  it was ok. It really only had one flavor. I also tasted my boyfriend's bean burrito; it was incredibly bland. I have no idea how they could make beans and rice so tasteless. 

After all this, our total was $33. If the meal had been impressive I wouldn't complain about the price. But for poor service and bland food I was very disappointed.

We won't be back.
