-uRn5Hf1uo4vf3UTtOvIfA After being stuck in the strip for what felt like eternity  this morning after bringing in the new year, all I wanted were some tacos. I js moved here and wasn't sure on where to go, but this place was the closest thing to me still open. Didn't expect the greatest since it was 4 am ..but he cooked my Carne asada tacos right there in my face. They were fresh and delicious  and has been all I've been thinking about since. I believe I found my go-to spot.
