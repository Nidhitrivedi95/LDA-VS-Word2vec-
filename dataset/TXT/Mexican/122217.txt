hDlDKfFpUCW47lifcGZSNg The good and bad review! 
1st time here. Went inside to order, several tables filled with families. Appeared to be very clean with a salsa bar next to the soda machine. 
Welcomed by the gal at the counter to take my order. Order 2 shredded beef tacos with no tomatoes with rice, no beans. She read back my order, I paid and had a seat till ready. I chose take out as I was by myself. My total was $8 and some change. 

1st mistake, I drove away and didn't check my order. Ugh!!! Tacos look great with no tomatoes, but ALL flipped beans!!!! Yucky!!!  So $8 to two tacos was way overpriced and disappointing. The tacos were great. Will try again and will definitely verify my order before leaving.
