7xmuQuhpzBlkkSbWePFeVQ My pregnant friend was craving some Mexican, and what mama wants, mama gets.  Unfortunately for mama, Momocho doesn't serve lunch so we found Orale!  and her bad luck continued.  I read the reviews and it sounded great.  Maybe the reviews were written after too many mojitos because I do not understand the hype or 4 star rating.  First of all, our waitress was sitting on the floor washing windows in the small doorway when we came in.  She was not very friendly throughout the lunch.  Also, she was pretty much a moron.  We were the only 2 customers in the restaurant THE ENTIRE VISIT-- WHICH WAS AT NOON!!!!   She came back twice to clarify our orders. The salsas were disgusting.  The first was the flavor of tomato sauce and the other, which was a fresh salsa, was so not fresh the tomatoes looked water logged and pickled.  We ordered the tortilla soup, after reading someone yelp that it was the best they ever had.  It was not good.  My friend wouldn't eat it and had it taken off the bill.  It was basically bland tomato soup.  Maybe if there were some hot sauce on the table it could have been jazzed up a bit.  There are only about 5 lunch options.  I opted for the raved about chorizo and black bean quesadilla with goat cheese.  It was just a little off. I think it was the choice of cheese....Either way, we left hungry.  The portions are small.  There are no options for sides, and lunch cost $28.  I had the quesadilla with soup and water, my friend had iced tea and a kids quesadilla and my son had a kids quesadilla.  The much better option would be Ohio City Burrito next door.  That place was jam packed.  I guess we figured out why we were the only ones there.  Heads up- there are only about 5 tables and the day we went the speaker was BLASTING music right above us.  I will not be going back; neither will mama.
