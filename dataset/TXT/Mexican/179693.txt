N-EA6G39XHc1RqF-4jAABg Food was really subpar. I had the enchiladas and it was literally TOUGH to eat. The enchiladas were drier than the Sonoran desert and I probably would have had an easier time trying to cut through an armadillo shell. My companions opted for the fajitas, and while their experience was better than mine, they still noted that it was subpar at best.

The only highlight of the meal was the dessert - the taco caramelized banana was neat.

It's a massive restaurant and it was pretty much dead empty on a Wednesday night, so maybe that had something to do with the food quality. Service was quite pleasant at least.
