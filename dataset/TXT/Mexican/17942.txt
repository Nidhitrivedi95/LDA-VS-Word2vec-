1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ Went in for my first visit for lunch one day, and now I'm hooked! The service was fantastic! Made sure I had samples of the meat before I ordered since I wasn't familiar with their food. So patient and helpful as I was trying to understand the menu. The food was so fresh and flavorful! Amazing food! Cannot wait to bring my family and our friends there!
