e13SEvJud_vgeDR_doL4sQ Vegan Menu is awesome!!  Thank you Hussong's Cantina!!!
You gave us an excellent time where we can eat worry free for eating cruelty free.  The Margarita menu looked awesome but we did not try it, we know it was a big mistake lol. 

We shared the Chilaquiles plate with tofu egg and the Enchiladas with Beef-less tips from the Vegan menu. I am very crucial when it come to fake cheeses but the way everything was put together it blended in nicely. The salsas were great, 4 salsas: 1 pineapple, regular tomato, mango and I believe they're spicy one was and habanero salsa that was less runny probably made with some Olive oil, all salsa were good. 

The last part that made this Hussong's great was a trio of live musicians. They were a great touch of humor, class and talent. They played beautifully songs in English and Spanish of any Genre. They made the ambiance fun and were on point with any rendition they played.  From Johnny Cash to Vicente Fernandez to even Beyonce and LMFAO, they played it all and had fun doing it. 

Our experience was so great we will be back to eat here when we are in Las Vegas.
