Ouh38adC9WbCRSSyYGtL3Q My friend and I were headed to another restaurant close by when we stopped to look at the menu in the window. The hostess came outside and handed us two menus. It all looked good, so we changed plans and decided to dine at Margaritas.

This is a fairly small restaurant with about a dozen tables for four on one side of the room. There is also a bar , which I think seats six.

We asked for recommendations since we had never been here before. A few items were mentioned, but he said the Chile relleno was "killer." We both ordered it and thought it was the best relleno we ever had. Came with rice and choice of beans. Everything was tasty. Would we come back? You bet!

If you're going on the weekend, I would call and make a res. The place was packed, including the bar area.
