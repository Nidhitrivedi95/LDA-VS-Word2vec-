2Sn5VxuA4-TTUbbshZ5kDg We come here too often due to my fiance loving there food and being the closest to our house. While i dont mind chipotle, this location is awful. The parking is hit or miss and you sometimes have to valet your car just to get dinner to go. Also for some reason half of lyndhurst seems to have the same idea as we do and we all end up there at the same time. Cant tell you that in the multiple times ive been here that we did not have atleast a 20 minute wait before we could order.. On the bright side we havent gotten sick from this location so thats a good thing i guess.
