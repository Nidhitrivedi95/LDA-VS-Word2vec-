My husband loved the tamales, Cuban style seasoned steak, rice & black beans& plantain bananas  "Maduros". We shared croquetas de jamon as appetizers. I had lechon asado, mariquitas and yuca with mojo, avocado salad. It was all delicious. Great service. The hostess was sweet and immediately welcomed us and took care of us, our table was cozy and very romantic spot. Our captain and waiter were there to explain the specials, and with basket of bread in hands. Didn't have to ask for anything. The staff anticipated our desires. Very well trained staff. Loved everything. Thank you very very much for another unforgettable evening!!!!
