I had the pleasure of trying some of their menu items while sitting at their back patio on a gorgeous Saturday afternoon. The manager recommended a couple of their best-selling items, which were the Candied Jalapeno Bacon and the Baja Fish Taco. I ended up loving both of those items! The Candied Jalapeno Bacon has a spicy kick to it, but is still manageable for people who usually avoid spicy food. I thought the Baja Fish Taco was absolutely delicious. It has a great combination of flavours that melts into your mouth. The other taco I tried was the Tacos al Pastor. I say to pass on these. The pork was not very tender and the pineapple did not make for a great combination.

I ordered one of their margaritas, the Guadalupe. It was alright, I wasn't completely wowed by the drink as it was a bit more sour than sweet. I did try the Horchata for the first time and loved it. It's non-alcoholic as well! It's a light and naturally sweet drink. I learnt that people would drink horchatas to clean their palate while eating. I highly recommend drinking this if you order some spicy food!

Fonda Lola has a great array of food, which some are hits and others are misses. The downfall is probably their price point. The portions are smaller and best if you want to eat something light to share but don't mind spending a little bit more on.
