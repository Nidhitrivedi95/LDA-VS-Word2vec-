xIYTia1c4IUFxIQlBItasA We were all very excited when a mexican restaurant was opening in Mount Horeb and this place does not dissappoint.  Everything I have sampled on the menu has been excellent.  The service is quick and very friendly, I have always been seated quickly and they are always righ on top of bringing chips and taking drink orders immediately.  They get busy in the evenings, which is a good sign, but I recommend going at non peak lunch hours. Very reasonable prices, and large portions.
