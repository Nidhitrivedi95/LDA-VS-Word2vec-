v0FdDAXvEYieRWcngbCe1Q I have been here twice now. First time I had the enchiladas. Taste was alright but the were barely warm and tortillas were raw but for fast Mexican food it was decent. Went back a second time and this time I  had a steak burrito. Once again the temp of the food is borderline cold. The kick though is that for a steak burrito and drink with no side other than sour cream and guacamole will cost you $16 and some change. I will never go back for this sub par food. If it was priced better you could justify the semi warm mediocre food. I recommend you try other places.
