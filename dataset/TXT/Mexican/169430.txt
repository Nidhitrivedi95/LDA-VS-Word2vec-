lWmDrnqgU6w3gFaJyn_1Uw Visited this restaurant for the first time with my girlfriend due to friend recommendation. And I have to say, it does live up to the hype. 

Since it was early in the morning on a weekend, we liked to start out our meal with some nice coffee. Not gonna lie, if you are looking to some authentic Mexican coffee, save it. Their coffee was not their highlight. 

They offered two specials that day: an omelette and a stuffed chili pepper. We listened to our friendly waiter's recommendation and ordered one of each. 

Their baked potatoes that accompanied the core of the meals were phenomenal! The temperature was perfectly controlled and all the pieces of the potatoes were cooked evenly, and just right. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, with just the right amount of salt to make it appeal to the tongues. 

It is very hard for me to describe the main courses in details, since there was a lot going on, but just know that food is served in a timely fashion, and the impact of the flavors truly made the visit an overall enjoyable experience. Definitely keep a lookout on the specials if you want something more memorable. 

 The restaurant itself is very clean, and was decorated with interesting Hispanic things that created an unique atmosphere that made it ideal for 1 on 1 dining. Definitely would return to this place next time I am in town.
