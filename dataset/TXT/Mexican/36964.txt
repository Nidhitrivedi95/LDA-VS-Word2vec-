5O02gK9VpnLZNC-aFnp6lQ Been meaning to try this place out due to some friends posts. Finally! I remembered and tried this place. I was starving when I went and wanted to order everything. I got menudo which was just ok. It was kinda greasy and bland. I've had better menudo. I didn't finish it cause my tummy and grease don't do well. I also got the ceviche pescado which was so flippin' good!! Only ate about half due to finishing off the chips and salsa and the fact that they give you so much. The ceviche is so fresh and packed full of flavor. Can't wait to go back and try more seafood items.
