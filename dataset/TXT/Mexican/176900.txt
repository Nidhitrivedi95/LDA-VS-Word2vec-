MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA Every time Brad and I plan a trip to Toronto, we ask for recommendations of where to eat. Every time, someone tells us Grand Electric. I'm so glad we went!

The menu was quite simple. Brad ordered a chicken taco and 2 pork tacos (I think cheek and belly, but don't quote me on that) and he ordered a drink, but again I don't remember what he got. I ordered the Baja fish taco, crispy cauliflower, and a margarita. We both split the Ticka Tostada.

The tacos were great! Though I only had 2, I thought the Baja fish was one of the best I've ever had! The cauliflower was good, and I would still get it again. Brad loved his tacos, but found it odd they don't ask "hot, medium or mild" when ordering. I think it's because they gave you so many hot sauces on the side. The Tostada was great as well! Though, I thought a bit spicy.

The greatest part was the margarita. I could easily have about 5 of them, it was so delicious and fresh without that artificial taste.

I definitely want to come back!
