AcW_Km7jkGBr4rJdIrIP4w This is my go to spot for Mexican. Kind of a hidden gem. The service is always speedy, the staff is always friendly, the food is always hot, fresh and authentic. What else can I say? The menu and pricing are similar to La Hacienda and La Bamba's but the food and overall experience is definitely a few notches above
