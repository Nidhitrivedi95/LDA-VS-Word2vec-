MAuSh7NKoT__CQ4BumoayA With a 15 minute wait I expected this place to be next level but I was somewhat disappointed- I found T&T mildly okay compared to a lot of the awesome Mexican restaurants I usually eat at.
Our server was wonderful and brought us drinks straight away- I had the Blueberry Smash cocktail which was overly sweet with not a whole lot of alcohol in it. The chips and salsa were AMAZING, I could have eaten this all day and been a happy woman!
My boyfriend and I ordered Chicken Nachos to share and the Grilled Fish Tacos, the fish tacos were pretty crappy but I guess I shouldn't have been surprised considering we were in the middle of the desert. The Nachos were tasty and I really enjoyed them but the cheese they used made me feel a little queasy.

Probably wouldn't come back again unless with a big group of friends who were down to drink tequila and eat chips and salsa.
