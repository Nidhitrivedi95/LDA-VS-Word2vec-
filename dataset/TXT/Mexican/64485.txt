b207RNqIAhTd4JsRsnXB1Q Had heard many good things about this place and finally visited for lunch yesterday. I came in with low expectations which were met with patio furniture from Pick Up Stix which went bust awhile ago. That made me giggle. The decor is definitely hodge-podgetastic. 

We were greeted and seated in the main dining room. It wasn't very crowded and our waiter was right on top of us. The red and green salsas that came with the chips were fantastic, and the chips were warm but not sure if they were super fresh. Still, I had no problem mowing them down. I ordered a fresh margarita and it was huge, delicious and fresh. Very good marg! One was plenty, they don't skimp on the booze! I went with the Adovada Enchilada dinner because i was told that this was the thing to get. I ordered it Christmas style which I learned meant red and green sauce. This was a very good dish. Its not the traditional enchilada in the sense that the meat was wrapped up. The chunky and flavorful pork was ladled on top of this maybe 1/2 inch thick tortilla cake...for lack of a better word. Covered with red and green sauce and a sexy little fried egg. I will take an egg on pretty much anything. I ate the entire enchilada and a bit of the rice and beans. Next time I would skip the rice and beans and just order ala carte. We had a group of 6 and they added 18% gratuity to our bill.

Solid spot, i will be back with the hubs in tow.
