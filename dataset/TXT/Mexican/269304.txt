woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ The food was the stand out. The apps were our favorite part of the meal, for sure. As many have said before me, the corn and the wings were distinctive and just yummy. We chose the beef and chicken tacos and both were very good, but maybe not the best choices after such distinctive apps.  Next time, I will try something a little more exotic. 
The drinks were interesting but approachable. The gin fizz was a great surprise, as was the iced strawberry-line margarita, with bits of fruit in the drink. Very nice touch. 
When we arrived 15 min early for our 7:30 reservation, we were seated right away, Our server was extremely knowledgeable and with us at every turn, offering good advice. My only disappointment was minor and overcome by the good food and drink. The restaurant was cool and funky (love), but it was too loud to hear anything and too dark for me to actually read the menu. The décor was cool and I loved it, but a slightly lighter touch on the music and lighting would have made it a better experience for us and several of the diners around us joked about the same issues with us. That said, it was an older crowd on a weeknight, so perhaps that explains it!  But I'd go back in a minute, with my flashlight and megaphone - for the wings!
