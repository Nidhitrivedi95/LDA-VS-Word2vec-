27oxCPhgCaylA0U23r2O2g I love the carneseria and bakery here!!!! Not on my side of town but whenever I work in this area I stop here for lunch! Great burritos! And they have lengua!!! I love that each section has a cash register makes it so easy to order and pay. Fresh cut fruit and Mexican waters! When you buy food you get access to a salsa and chip bar! 

Good service and good food!
