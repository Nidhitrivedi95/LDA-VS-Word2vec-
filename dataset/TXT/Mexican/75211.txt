CHFw_V836nIKpWtqMP4E5g Went here one Friday evening with my family.  

The service was very slow and lacking.  The chips and salsa were good but the food was served cold and sloppy.  

The only thing that looked to be good were the margarita's the women at the bar were ordering up.  I guess that was the way to go.

I wouldn't go back...
