9xweM3L_Wva9wOctUeABeA OK, it's Taco Bell. You know what you're getting.But at this store, you're NOT getting inexpensive food. A meager little  "Nacho Cheese Doritos Loco Taco" (which I might have expected to cost $0.79 - $0.99) actually cost $2.09. Even on the Taco Bell website, it's listed at $1.59. Why is the West View store charging 30%+ more than others?
