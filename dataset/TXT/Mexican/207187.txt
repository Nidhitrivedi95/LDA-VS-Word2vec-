However with everything else this place is giving them a run for their money. The tortillas are pressed fresh from dough  and you can taste the freshness. Another thing I liked is that with your burrito they mix all the ingredients so you get a bit of everything each time you take a bite. Their queso in my opinion makes the food taste that much better. Their veggies and salsas are also good the only thing is that the lettuce needs to be shredded more, the pieces were a little big and I wasn't a fan of their chips. The guacamole was really good, overall if I had to choose I would get a burrito from here and just a bag of chips from chipotle cause this place is way better on everything else
