Pb5AfEWAB8GWlHyy-p-l1g My family has been coming to this place FOREVER. I love it! The food is delicious, the service is efficient, and the prices are right. I will continue to come here, and highly suggest it to anyone. It is however, a hole in the wall... which is usually where you find the best food. I wouldn't suggest you take someone for a first date as the decor is mediocre at best, but if your date is not stuck up, and they like good food, go for it.
