F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw We have gone a couple times and it's very consistent with the quality and service, both of which are excellent. 

The Highlights:

-100% the cucumber margarita! Best margarita I've had hands down, and I'm normally a frozen margarita kinda girl. I was shocked by the price actually being lower than I expected for the quality of the drink. 

-The service is excellent. No matter how busy they are, we always have a great experience with their employees. They are super informative and patient with questions. Good job hiring manager! 

-atmosphere is fun and young, but anyone  of any age can eat there and have an enjoyable time! 

The only thing I would say that takes away a star is that the menu isn't very big. There are very few main course options and I wish there were a few more entrees to choose from. 

Overall it's a great, fun, lively place to have a date night or a get together with friends!
