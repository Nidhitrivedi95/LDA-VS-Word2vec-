FoKx_RP4kUM-aiGo3wlUUw I really can't believe I haven't written a review yet for my favorite neighborhood place, Las Glorias. I love this little gem so much: wonderful, homemade food and the warmest and friendliest staff.

My favorites? The bean dip that comes with the salsa is fantastic ... not too spicy but creamy and flavorful. Whenever I feel a cold coming on, I order a large bowl of their chicken tortilla soup. It's so substantial with a good mix of chicken chunks, fresh vegetables, avocado and a savory broth. Does it cure my cold? Nope, but it really does make me feel better! Their fish tacos are my favorite in the Valley and come with whole beans that I could eat an entire potful of. If it's Friday night and my SO and I don't feel like waiting 40 minutes for one of the trendy CenPho dinner spots, we hang out at Las Glorias and get one of their tasty margaritas and their chicken avocado salad with cilantro dressing and pepitas. The man loves that they always have a sports game on TV. I love the super comfy booths and welcoming decor. They also serve a delicious garlic fish (and a few other great seafood dishes) so you don't have to sacrifice healthy eating for a night out. Don't be put off by the strip mall. They'll get to updating it eventually but for now, it houses this lovely little place so I'll take it.
