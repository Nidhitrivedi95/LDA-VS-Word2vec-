hJda5g5v_2rT3D-3mSf7cQ I can't believe, in this yelp crowd, no one has reviewed this place. It's a place for drinking, getting rowdy, and I'm not sure one would try the food - I haven't. 
I hear it actually isn't that bad food, but that's not really why you go here. It's mainly because it's a personable place, with generally good staff, who will serve you reasonable priced beers, and you can have fun. It's not a bad place to meet people too, because it's small and people end up talking table to table.
