1ZJz840L496LAmQdeDv0WA I went to Pinches Tacos yesterday for Cinco de Mayo. It was nuts, but I expected it to be. The gringos tacos are probably the best tacos I've ever had in my life. Their guacamole is also delicious. The wait at the bar is why I didn't give them 5 stars. I understand that it was crazy, but we were given our drinks and then had to stand there waiting for the bill on more than one occasion. They need to add another register at the bar if they can't keep up with customer demand at that point. There was one particular man who helped me out more than once and I wish I had gotten his name, but he was in a white Pinches t-shirt and a blue hat. He was very sincere with his checking in on customers and he helped me out very promptly. I live in far North Las Vegas, but I'm thinking of driving over to Pinches for more of those tacos.
