kYvZZ_aKaKLQKeyms74T2Q This Mexican restaurant at Flamingo near Hualapai is very good. We went there for lunch recently, and though the welcome at the front desk by two very young gals was lackluster, our waiter was courteous, affable and efficient. The chile relleno/tamale/enchilada combination plate was perfectly prepared, with authentic refried beans and Spanish rice. The lunch crowd included two tables of serious business people, which suggested that the place is a local favorite for luncheon meetings. The décor is rustic and classic old Mexican, with charming artifacts presented in tasteful fashion here and there. The salsa, an important component of any Southwestern meal, had the right combination of flavor and heat. I could easily eat lunch at this branch of Lindo Michoacan every week, it is that appealing. See my photos of the place's unique, stately exterior.
