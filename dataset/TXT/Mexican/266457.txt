wfnvI08SMHeIH6_lOeZ7xA I went to Mariachi's based on previous Yelp reviews.  I had the "East L.A.," which is a chicken chimichanga and beef burrito entree, with guacamole as an appetizer.  

I found the guacomole to be a little bland, and the chicken dry.  The beef burrito had good flavor.  

Overall, the service was very prompt, and our meals were served promptly, and for $12 the entree was worth it.
