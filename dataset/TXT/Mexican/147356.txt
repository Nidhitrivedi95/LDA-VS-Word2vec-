jppxrDQLXr4Nk8cV7IGlcw I have never in my 23 years as a human being on this earth thought my experience  at a restaurant could be so terrible! This place makes me want to start my own Mexican eatery directly next to them and put them out of business. Other than that the food was actually worse then Taco Bell and the service could be compared to .... oh ya I have never experienced anything this bad !  The manager/hostess?(we really didn't know) Literally yelled at an old man because he wanted to sit at one of the 5 empty tables in the restaurant! If I could give a zero I would but that is not how yelp works!  Usually I don't leave responses but didn't want anyone to suffer like we did! Cheers!
