73cpMzeoX52k3-qilLmWWg I don't know where to start, but I'll start by mentioning that I am from Tucson where all the good mexican food is so it is HARD (been looking for three years)  to find an even DECENT Mexican restaurant in the valley UNTIL I found Martha's Kitchen! Her food is DELICIOUS! I've had her barcaboa tacos, burritos, and quesadilla and I'm never disappointed!  I read some of her reviews that it was "pricey" but I think it's bogus considering the amount of food you get, not to mention the quality and taste of it. Oh and yes she uses paper plates to serve in but I didn't realize that was ever an issue at a "whole in the wall place". Just come and eat, enjoy your food and throw away your place. Lol. Simple as that. I unfortunately have been on a diet so I haven't been in for a couple of months but everyone please enjoy her food and think of me while you eat it! Hahaha
