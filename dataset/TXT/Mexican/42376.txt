75u8X_saAIETRHgpECi8YA If you're in the area you have to stop by for Taco Tuesday. $1.50 tacos! There are different specials everyday. 

This Taco place is not some hole in the wall nasty floor taco shop. You walk in and its a clean hip taco shop with great decor on the walls. Has a modern rustic feel. The bar seats about 10 people, but the chairs are too high and too close. I would suggest getting a table if available. 

As first timers we got the Queso fundido. The cheese isn't a traditional queso fundido but it was still tasty. I do wish the chips were made in house. The chips are store bought. 

The tacos were really good. The size of your palm taco size. Good portion of meat as well. The tacos come with one salsa of choice. Habanero was spicy but missing some flavor.

The service was great! Sweet server and always checked on us.

I do plan on coming back to try the gourmet burritos and salads.
