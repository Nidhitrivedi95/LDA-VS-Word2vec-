rbYh1ue3YpdOt1GIUs2YBg First time here, but definitely not the last. I hear people come to this place from all over the valley because they're that good! I'm just sad we hadn't tried it sooner, especially since we live a mile and a half away! I got tacos al pastor and Bri got carne asada, and the corn tortillas are amazing! Next time I'm going to try the vampiros.
