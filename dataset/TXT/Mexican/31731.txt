4K5NUsinIgtq-yuxdp2HdA I just love this place so much, it was the first place I went to on Mill when my stepsister was giving me the tour. The chips and queso are phenomenal, basically worth a visit just for them alone. Have yet to try one of the beer-Rita's but as an innocent freshman who'd barely just gotten past sneaking my stepdads Coors, I was amazed to see such a creation. The atmosphere is lively and the service is usually fast!
