XVN0Mg7oABOWAWO3t9tXpw This Rubio's location is pretty much like any other, except I saw a girl accidentally spill her soda into the salsa and pico de gallo and a person came from behind the counter to help her clean everything up.  BUT I never saw them change out the salsa or pico.  Sick.

Other than that, they have the standard fast food mexican fare, tostadas, burritos, quesadillas, tacos, rice bowls etc... and they're all pretty good.  I still like Baja better though.
