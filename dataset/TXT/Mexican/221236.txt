rl137V_5Hx0cJAV4beVdhA I had 4 different tacos and they were all excellent, my favourite being the tinga de pollo. The shrimp taco is fairly spicy.

Service was good, with the tacos served one by one, not all at once.

The price range should be changed from $ to $$, it's not cheap. They take only cash and debit.
