h4Q-uSoOIhMoIsOhat6l3A I love Mexican food and this place definitely is one of the best in Vegas. One of the reasons I am giving 4 stars is because the food took a while compared to the other location and I like the decor of the other location better. I got the chips and guacamole to start, it was good but I prefer guacamole to have more of a spicy flavor in it. This one was very bland. My entree was 1 cheese enchilada and 1 cheese tamale. The cheese enchilada with green sauce was so good!! This is definitely my favorite place to get enchiladas. However, I ordered a cheese tamale and they brought me one with meat which as a vegetarian I can not eat. The waiter gave me a cheese one once I showed him mine had meat but it took a while so that is another reason I gave 4 stars. Overall, the service is friendly and the food is definitely good. Hopefully this location gets a little faster with their service in the future!
