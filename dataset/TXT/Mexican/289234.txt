YkOCo5ipV2he2WXIAlZb-A Super stoked when I found out this place was opening down the street from me! I used to go to the one off Sahara and the 15 but it's a little far for me. Overall I was pretty happy with my food. I got the rockport on seaweed. I added seaweed salad and omitted the red onions. My burrito was huge and it didn't fall apart on me! *thumbs up* They also have UCC creamy melon soda which is awesome because normally I can only find it in Chinatown. I'm not a soda drinker but that's the soda I'll drink every once in a great while. 

My only gripe is that there's definitely room for more tables without having everyone bumping elbows. I didn't want to take my food to go but I didn't have much of a choice.
