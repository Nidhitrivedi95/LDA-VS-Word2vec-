DaVTuhzi6EgWStb2eAjNjA If you like chorizo, this is your holy grail! The menu is extensive and they have a lot of incredibly interesting things on there. We had a really tough time making a decision but settled on the chorizo fundido. Who would've known that just two ingredients mixed together would have such a dynamite flavor?! Our server brought it out in a skillet while the cheese will still bubbling. Nestled beautifully on top was a generous layer of one of the most delicious tasting chorizo I've ever had! They make their tortilla and chorizo in house, and it tastes incredibly fresh and flavorful. I will be getting the fundido every time I visit this place! 


After scraping every little bit of this, we decided to order the pollo, al pastor and chorizo (duhhh!) tacos. To be entirely honest, their al pastor was quite forgettable and chicken was alright. The chorizo taco, however, knocked it out of the park! This obviously came as no surprise. Overall, I think this is a pretty great establishment and I'll definitely return to try some more things from the menu.
