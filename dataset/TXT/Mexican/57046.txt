A73Dp0lo9s_Ci9NFDqbhqw A clean Taco Bell location

PROS: 
one of the cleanest TB locations that I've been in
Friendly Staff

CONS:
Okay, this will sound silly... but it's annoying the way you have to enter and exit the location.  You can't go Rt. 48 South when leaving  *smh* and you can't enter when traveling Rt. 48 North without turning into the Oak Park Mall shopping center and then you have to circle the lot so that you don't violate any traffic laws to turn into the designated turn-in.  It's pretty bizarre!
