$10.11 after taxes for a burrito bowl. I'd say its worth it! Though, I do think this particular location is a bit stingy on how much they pack in your bowl. I was taking my bowl to-go, and there was still room at the top when I unpackaged my bowl...sadness. The food quality was great though. It was a bit spicier than the Yorkdale and Vaughan Mills locations, but it may have just been that particular batch. I actually enjoyed it spicier. Who would have known? Service was a bit slow relative to other Chipotle locations, but fast if you've never been to a Chipotle before. i.e. They took about 20 seconds before they acknowledged me despite me standing there and one guy just standing around staring at the food preparation area. Not sure what he was waiting for...But once he finally asked me what I wanted, everything ran smoothly.
