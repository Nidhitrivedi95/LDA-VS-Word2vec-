D9Uf7UmU2KlgS_H8lJwOrA Since I've been here like a dozen times since my previous review figured it was due for an update. This place is amazing. Cheap, huge burritos and kind, quick service. More consistent quality than most places. Decor still not great, but whatever, once you get your food you'll forget all about the weird cactus paintings. Highly recommended.
