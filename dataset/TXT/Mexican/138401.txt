IyrDnrvUKpndj5zIv1KvGQ Let's start with the good things,  the service was excellent and the portions are big. 

The food is terrible.  I wanted to like this place.  But the food was not flavored well and the tamales while huge where very bland. If you are use to mexican food from so cal you will be disappointed here.

The final thing that makes this place bad is the prices, $4.50 for one tamale! Most combos are over 15 dollars.

Sorry but this place is a pass.
