eahfGaQEkrsOkjyYHAaT-Q I live right around the corner so I've eaten here a few times (I just ordered it for pick-up as I type this!). 

I always get the same thing so I can't speak to anything else on the menu but I always get a small bean and cheese with pinto beans on white with a large supreme fries. Someone else wrote that no one makes them as good as the owner does and that is true. He will really stuff the burrito while other employees don't fill it up as much. I'm not greedy though and what I do get is still always enough. I always get mine spicy which is always hit and miss - sometimes it's spicy as hell and sometimes it's not spicy at all. 

The supreme fries with beef are delicious but same thing - if the boss doesn't make 'em, it's not as full. 

I always get consistently good food and service so I have no complaints.
