ZCe93zAkxr2KOBU1NT0lmg My family and I have been going to Valle Luna for many years, and unfortunately in the last couple years it seems like the service and food has dramatically declined. My most recent visit was on 10/16/2016 with my older sister and parents. We we there for lunch to celebrate my Dad's birthday. 

I was surprised that we didn't have to wait for a table since it was Sunday afternoon, so that was nice. Once we were seated, our waitress came by a few minutes later to take our drink order, where she also asked if we wanted an appetizer. We ordered a cheese crisp to start. We waited a little longer than usual before she came back, but I figured it was just because it was a busy lunch time. Well, once she finally brought our drinks, that was all we had to drink for the remainder of our meal, she didn't ask us or bring any refills after that. 

We never got our cheese crisp, and she didn't address it until our meal had already been served. Although she did say sorry, she mad a comment that someone else must have snagged it.

Our food was mediocre, and they must have changed the recipe for their cheese enchiladas, because my Mom ordered 2, and they were stuffed with black olives. In all my years eating there, I've never had olives stuffed in the enchilada. Is that a thing now? Yuck. 

We waited quite some time for our server to "check on" us and by then we were just about ready for the bill. 

The only consistency that I've experienced here in awhile is the chips and salsa being the best. Next time, we will consider going somewhere else.
