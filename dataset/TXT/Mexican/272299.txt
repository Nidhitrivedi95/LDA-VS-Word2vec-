WTGmtvIE1v9uEBZxiyXImQ Very cool place that shoots for upscale and trendy.  Good prices, limited menu, smallish portions.  Great service & presentation.  Not the standard Mexican food I was expecting but it was really good.  A nice change, good place for a date or to meet friends.  Nice bar area and small dining area as well as small patio.
