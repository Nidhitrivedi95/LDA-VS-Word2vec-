ZLG7N4VDGzo7V0ViITi93Q First time here this past Sunday and I ordered a juice called la más fresca I think and it was super lemony and great then I got the torta ahogada and the carnitas inside we're cooked PERFECT. Nice and crunchy I loved every bite of it. Then I took the fresas con crema to go and they were also AMAZING. Great service as well I recommend this spot.
