Wc9UpJhOcdSj7olZkz7SJA Great tasting burgers! Fries are good too, tried the tacos & didn't like them as much. Only complaint is it does take awhile I thought it might be quicker to go in then use the drive thru like we usually do...my husband said that three cars that arrived after us already went through the drive thru before I came out. The employees are friendly & if you like sweets definitely get a shake they are delicious!
