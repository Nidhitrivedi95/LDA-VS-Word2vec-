7m1Oa1VYV98UUuo_6i0EZg Damn good burger!  Was visiting from California and seen so many great reviews, just had to check it out as we were craving a burger and fries. Glad we came in, we will definitely be back as we have moved to Arizona!  The shake wasn't as good as sadly, but again, the food was GREAT!
