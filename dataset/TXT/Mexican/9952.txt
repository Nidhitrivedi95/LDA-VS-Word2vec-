_WtxQbDK7B-ExGdeG-2j6Q What a fun place to have brunch. We went on a Saturday morning and it wasn't packed yet. The bartender was fantastic and put us "in the right mind" to have a great experience. Her bloody mary was delicious and so was my friend's margarita. She personalized them and had fun doing it! She handled a full bar with ease. They even had a decent tap selection. The food was good but not as flavorful as I had hoped. The green chile was rather bland and the tortilla definitely did not seem homemade.  Enchiladas had a decent balanced flavor but were a little soggy. However, the eggs were cooked perfectly and the ambiance and service will definitely steer us back for another try besides brunch.
