3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ The location looks so awesome inside. It's like an old monastery or old church. 

Happy hour prices are where it's at with this place if you are looking to get lit. They have a couple of combo one is "The Socializer" which is any draught beer and a shot of Sauza Blue Reposado for only $9. Or they have "The Americana" which is any draught beer and a shot of Roger Clyne's Mexican Moonshine 12. 

They have a couple of TV's situated high above the bar. Not ideal for sports but can do in a pinch. 

Overall the tacos were good and the vibe was solid. Ill be back.
