Delicious food, I had the huevos rancheros, my husband had the chicken/enchilada combo,. Tortilla lady made fresh tortillas there in front of us and they were so yummy. The other thing I appreciated was the service. The people were extremely attentive and I'm sure they are a big reason the restaurant is successful. Raul was a especially great. We actually went back the next day and had the same great meal and the same great service.
