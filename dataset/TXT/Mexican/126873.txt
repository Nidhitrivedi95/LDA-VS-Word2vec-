hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg Had high expectations for this place, especially having finally watched the episode where chef Chuck Hughes defeated Bobby Flay on Iron Chef and having gone to the Bremmer were we had an amazing dining experience.
We shared 5 appetizers, the clams, the bison tartar, the octopus, the lobster rolls and the lobster poutine.
Everything was good but nothing was spectacular or made we want to continue ordering. 
The lobster poutine was original and they were definitely generous on the lobster serving but it wasn't the best poutine I've ever had.
The octopus was somewhat dry, the lobster roll lacked seasoning and overall that wow factor you would expect at a place like this just wasn't there.
Especially when considering the price, it just wasn't worth it.
Probably won't be going back again.
