frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A This place is epic. The menu is extensive (almost overwhelming, you have to read it slowly) and offers so many awesome combination. Taco lovers: meet your new favorite place. In addition to awesome tacos they even have a great salsa bar where you can try all sorts of salsas with different heat levels which really add flavor to your tacos. I HIGHLY suggest the La Santisima taco with steak: it's out of this world!
