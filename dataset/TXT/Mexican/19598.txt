1Vvxx-9AoINg8TJXOZgEHg Decent Mexican food at a good Las Vegas price, service on point and quick, and drinks that appeal to anyone.  And it can easily accommodate large groups.

On the drink menu the Pink Cadillac is listed before the Best Buddy Margarita.  This is also representative that the Pink Cadillac (aka Watermelon Margarita) is better than the other margarita flavors (strawberry, raspberry, or mango).  It is sweet (it is a flavored margarita after all), and comes with a slice of watermelon so it must be healthy.  Also watermelon liqueur, which I need to go get some now.  A lot of drinks were ordered by the table, and everyone was satisfied with their choice.

On to the food, and first the appetizers.  It's a Mexican place, so of course one needs to partake in chips and guac.  The guacamole is made fresh at your table, with tomato, onion, jalapeno, cilantro and lime juice.  The presentation is nice, the guac is fresh, and the flavor simple.  The portion of chips is appropriate for the amount of guacamole, but you can ask for more too.  Also under the appetizers are Tostadas, which can come in Chicken Tinga or Beef Machaca.  These are large open tacos with lots of fixings.  The Chicken Tinga came with more flavor than the Beef.  By the time that my entree, the Mexican Gulf Shrimp Street Tacos, arrived I was pretty full.  All tacos come with the options of black or pinto beans, and Mexican or Cilantro rice.  I opted for the cilantro rice, but did not detect any flavor from the cilantro, only the green coloring.  The Shrimp Tacos themselves were seared nicely, and the pineapple-garlic marinade was reminiscent of my time in more tropical locations than Las Vegas.
