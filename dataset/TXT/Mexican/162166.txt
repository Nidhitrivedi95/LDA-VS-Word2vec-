l1GJnB9TJgGgEeI4at1M0A Look, there's no getting around the fact that Vegas is expensive. EXPENSIVE AS FUCK. However, if you do a little yelp searching you can always find hidden gems and this is exactly what EFCM is. This is your standard, order a taco or burrito and be happy, Mexican joint. The food is the kind that hits the spot from the chips and salsa to the enchiladas. The staff that work there are extremely friendly and since we were lucky to get there at the beginning of the lunch hour, it wasn't packed at all.

The location is a little off the beaten path but you won't regret going here. DO IT!
