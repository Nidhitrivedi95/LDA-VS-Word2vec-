prdA1r8XP03oD-PYvZJ5AA Stopped here today for a quick lunch during a 2-hour layover at PHX. I got a grilled chicken taco on a flour tortilla, minus the queso and beans, and a shredded beef taco on a corn tortilla. I had figured the corn one would be a hard shell but it was actually soft shell. 

The tacos were pretty good, a little pricey (around $11-12) but that's typical for airport food. It has a limited seating area but I found a seat at the bar, there are a few tables to sit at as well.
