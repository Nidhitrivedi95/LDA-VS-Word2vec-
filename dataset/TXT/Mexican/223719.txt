RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg First time coming here,  and I can honestly say not the best tacos at all. Been hearing about this place for the longest time decided to give it a shot, the wait time was almost 20-30 minutes. I ordered 7 tacos de asada and a quesadilla. I thought the quesadilla was a regular quesadilla honestly, nope it isn't it's pretty much the same size of a taco just added with some cheese that thing is like $5 the small portion that it is , too over priced. Then to top it off the tacos where HELLA SALTY couldn't enjoy my food at all had to down every bite with my horchata shitty tacos I've ever had, least I can say I tried it and not coming back,  too over hyped. Coming from all the way from LA , not worth the money whatever I paid here could've gone to a nice restaurant for better taste in food.
