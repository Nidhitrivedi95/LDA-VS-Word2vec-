SW6ZQk22G1_CV81_gfnvNQ ok it was yum but not like line up for hours yummy. 
I had the fish tacos, corn fritters (YUM), churros, guac and a few other things. I think I actually prefer the fish tacos from grand electric better. The guac was good but not the best. I don't know if i would eat there again also because it's not a comfortable dining experience. some tables are communal (seriously, who wants to pay good $$ at a restaurant to share tables with people?) and I've heard about the wait times and there is no way i'd wait that long to eat some tacos that are just "alright"
