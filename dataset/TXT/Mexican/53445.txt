9pvJiPUzB5JTqhNTloKjvA Dont expect to call here to set an order because they dont answer! I called three times and got thier voicemail. I go ahead to the resturant and ask if their phone is working correctly and the blonde cashier responds "Oh someone must have been on the phone" Uh excuse me is this not a business? And NO ONE EXPECTS A TORTA THAT HAS NOTHING IN IT! Paid $9.18 today at noon and got the smallest torta of my life. i even wait 10 minutes to get this. Might be able to keep white folks happy but sure as hell can't keep hispanic people happy.
Update:
OK. Besides the negativity, the Director handled things very well and I do not doubt that my next visit will be anything but excellent. I appreciated his prompt response, and he definitely made up for what was lacking. I will return and I am sure this time around I will be satisfied.
