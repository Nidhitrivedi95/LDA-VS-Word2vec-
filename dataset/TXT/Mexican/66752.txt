Bf2fuqWbHd3L-X69FSMvmg Your better off getting tacos at taco bell. This place sucks. The tacos were horrible. I got the chicken tacos. The meat didn't look or taste like chicken. Idk what it was. The quesadilla was suppose to be two tortillas filled with chicken and veggies. It was basically one big taco which was weird. The margaritas were horrible. They were served warm and we're horribly made. I will never go back to this place. Its pretty bad Mexican food.
