pomGBqfbxcqPv14c3XH-ZQ Saturday evening we used a YELP reservation and were seated promptly. The place was packed with a large line of others waiting for a table!

1) Excellent service that "deserved" more than a standard tip.

2) Broad range of interesting menu choices.

3) Every item we ordered deserved a minimum of a "B" with most of them deserving an "A"!

4) Price was more than fair considering all the above comments I've shared.
