iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg It's not often I'm blown away by Mexican food, but I went back here TWICE in ONE week, which says a lot about how much I enjoyed the food!

The place is REALLY small, so be prepared to wait in line - but it is worth it!
Try a variety of their tacos; they are all very fresh and piping hot, and you can add 3 different sauces on them...the hot sauce is REALLY hot so don't pile your taco with it like I did! (My tongue burnt after for the entire day)! 

Their agua frescas are also delicious, I tried the pineapple one. 

Can't wait to be back next time!
