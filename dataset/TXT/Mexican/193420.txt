OOwG23cwNbSbxC1XOJd6aQ Came here for lunch today to grab some take out. I got a salad with no meat although I do enjoy their chicken and steak. It was really much more delicious than I expected! All the ingredients were extremely fresh and the pico was amazing I am a huge pico de gallo fan and could put theirs on anything. Only thing I don't like is that nothing really comes with chips like they do at moes here you have to purchase them separate. 

Really clean inside and very friendly staff. Wish they had a salsa bar. Lots of parking they are inside a shopping plaza but traffic can be kinda crazy at like all times of the day. Kid friendly and has a patio for outdoor seating when the weather is nice!
