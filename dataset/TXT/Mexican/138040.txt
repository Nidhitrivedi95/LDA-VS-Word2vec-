Iw9k29FJCZ0fC68oxK1NtA Absolutely my favorite eatery in Kent. The owners continue to be inventive with the menu yet you can always get a delicious standard (mine is the sweet potato/back bean burrito).  I love that they locally source ingredients whenever possible.  Whenever guests are in from out of town,  Taco Tontos and Ray's are always where we go. These two restaurants are Kent treasures. Thank you to all of the staff for the good energy you put into the food and for the vibe you create in the restaurant.
