oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ I wish I could give no star. Service is really bad. The host didn't even say hi to us. We asked for water from our server and she forgot to give it us. She went on a break and no one checked on us. I had to get up and find a server to get some water. When we were ready to pay, I had to get up again to find a server to get us our tab. 
The food was just ok and overpriced. 
Will never come to this place again.
