LLWOrt8Vo5kyA9qeo-Y76g It's official: Moreno's is my favorite Mexican food place in the valley. The Tejano burro isn't just good, it's now one of my favorite meals! Every dish we've ever ordered has been excellent. If anyone ever asks for a Mexican food recommendation, this is where I send them. Yum!!
