GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog My coworkers and I ate here recently while in town for a conference.  I have been here several times and I think this was the best experience.  We went for the Chef's Experience: A tour
of China and Mexico's favorite traditional and modern flavors.  This was not on the menu when I was there previously.  We got so much good food, it was awesome and never ending.  

We started with the salt air margaritas.  I tried the pomegranate one and it was delicious.  I am not one for margaritas normally but this one was good.  

I think these are the dishes we had.  All were delicious. 

Guacamole made one-by-one/ queso fresco/fresh tortillas
Cochinita Yucatan-style pit barbecue pork/ marinated onions 
When Pigs Fly 4pc delicate steamed buns/Chinese barbecue pork
Siu Mai - Traditional 6pc shrimp/pork/ jicama/mushrooms/ peanuts 
Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice fresh vegetables/fried rice 
Tuna Ceviche tuna/amaranth seeds/ soy sauce/pecans
Churos with chocolate sauce

I think there were a few other dishes and one more dessert.  So good.  I definitely will be back.
