fYTfTGqseS7rJk9AMt2zvw I'm reminded of some 90s song lyric "if you don't expect too much from me, you might not be let down". And that's how I feel about On the Border. A  middle of the road chain restaurant with decent service and edible food. Authentic Mexican street food? Not a chance. Decent? Why not. This is a good spot for folks like my parents who (god bless em) like Mexican-ish food for gringos. Think Taco Bell's more mature big brother, Taco Bell after Taco Bell's first divorce. 
You have 100 better options in Charlotte for Latin food, but OTB isn't hurting anything.
