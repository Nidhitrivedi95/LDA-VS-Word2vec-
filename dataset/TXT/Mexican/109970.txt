fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg One star because as a Mexican, I enjoy authentic Mexican food or at the very least not bland tasting and also you can tell this is a white person's take on our traditional plates. I really missed spiciness and sorry but Tapatio and Cholula just won't cut it. The waiter, Julián, was cool though. It was also over priced.
