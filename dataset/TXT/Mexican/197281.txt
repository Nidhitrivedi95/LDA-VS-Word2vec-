oxv2UyI5yF6yawPU20tOxA I was disappointed in our experience. After waiting for an hour for a table, we were taken to the bar section of the restaurant which smelled like a fraternity basement. I was also offended to see the blue tortilla's made in an open public area by an individual not wearing gloves. Gross!
