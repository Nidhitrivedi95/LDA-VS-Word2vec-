yvqcZrHixuf_oIUW83xUcQ The reason I give this a 3 star review is because of service. Not from our waitress but the support staff. First the support staff is terrible. We waited over 20 min for a refill on drinks and the check. For this reason your waitress tonight on left room(sorry I don't have her name but she was the only one) gets slammed by her to hostess sitting at front talking. Then second reason you give her a bus boy that should be filling waters, clearing dishes, ect this poor lady is running her A.. Off and then customers get mad at her. I know how it is and this is a management problem. Bus boys do more than bring chips. He could have rinsed our cups, brought a to go box, filled our waters. So she can do her job. Ownership needs to take action. This is 3 stars overall for a reason. Food is only average. Bring your place back to action. We be sad to see this location go too.
