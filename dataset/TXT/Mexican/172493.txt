mbfu9ag4VQYIi6dvhCX2dQ Ordered the chicken soup with quesadillas lunch special. Good price point and good service. The soup had way too many tortilla chips and way too few pieces of chicken. Even if you call it tortilla soup it should be a sprinkle on the top not a main ingredient to buffer having better ingredients. Taste wise it was ok and lacking in flavor. The quesadillas were delicious as was the hot green sauce. The red sauce is just ok. Chips were hot and fresh and I like the carafes provided for the salsa. I would like to return and have a combo meal. I've tried the tacos in the summer when they post up inside Legion brewery and they are very good, especially after the 4 mile run. There aren't many Mexican restaurant choices here in Charlotte. Being from California I wouldn't come back to this place especially with the  stiff Bay Area competition but being in Charlotte I would come again due to the great location and lack of competition. The clientele is mostly Latin folks so that is a good sign.
