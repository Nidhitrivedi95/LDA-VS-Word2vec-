I think the prices are pretty much the same.  I got the chicken bowl in a large container but the food barely filled the container half way.  Food was just ok, could have gotten more food for the price I was paying.

They charge extra for coin or roasted green peppers and onions (faijta vegetables) so I'd prefer Chiptole for that alone.

It's a decent option in the area at night if you don't want to go to a sit down restaurant.
