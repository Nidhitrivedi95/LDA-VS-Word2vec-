9t8PEynZGVCG1EjOQr1xBA I've gotten take-away from CST several times, and I can say that they have the best nachos in Las Vegas. Note that I'm from the Midwest, and this is similar to what nachos are like there. I've had better tortas and quesadillas elsewhere, but theirs are decent. This is my new favorite taco shop in town.
