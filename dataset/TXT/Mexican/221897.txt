I could always count on excellent taste and service at the Luchita's on W. 117th in Cleveland (and a now-closed operation in Mentor). The menu went past the usual AmeriMex to include more authentic choices.

Went to the Hudson Luchita's on a Thursday evening. With the restaurant half-full, I was led past many empty tables to a spot right next to the (cold-leaking) window. Service was brusque. Menu was more limited than the others, which wasn't promising.

The cheese-and-poblano tamales were odd. Two tamales, one covered with red sauce and one with green, but slopped together so the sauces mostly blended. The red-sauced tamale had a very thin vein of filling, perhaps shoelace-sized, with a few shreds of poblano and threads of cheese. I had to go through 80% of the length of the other one before I finally found two shreds of pepper and a small glob of cheese; most of it was just cornmeal all the way through. Dry cornmeal.

My main course was the tinga de pollo, which was one of my faves from Mentor. But when I lifted a forkful of this tinga, I revealed a deep pool of watery liquid. The chicken itself was extremely salty, masking other flavors.

A minor point, but the waitress did that annoying thing where, when you agree to a water refill, she whisks away your half-full glass and you have to wait for her to putter around the other tables before you finally get it back. And then she stuck it at the far end of the table from me -- literally up to the edge.
