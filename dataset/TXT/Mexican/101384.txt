EUxbuNT8BYPs_h0vVMy2pg Excellent homemade Mexican food! If you want authentic this is the place to be. The red chile enchiladas are out of this world. The sauce is too die for and tastes like it was simmering for hours with red chili peppers. I also love how thy give you a complimentary bowl of chips with beans and cheese with salsa when you arrive. My kids love this! Everything I've ordered from here has been delicious. Their crunchy beef tacos have tons of flavor along with theo carne asada burritos. We love coming here. I just wish it was bigger. The place is so small and always crowded.
