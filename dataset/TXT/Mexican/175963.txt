MQEpDvkdL39hh1N0We3Vaw I went on a Sunday around brunch time with 4 friends and we were seated on the outside patio. Like the other bars and restaurants in this strip on the light rail, the service is absolutely terrible. After our waitress took our food and drink orders, we didn't see her again until an hour later when our food finally arrived. (It wasn't crowded.) We had to go up to the bar and ask for water refills. 

As for the food, I ordered a burrito with chicken, steak, and shrimp. The portion size was massive, but within expectations after seeing the price of the entree. It was okay, but I probably wouldn't order it again.

To their credit, there are some great drink specials on the weekend which earns them a 2 star rating in my book instead of 1.
