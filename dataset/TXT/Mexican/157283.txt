KK7-mHecrlhTIXxW1eATEw Well I've been coming here for the past 15 years or more primarily for the Posole.  After today, not sure I'll go back.  I go around 12:15 on a Wednesday during holiday season 12-30-15.  The place is packed, one waitress is taking Care of about 25 people.  This is family owned, and I'm a regular, The Mom is cashier, son is in the kitchen, daughter is waitress.  I grab a two top table in the corner. Took about 10 minutes to get acknowledged. I give her a break, they're very busy.  I don't need a menu, when she came over I said Posole and iced tea. She quickly slammed my chips, salsa, and tea on my table and went about her business.  It usually takes all of two or three minutes to get a bowl of posole.  How hard is it to stick a ladle in the pot and put it a bowl?  Today it took 20 minutes, I wasn't real happy. Again she just slammed it on the table without the cabbage, onions, lime, cilantro.  I finally had to walk up to the register to ask her to bring it to me!  This was another 7 minute ordeal.  The posole here is generally pretty bland and needs spicing up.  Today was no exception...Bottom Line, I do believe I've found slightly better Posole in the valley and seriously doubt at this point I'll be back to Los Picos.  Sad, sad...All good things come to an end.
