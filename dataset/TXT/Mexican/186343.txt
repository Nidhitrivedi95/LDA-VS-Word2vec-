NYpmDzwzAQyv0gQG5gBKbw Pachuco is an intimate space. I mean, really intimate. I stopped by for quick appetizer and drink with a friend and we opted to sit at the bar. I had the Mexican Cosmo and my friend had the Spicy Mango Margarita. Both of the drinks were amazing, but I really have to rave about the spicy mango! It was great flavor, not to strong but just the right amount of kick, and the seasoning they put on top was a nice touch. 

We opted to go with the goat cheese guacamole for our appetizer and it was really good! I enjoyed the freshness of our tortilla chips. We decided to try the churros because who can say no to churros when they are served POUTINE STYLE (perfect for sharing!). They were fabulous, but remember to eat quickly or they will get soggy (we got caught up in our conversation and they were soggy yet delicious when we finished them off, but I am not a huge fan of the soggy texture).

Sitting at the bar was a fun experience because the bartender was sweet and friendly, she was always checking in on us to make sure we were having a good time. One of the owners also came down and asked us how everything was. We're going back next week to have dinner! The space is really fun and eclectic and I look forward to tasting the rest of their menu.
