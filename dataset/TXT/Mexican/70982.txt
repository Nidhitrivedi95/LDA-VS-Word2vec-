C2BR0TjNacoNzItPLUHTAA Pros:
Clean
Tasty fresh food - not soggy and old 
Fast 
Wonderful flavors
Nice helpful staff

Cons:
The portions are a bit small. Some of us were still hungry after eating our meals.

We ordered the "tower" - its like the fish tacos but with brown rice instead of the tortillas we also ordered several of the fish tacos orders.
