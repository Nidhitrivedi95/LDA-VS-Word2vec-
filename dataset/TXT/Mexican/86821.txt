DI5lVpHe3xf-IPr_mgzxyg I sometimes provide lunches for Medical Practices and I can always count on Rubio's. The food is fresh and looks wonderful. It is delivered on time and everyone is very friendly. Today I ordered lunch and Donnia helped with the catering order. She was upbeat, polite and very helpful. Thank you to the whole team there at the Goodyear office. You will continue to be one of my first choices.
