_Kd0kQ8RF70hJ1ykLqCRyQ This rating is just for the food, which is almost always good. This Cafe Rio has changed a lot since I left for college in 2011. I used to crave Cafe Rio when I was at school and it was always my first or last stop coming home or leaving. That's not the case here any more. 

Since I left for school they expanded and bought the space next door to expand their seating area. Either I come in at the wrong times or this place is always almost empty. It always used to be packed! What happened?

Here's a hint: it's the staff. I used to feel welcomed here but now the employees act like it's a chore for them to do their jobs. Going down the line today the first guy almost got my mom's order wrong, the middle lady was extremely slow, and the cashier was straight up rude. When I asked her for an order of chips and queso she said "You have to ask her (referring to the slow lady) for the chips and queso." Excuse me? Last time I checked you're the one who asks if I would like any drinks or chips. As I turned to the lady to ask the cashier turned around and began talking to her friend who was wiping down trays. Seriously? And she kept talking to her friend while we were at the counter waiting for our food! That is a big no no in a customer service job. She was even still talking to her friend when she gave my mom her receipt! Really girl? Your conversation was that important that you completely ignored us for most of the transaction and was still rude? You've got a lot of nerve. 

Bottom line, the food is good but don't expect good customer service.
