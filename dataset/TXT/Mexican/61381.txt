ASC3JV2Jh09lTyJZ98UMFA This restaurant is NOT closed...  just a bit tricky to find behind Talbot's off P-M Road. Our party of 5 went here on a Tuesday night (2-19-14) and had excellent service. The freshly made salsa and chips are bottomless and free. It always takes a while to scan through the menu because of so many selections beyond the typical combinations offered everywhere. El Veracruz has menu items you will not find elsewhere... I am still exploring the menu and finding dishes that I still marvel how good they were days later. This visit I had the "CHORI-POLLO" and will be going back soon to have it again! Anyone who likes grilled chicken, chorizo, and wraps using flour tortillas will enjoy this selection. Comes with the usual tasty Mexican rice and beans, but the mix of chorizo sausage, grilled chicken, and cream sauce if a delightful surprise. Served with four steaming tortillas to make wraps (similar to fajitas)... so delicious that words cannot do it justice.
Another in our party tried the "pollo adobe" (which was my other possibility for the evening) and declared it to be wonderful. Moreover, El Veracruz is STILL the only Mexican restaurant that I know of offering so many delicious steak entrees under $20. The specialty burritos they offer are all stunningly presented and delicious as well!

If you like wraps or fajitas, do yourself a great favor and go here for the "CHORI-POLLO" which is still deliciously on my mind 5 days after having it.

 FWIW... this is the second year in a row that I've chosen El Veracruz to go out with a few friends celebrating my birthday.
