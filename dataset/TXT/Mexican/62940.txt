aXRrMXXoAN7lawHICgmsxw It was our first time in this part of Phoenix. We were just passing by and didn't even have a chance to check on Yelp for any references about this place. So, our opinion was not affected by any one or anything. Place has very urban dwelling industrial vibe. We were seated in the backyard. There is a kitchen in the back which is made out of shipping container. But do not take me wrong: there is nothing tasteless about this place. As the matter of fact every single detail and corner was thought through. Even bathroom has absolutely groovy details and fixtures. 
Service: friendly, accommodating and very fast.   There were customers that were obviously return customers. They would order food right away without even looking at the menu.
So, we didn't know what we are getting ourself into and took a leap of faith. My hubby ordered RoRo burger, my daughter ordered shrimp and chips, I ordered TJ Tacos and Cold Soba Salad. 
All portions were great size. Just a salad for me would be plenty, we splinted. TJ Tacos between all of us because I just couldn't eat everything myself :)
Everything was very very very fresh and flavorful. We are definitely coming back! See my photos. You will not be able to resist it. Great find on our part! Great lunch. See my other review for the coffee shop next door to this place. Also worth your time and attention.
