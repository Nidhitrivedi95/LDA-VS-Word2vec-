G6BwYw_0_atLPTzI1uokIA Woke up with a desire for margaritas and decided to come here.  Few more days left as a Vegas local (I'm a crazy gypsy who likes to move around) and I couldn't leave without coming to Nacho Daddy! The Mango margarita was excellent and so were the spicy shrimp nachos .  Thanks to the bartender, Zack for the awesome recommendations!
