VBVqHnViRLSYAqP7v8iNNQ Worst service ever! The food was delicious but from the hostess to the bus boys to the waitress and to the manager, it was horrible. We waited for 20 minutes before ever being offered a drink and that was only after we demanded a manager. The food took very long to ever come. The bus boys do not have any clue how to remove a empty plate or fill a water glass. And the manager took care of our immediate upsetness but never came back to check if it continues to go well or continue to be bad. And at the end when I told her it was horrible she basically rolled her eyes and said Oh. We will never return
