Rmiv34SGRqJDm_5Db29IrQ There are very few decent choices anywhere near the base so Yelp helps. I ordered 2 tostadas after seeing a review. The chicken one was amazing! Crisp shell, moist meat, tasty cojita (I think). The carne asada was way to wet. I mean there was liquid in my container. The flavor was we decent but the soggy shell was a big distraction. I say definitely go for the chicken, it is a chicken place after all. By the was the seem to have the cheapest carne asada fries in town at just $6.
