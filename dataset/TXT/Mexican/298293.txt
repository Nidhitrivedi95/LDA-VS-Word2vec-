ZJdOOIubTizd1eqECkeK-Q When that guacamole came out much sooner than anticipated and was rather smooth with nothing in the way of avocado chunks, cilantro, onions or tomatoes, I knew that disappointment was just a mile ahead. Prepared guacamole can be purchased, after all. In bulk. In...buckets. 

At least the maize tortilla chips I used to scoop up the malachite baby food were passable. 

The runny, watery salsa was not, however. Hell, I coulda had a V-8! Actually, I think I did, but it was poured into a rustic ceramic bowl and called salsa. 

Onto my entree, Combo #30: The mealy ground beef that filled my burrito and enchilada was fit for cats. Stray cats. The corpse of a chalupa was found buried under shredded lettuce with a tomato wedge acting as a headstone, its cause of death believed to be lameness. 

Kay's dessert, a serving of flan, was whale meat laced with caramel and vanilla extract. 

Redemption almost occurred in the churros. Served with vanilla ice cream, the ribbed cinnamon/sugar crusted sticks of fried dough contained an apple filling, one that was a bit too tidy, leading me to suspect that they came from a box, even if they were the 2nd brightest moment of our Memorial Day lunch, the 1st being Kay's Black Bean Soup that when paired with the white rice became a hearty, tangy meatless stew. 

Our server was cheery and friendly, and GA's decor is funky and whimsical enough to make it a decent enough spot for a few drinks if bar-haunting is something you enjoy, but damn, this just wasn't worth the drive. A take-over by Mad Mex would be a marked improvement, and I say that with absolutely no sarcasm aimed towards the local chain of which I am fond. Why Gran Agave garners more favorable reviews than Mad Mex boggles my brain and palate.
