OJAGq2tKzlwNuWmUX00I5g Ordered a chicken taco, beef taco, tostada, bean burrito, chips. Paid 22.00. Chicken taco very small and tasteless/oily, same with the beef, pathetically small portions, no flavor, tostada had soggy lettuce and no cheese to speak of. Presentation very poor. Unfortunately once again coming from California, Arizonans don't know Mexican food if they rate this as high as they do. I would have better off going to Del Taco even though I wouldnt.
