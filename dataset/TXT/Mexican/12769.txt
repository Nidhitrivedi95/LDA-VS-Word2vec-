0fyxLMASE5bfYAgW6MYM_g I've been here coming here since the place opened, although not nearly as much as I once did. I met a couple of clients today at Top Shelf, not my choice or I'd would of offered another suggestion. 
I agree with the large majority of previous comments and highly agree that this place needs to be closed down, renovated, professionally cleaned and reopened under new management.
