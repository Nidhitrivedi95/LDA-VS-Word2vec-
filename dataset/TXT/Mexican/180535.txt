n6u8lDrWBYkis8EQTwgOyA Went to this place for cinco de mayo, and I know I know if you are reading this you are probably thinking of all the places in Vegas why would you go there for cinco de mayo!? Lol long story short we went here and we were basically on a hunt for the best deal for tacos. They had a cool deal it was basically 5 bucks for 5 tacos which I don't think you can really beat. Here's the catch though.... You had to buy a drink booooo! Right? So then your total still came out to about 8 bucks. Anyways I had a plan I was going to try their adovada, carnitas, and of course the classic favorite carne Asada. Unfortunately they didn't have adovada so I stuck with the other two.  The lady at the counter was semi friendly, it's as almost she didn't want to be there or if I was asking her for too much. Anyways their salsa bar was impressive! They had probably over 8 different salsas there and since I'm a salsa freak I had to try them all, which probably was pissinn people off because I had a lady breathing down my neck heavily lol. Reason for not giving this place 5 stars is simply this: the cashier girl was not friendly and the place was kind of dirty, I don't think anyone cleaned or touched the salsa bar all day! And even robertos taco shop does that!!! How did the tacos taste you ask? They were actually really good. Had the other things have fallen into place I would have easily given this place 5 stars. I could see myself coming back to this place maybe on a day that wasn't so busy such as cinco de mayo :)
