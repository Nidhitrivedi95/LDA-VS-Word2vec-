UJb1PrUWDFfuzwUPc1pP4Q I will never come here again. They continue to discriminate, and be prejudice towards people to maintain a certain look. It is absolutely ridiculous and disgusting the way they treat people, especially now being in 2016. Just another place that gives Mill a bad name. I will never be a customer here in the future and will encourage everyone I know to do the same.
