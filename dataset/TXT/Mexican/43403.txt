7GGJlp1aWfcXGQz6q7SkXQ Do not come here!!!! Came in with a party of 11, during lunch time, not busy at all.  We got moved tables three different times, finally put our drink order in with our waitress, .....then crickets for 30 minutes.... Finally had a new waitress come over with a tray of a few drinks, had to re-order several of the drinks... The new waitress had a serious attitude and told proceeds to tell us that our waitress had completely just walked off the job, and that basically she's doing us a favor taking our order....um wow okaaaayyyy... The manager is standing by the bar doing absolutely nothing... Off she goes to the bar to put in our order of 6 more ice teas and cokes... Or whatever the simple order was... I even walked up to the bar after waiting so long for a cold glass for my beer...Another 15-20 minutes go by and she finally comes back and still doesn't have all the drinks...unbelievable... And remember we are getting attitude the entire time... We all decide we will not be dining there, I ask for my tab and she brings the entire check, ATTITUDE HUGE now, manager still doing nothing... The check for watered down ice teas ice melted, and one warm beer is $42!!!! No one did anything to let our party know about the waitress issue or even offer to pick up the ice teas which cost them about .10 cents... The waitress was the worst, the manager is useless, and all they wanted wS their $42 + tip for ice teas!!!!!!      In my opinion being in Vegas a million times being at dive bars to the most elegant, .... This place is by far the worst experience I have EVER had in Vegas in my entire life!!!!!!!!!
