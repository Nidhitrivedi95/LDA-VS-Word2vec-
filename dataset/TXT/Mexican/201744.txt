plHKBwA18aWeP-TG8DC96Q Finally got around to stopping by their new location for a weekday lunch, which admittedly is one of the best times to come without having to wait. I was a little confused upon arriving as they had, what seemed like, 3 hostesses around the entrance. The place was much larger than I expected but we quickly got a seat in the middle of the restaurant.

As others had suggested, we started with the queso which was delicious, as were the homemade chips. Large portion too.

I went with the Chicken and Brisket tacos for lunch which were good, although not as good as I remembered them from their Homestead days. Brisket was perfectly tender but incredibly salty during this trip - just a very overpowering taste.

I was tempted to try their mac n cheese as well, but maybe next time.

Waitstaff was pleasant but I don't understand the use of technology for technology-sake. Instead of discussing the menu and having a conversation, our waiter had his eyes fixed to his iPad for the entire ordering process. I'm sure it makes things easier for their cooks, but it added no value to the customers IMO.
