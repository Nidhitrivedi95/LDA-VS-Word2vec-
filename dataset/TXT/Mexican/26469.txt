3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ Pros: atmosphere is just great - this restaurant is inside of an old Methodist Church complete with painted ceilings, beautiful light fixtures, and stained glass windows. It's always very clean and the employees are very nice. Food is amazing, and never disappoints. I highly recommend their veggie tacos and the street corn!

Cons: long wait (but well worth it) also, its located in a more run down area of the city.

I recommend this restaurant to everyone!
