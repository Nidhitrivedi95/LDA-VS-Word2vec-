34PMhyoSQHVd4Lr7slzUcA So I started coming here because my bf loves this place.... Well he started to love this place after all those health code issues at Chipotle which used to be his favorite. 

Anyhow, everytime I've been here, it has been clean and with all those windows is always bright and feels cheerful to me. So I give them a (5/5) for the ambiance. :)

Service is mostly good but then again I've never come when it's busy.  Actually it never does seem busy even if I do come at normal dinner times. I guess that's a good thing for me! Lol. But it off the numerous times I've been here.... There have been a few times with bad service where the staff was just very inattentive. (4/5)

The food to me is very much chipotle style. U get in a line and you order what you want and then u get to watch them make your dish.  Overall it's a decent place. The flavor of the chicken is off and on.  Sometimes it is so very flavorful and other times it's a little on the bland side. I guess it depends of who is seasoning it and grilling it. :/. There have been a few times where they have run out of ingredients at around 7 pmish.... Not sure how you could run out of crispy taco shells.  They have also run out of brown rice on occasion.... So minus 1 star for not stocking food items properly. Minus .5 star for inconsistency.  The Zalapeno balls are yummilicious! I get them everytime i go. It's got a crispy skin and the flavor of the jalapeno mixed with the potato is so delicious in the creamy center!! (3.5/5)

Overall am I going to return.... That would be a positive as....uuummm... Read my opening line....my bf loves this place. Lol it's decent and the zalapeno balls are delicious and my favorite thing on the menu! :)
