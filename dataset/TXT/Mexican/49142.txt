8L8QlR4XJeAblTKCqoDP0A Decades ago Taco Bell was walk up only with some outdoor tables and a big gas fire blazing in the center of the patio. Bull River Taco reminds of those care free days. It is right off Rt 51 with a covered area enclosed by railroad ties.  There is no place to eat so everything is to go. I tried a pork taco and a spicy beef taco. My favorite was the pork possibly because it is shredded while the beef is ground. The tortillas are also very good.  My drive time back to my house was about 20 minutes. The tacos were still hot and the tortillas still intact. At $3 each, this made for an inexpensive & delicious dinner.
