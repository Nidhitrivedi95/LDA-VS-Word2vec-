WaXJWOQOPMEtGvRDFHma6g I loved my experience there ! 
The owner, who was very friendly, explained the menu since it was our first time there. We tried the Paloma drink (very sour!) and the mexican-style beer which was definitely an experience!
For the food, guacamole is out of this world and my sopa azteca was warm and delicious. My boyfriend tried the stuffed eggplant and the pepper which were both delicious ! 
I can't wait to go back and try more stuff. 
It takes a while to receive the food, so do not go there if you're in a hurry. But it's like you're a guest in a Mexican family and they're cooking a delicious meal for you.
