vjhB95c5nOXflNoyq_jKzw Took the family here on  Friday night. I ordered the Fiesta nacho meal. It was really good. They have something for everybody food wise. They have nahos, sandwichs to steaks... Our waitress was nice and I could see this place being in our family dinner rotation. One more thing they are more expensive then the average restaurant but you do get a much more food. A specialty order of nachos can easily feed two people so in a way could be a better value.
