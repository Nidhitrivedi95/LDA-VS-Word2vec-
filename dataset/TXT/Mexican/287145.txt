ybFJUdRaN4eCff-W3HHiEw We have been twice to this restaurant. The first time I would have given them a higher rating. The menu is limited and seems to be evolving into a "Mexican Tapas" place. While this may work for their food truck it doesn't seem to work as well in the restaurant. The food is tasty however not outstanding.  There are other better choices in the area. Service was spotty. The Waitress seemed to have too many tables on the second visit.
