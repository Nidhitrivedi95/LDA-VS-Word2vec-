SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA I'm not a local, but I found this place as it was recommended by a buddy. It's a little ways off the strip, but totally worth the venture. Portions are very good, and quality of food was excellent. Service was above expectations.  Each person I encountered seemed very concerned with my groups experience. All of us enjoyed our meals. Between us we have chips/salsa/bean dip, soups, chile Colorado, fajitas (chicken and steak), and some really yummy looking tacos.  I tried both, the corn and flour tortillas with the meal and they were also a good compliment. I didn't drink as I went for lunch so unfortunately I wasn't able to rate the margaritas.  Highly recommended.
