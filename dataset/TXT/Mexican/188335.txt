o6Yor6ofIw2TqM3mN28Kzg I've been coming to Tacos El Asador ever since I moved to the Annex 4 years ago. If there is one thing on the menu that is my go-to item, it would be the chicken tamales!  For such a simple meal, it is so flavourful! It's served with a very spicy salsa and jalapenos and onions.

My other favourites include the black bean soup and the chicken soup, both of which are available in sizeable portions, served with fresh homemade tortillas and avocadoes. 

Smokey always takes order with a smile on his face regardless of how arrogant customers can be. An attitude like that makes all the difference in having repeat customers!

The only downside is that this place is not equipped to handle groups as it is quite small and narrow, making it more ideal for takeout. Thankfully, Christie Pitts park is nearby for an impromptu summer/fall picnic!
