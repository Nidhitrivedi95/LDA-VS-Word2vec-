IyrDnrvUKpndj5zIv1KvGQ We wanted Mexican food on our last night in Vegas so we came here. It's not far from downtown. The margaritas here are the best I've tasted in Vegas, finally a margarita with tequila! I ordered the chicken fajitas and my wife had a couple of chicken tostadas. The food portions were huge and filling. We enjoyed our dinner here and would gladly come back again. If you need a margarita fix then try this place. The places on the strip suck!
