QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA My husband and I went to this place after he found it on Yelp. It's a little difficult to find since it's behind the miracle mile shops. Once we entered we were in for a treat! We decided to sit at the bar since it was football Sunday. We were greeted right away by the bartender. Toop notch service. Every bartender, food runner and barback always stopped to make sure you were taken care of. I got the hot buffalo nachos and my husband got the filet mignon nachos, both were excellent! I will definitely return here my next trip to Vegas.
