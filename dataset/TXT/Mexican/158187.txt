KNPvcLtzAUi_KkKBd69KuA This place has come a long way from what it used to be. The previous business was called Guacamole and it was awful! The place was ragged, food was basic and the service was the worst of my life.
But not this place has completely changed! The inside has been redone to be a little more up to date and the staff is on top of it! Our server was incredibly nice and our food came out quick.
We had skinny margaritas, and I order the Mexican tacos. Which were great. The meat was well cooked and they gave plenty! Also I love the salsa verde they give on the side. Their chips and salsa is really good too, a nice sweet not too chunky salsa. I always say the chips and salsa is an important intro to any Mexican place. You just have to have that be a good start. It's literally your bread and butter, and this place passes! 
We started off with queso and it's your standard white queso but that's exactly what I wanted! They have plenty of hot sauces on the table.
My one complaint which I won't let it effect the score is the margarita wasnt that strong. It's almost $12 and it's huge but was weak. They should put atleast 2 shots in this drink and it's maybe one.
