aXRrMXXoAN7lawHICgmsxw Absolutely love this place! Any time I have a meeting DT I schedule it around having lunch here! The skewers, veggie and fish tacos are all AMAZING! I love sitting at the counter and chatting with the chefs. The staff is so warm and welcoming, you get the opportunity to talk to everyone. The space is small with a great patio. I cannot wait to try everything on the menu. Oh and they have Happy Hour all day!
Please open is south Scottsdale ASAP!!
