Bf2fuqWbHd3L-X69FSMvmg I used to sit on the sidelines, watching Zack S mow down a plate (or sometimes 2) of these famous El Pastor tacos. He would moan and glisten with sweat and tremble slightly. I now realize this sounds like I'm describing the symptoms of food poisoning, but it's because he was in food bliss.

One day I decided to join in on the fun. I ordered the Quesongo  (mushroom) tacos, which come nestled together like 5 wee bear cubs my plate. And then I destroyed them. 

The guacamole is decent, but the tacos - based on my experience and Zack S' - are to kill for. I had tacos at a different place last night and wanted to throw my plate off a bridge in disgust. It's not that they were inedible - they just paled in comparison. 

So, 5 stars based on one plate. All you need is a moment to know that you're in love.
