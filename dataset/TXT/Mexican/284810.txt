y0phdNciJfDRahaIpoqKkg This Carl's Jr. franchise is one of the better ones.  First of all, product is everything and Carl's Jr. has a reputation for making a great burger.  And the success of any franchise depends on how the crew executes.  The crew here on Northern have never failed me.  Their burgers are always fresh and their fries are delivered hot, and if you can do that you're well on your way to harvesting good customers.  And whose morning is not made better by one of Carl's Jr biscuit sandwiches?  Carl's makes the best biscuit in town...no other fast food chain even comes close.  And finally, being a military retiree, and on a fixed pension, I'm grateful that Carl's Jr gives me a ten percent discount.  Friendly crew, good food...who can ask for more?
