vw6WWSFqJmeeQr-MUpAMUg Stopped at Don Tortaco tonight on my way home from work. I ordered the #5 2 tacos with rice and beans. I asked for the tacos to be on a soft shell. I recently had some dental work and the hard shells are too hard to chew. The cashier confirmed that I wanted soft tacos. She gave my order to the cook. 

My order was ready quickly and I walked out the door. When I got home and opened the styrofoam box I noticed the tacos were on a hard shell. Grrrrrr! I decided just to deal with it because I was home and already in my PJ's and it's 3am. While trying to power thru the tacos, I noticed that one of them had a stick imbedded in the shell! I had to break the shell to get it out. It's a good thing I just got off work instead of just coming home from a night of drinking because I may not have noticed and I could have choked on that. It was very sharp!  I am very disappointed in the food. I will just go to Roberto's down the street instead.
