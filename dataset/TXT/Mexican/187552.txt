o1Pjim5n8xJjjAE_v4RiHA I've been excited to try your food since I saw you on under cover boss. What a bad experience in your store today. 

What's the point of having an APP if your company doesn't use it. And then because they don't take the APP I not only have to pay more but don't even get points now?

I honestly expected more.
