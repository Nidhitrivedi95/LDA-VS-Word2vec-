EvDUi_H6-JG3QfGWiInAlw I am giving this place 3 stars because the food was good. But man our server was the worst. I asked for white toast. She brought me sourdough. When i told her i asked for white she said they didnt have white. Their sourdough is their only white toast. Ok i like sourdough. That wasnt my problem but if i aaked for white tell me you dont have white when i ordered to begin with. Also in any restaurant you should never let yiur customers drinks go empty. My coffee was empty for some time. And when i say empty i mean comletely empty for my entire meal. She asked if i wanted a refil when she brough my check.  Again good food but service was horrible.
