gOBxVkHpqtjRRxHBIrpnMA Good Mexican fare in a fast food style without the fast food taste. I got a chicken burrito, which was incredibly huge and stuffed to the brim with beans, salsa, lettuce, and a corn medley. Their hot sauces come in mild or hot, but should be relabeled mild and milder. 

Good entertainment is sitting along the bar window and people-watch while enjoying your meal. 

Overall, tasty.
