-n1g9MdeG46v1-gzZ4ldvQ While eating a soft chicken taco I bit down on what appeared to be a chicken bone in a very hard piece of grissle. The result was upper and lower gum irritation and pain in both my right rear upper and lower teeth. Bad experience! Check out foreign objects that may be lurking in your food.
