bQ2uuNkOxgUQRM7Y7RJDXQ Stopped in for lunch and was really impressed!  The restaurant itself is very cute and different from many places.  I had to use the restroom when I first got there and it was immaculate!  
My friend and I both ordered the veggie burrito, not because we are vegetarian, but the description looked delicious!  When we got our plates we loved the presentation and how fresh everything looked.  The tortillas were fantastic, clearly they make them fresh at the restaurant.   We loved our meal and the service was great.  My friend liked it so much she ordered tacos to go to take home to her son.  
I will be be back again soon as I am anxious to try the nachos and tamales!!!
