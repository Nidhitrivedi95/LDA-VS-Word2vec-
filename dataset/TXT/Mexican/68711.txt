bMSiHjs2fbKbBNPyuTwhHA I only gave two stars because this restaurant has a great location near the river.  Food was tiny and bland.  We got approximately 6 chips with our salsa and quickly ran out with salsa to spare.  A carafe of margarita was 52$!!!  Service was slow.  Waiter screwed up our bill.  

I Do not recommend.
