DO5mQxiBOgHEznosjxvJXw So I'm usually not a fan of giving too many stars to a new restaurant. Of course they're going to be good, everyone's still motivated to make it great!

However, the food is the reason for the four stars.

My husband and I went to try Olivia's because he literally happened upon the place; it was political night though. There was an event, HIP. I'm all for politics, just not when I'm dining. We stayed though. There were three bartenders and the restaurant manager (an assumption) behind the bar, where we decided to sit and dine. They were all extremely attentive probably because they still wanted to make sure their regular patrons were getting tended to. I never had an empty drink!!

Now for the food, my favorite part. Husband got steak tacos, I got oxtail enchiladas. Both so incredible! Everything is fresh. Their verse sauce is homemade and the most delectable I've had so far in the Vegas valley. The oxtail meat was rich, however, a little greasy. Not bad though.

My husband's steak tacos must have been good because he didn't let me try any of them. The chunks of meat were size able for the small tacos. Overall, I'll go back. Minus the politics though.
