XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg This time I tried the smoke salmon sandwich and it was huge!! Although I still prefer the blue corn waffle I had last time, the salmon sandwich was really good. You could easily split it. It also is very "smokey" so if you don't like that sort of thing, don't get it! Cactus margarita was delicious as usual and it's my favorite margarita I've had.
