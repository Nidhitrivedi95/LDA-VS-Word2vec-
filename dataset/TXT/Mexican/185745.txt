The enchiladas, tacos, carnitas, fried ice cream are all delicious. All fresh made. Great friendly and enthusiastic service too. We are late eaters so we've arrived around 8:30-8:40 our last 2 trips there...no problem!  Always greeted with a pleasant smile and attitude. I am not a fan of the roasted pepper salsas, kinda the New Mexican Flavors, that most of the "Mexican" restaurants in he East Valley offer. Rio Rico has the more simplified, yet fresh and authentic flavors we like. We'll be bringing many a friend here.
