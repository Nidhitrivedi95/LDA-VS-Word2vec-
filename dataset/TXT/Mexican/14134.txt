0r1Ow0HYAAjU7oM_2ePN6g 4/5 times we've been here our order has been messed up. Got pork when I ordered beef, got guac when I asked for none, got flour torillas when I asked for corn... Something Everytime. Bullseye sauce is ranch and tasted sour last time I was there. Fly's flying around everywhere. Really wanted to like this place but they need to figure some stuff out.
