XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg When I arrived in Vegas from Oakland,  I tried to go to the Mesa Grill restaurant but never made it about 6 times.  I won a few thousand dollars from table games on a single night.  It made me feel good.  I deliberately decided where I wanted to eat out there for a supper that evening.  Oh, I forgot about the Mesa Grill.  Let me go there without having a hard decision to pick one of the most excellent restaurants in Vegas.  There are so many restaurants inside the Ceasers casino.  I walked all the way to the exact restaurant that I looked for.  It looked a whole woody decor inside the restaurant but it wasnt like a Southwest cultural influence. It's more like a woody cabin.  A Hispanic hostess greeted me to a table where I could sit down.  I looked up in a wine menu and looked for a glass of chardonnay from Napa. It wasn't available but was available for a bottle of chardonnay.  They have offered only white French wines for a glass.  I won't order a glass of French white wine.  I decided to skip it.

 I ordered: Tiger Shrimps with corn tamale -- well-done shrimps, along with tamale(crushed corn flours), and sweet corn sauce with red pepper sauce(mild-hot). 
And Cilantro Spice Chickens-- well-done chickens along mashed potatoes and cilantro sauce (sweet smoking spice flavor).  They are so delightful.  The breads included some pieces of jalapeño.  

I'll go back there again for different kinds of meat and seafood.  Any cost on a dinner menu is expensive.  This restaurant is nothing comparable to other Mexican or Southwest restaurants because a variety of the Southwest flavors is the top-secret recipes.
