ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA Visited La Comida this past weekend with my in-laws and half of us were happy with our experience and the other half not so much. 

They always made sure we had chips and salsa at the table. I ordered the Hamburgesa Mexicana and that was VERY delicious! 3 people at our table ordered the fajitas and that was kind of a let down. Not much meat for what you pay for. One person ordered the enchilada de pollo. He was kind of thrown off by the sweetness from the mole on top of it but really enjoyed it. 

The server was just okay. He did his job but just wasn't very personable. I loved the decor and the vibe of the restaurant.
