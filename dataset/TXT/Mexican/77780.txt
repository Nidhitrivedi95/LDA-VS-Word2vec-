cKgUCzMGuRgkbKXUsgeXUw The guacamole is awesome! It's handmade in front of you. I enjoy the cranberries they throw into it. I've been here twice. The second time with a group of friends from out of town. The location is great but otherwise we were not impressed with the food or service. The dishes were lacking flavor and there was nothing exciting. If you'd like to still try them out I'd check them out during their happy hour for Happy hour pricing.
