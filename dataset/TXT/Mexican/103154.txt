It's not really fair to call this a Mexican restaurant because that conjures up incorrect images for most people--this is not an independent Don Pablo's, this is modern fusion-y "Mexican" food that is simply delicious. 

I had a cucumber margarita there that was awesome, along with a scallop entree that was perfect. Goat cheese guacamole is pretty much too good to be true. 

I would probably eat here a few times a month if I could afford it, but it's more like a few times a year. It's not incredibly expensive but it's no normal night out either. I definitely recommend reservations though, this place always seems busy. Great service too!
