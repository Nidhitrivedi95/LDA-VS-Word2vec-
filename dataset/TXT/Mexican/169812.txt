Lycld8xZmrgbRJD4qDxgGA It has been a very long time since I found a really good Mexican place. I have definitely found my new favorite Mexican restaurant! The nachos with cheese were awesome, the taquito was awesome, the cheese quesadilla was awesome, and the Spanish rice was awesome! Service was super fast and the place is clean a nicely decorated, I will definitely be back to try more!!
