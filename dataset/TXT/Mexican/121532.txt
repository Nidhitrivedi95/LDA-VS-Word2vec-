h84tU6REsM1VzyUCP0Ss7Q I love Baja Fresh, and was really excited to have one so close to home. But the service is hit or miss. Some days you get lucky and get a nice and competent person, and then other days, not so much. 

They also have some strange ways of operating business. Their hours, for instance, are 10:45 - 9:45. Maybe it's just me, but I find it odd that a business would close at 9:45 instead of on the hour like all other Baja Fresh franchises. And when we have gone early in the day they have opened up to 15-20mins late. Also, once you're inside it's not the most comfortable wait since the AC is broken. Forget about eating in with the summer heat!

The food we've had here has been consistent with other locations, so I'll still go here out of convenience when I get the craving. But I do wish the ownership/management would do something to improve service. As it is now, you get the impression they really don't care all too much.
