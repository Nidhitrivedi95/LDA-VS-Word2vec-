XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg We are locals, and came down to the Strip for a celebration dinner.  Mesa Grill books up, so reservations are essential.  We arrived at our appointed time and were immediately seated.  We had a nice view of the open kitchen and serving window, so it was easy to spot some of the popular dishes as we were contemplating our order. The assistant waiter promptly came over and offered water. Then, the only hiccup of the evening.  It took 10 minutes for the waiter to stop by and greet us and take drink orders.  Service after that was just fine.

For $240 (inclusive of tax and a 20% tip), our party of two had:

3 really great margaritas.  they have 3 different varieties.  I had the one that was described as part tart, part sweet.  It was pink in color. Really good.

2 appetizers:  tiger shrimp tamale and lobster tacos.  both were outstanding.  as others have stated, the tacos are small.  however, when paired with a complete multicourse meal, they are perfect.

2 entrees:  veal chop and lamb chop.  both came with a side tamale, so we didn't order extra sides.  The veal chop may have been the best I've ever had.  Really delicious.  The lamb was very good, but not as outstanding as the veal chop.

1 desert:  shared the banana cream pudding.  It was good, but could have used a bit more banana flavor.

The atmosphere here can border on loud.  You are adjacent to the casino, and although the windows separating the restaurant from the casino are floor to ceiling, they have a louvered effect, so both sound, and sadly, cigarette smoke enter the restaurant.  The smoke is not too bad, but it is noticeable.

This was our second visit, the first being lunch.  Would definitely return again.  Just remember, for dinner especially, make a reservation!
