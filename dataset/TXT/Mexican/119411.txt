gtffarZ2Y_rLfCegMg-nqw Disappointed with this Chipotle. You're out of brown rice, the place wasn't that busy, I asked for no juice from your Pico de Gallo but she does the opposite, cashier doesn't even say hi, doesn't give me a tray, I have to ask for it and ask for my cups for drinks, doesn't say thank you. It was 6pm, your place is so dirty, overflowing trash,dirty tables. Terrible service from this restaurant. The guacamole was very bland, we didn't even finish it. Not eating again at this location.
