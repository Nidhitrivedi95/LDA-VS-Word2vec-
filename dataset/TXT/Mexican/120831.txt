h-Oq86DZfZad9kKXe8m7Lg This place is awesome and absolutely delicious!  Tonight we stopped in to have valentine's dinner they had the place decorated with lotts of love for Valentine's day. Our waitress Alondra was very quick kind and professional. Every few minutes she constantly asked if we needed anything and that to us is very important. I enjoyed the cheese enchiladas with rice and had to order beans on the side.  It was prepared differently than most mexican food places. It had mozzarella cheese inside on top it had lettice, avocado, mexican cheese and sour cream topped with home made  green verde salsa. I can tell it wasn't a frozen food its authentic.  They also have a very large selection of natural fruit drinks check out my photos of what drinks they have. Especially if your pregnant they have alot of delicious healthy drinks. Im definitely coming back to this place love the great customer service and how they make the food makes me wonder if this is how  people in Mexico prepare their food because its slightly different than filibertos, ponchos and so on. The restaurant is very clean and  nice.
