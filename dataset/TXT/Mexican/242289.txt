Te-BqwJZt8S0fu9ltlq3Eg Now I know most "mexican" restaurants are for the most part the same. Only thing I can say is that I really enjoyed my food. It really was so good that I will go out of my way just to have it again. I know this seems very vague but just go and order something. If you don't like it maybe only there vegetarian items are good....lol
