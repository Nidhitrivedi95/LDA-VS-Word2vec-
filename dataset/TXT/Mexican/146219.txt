JJe0yIYC_M3la1Qbm9i3UQ OK. First thing you need to know is that this place is in a fairly shady area of Cleveland - the first time I went there I was pretty sure my GPS had gotten me lost. But the place itself is nice, homey and pretty darned awesome!

Basically this place is a German Bar with cheap food! A Litre of beer costs you $6. Yes. A litre of Heffeweisen. Or Dunkel. Or an IPA. $6. Insane. 

And then there's the food. Taco Tuesdays where you have about 16 different types of tacos for a dollar each. Wing Wednesdays where you get tasty wings with a seemingly endless combination of dry rubs or sauces for about $2.50 (or is it $3?) a lb. And 75 cent Burger Thursdays. 

And to top it off, they have a old school jukebox, a pool table, a Table Tennis table and a coin operated mini bowling lane (which is frigging awesome)

No matter which day of the week you go to this place, you cannot go wrong.
