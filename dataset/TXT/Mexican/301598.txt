Zv71mk1Ysq56xHzY0MWzUQ I was craving tacos and decided to try this place on our way home from little league. To my surprise, they are officially the best chicken tacos I have ever had. Another bonus is they have a drive through. You really can't get any better than this place. Absolutely delicious!
