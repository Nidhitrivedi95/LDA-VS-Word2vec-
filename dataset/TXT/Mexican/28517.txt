3SLDrXzPmKF0iCY8WriLsA I will always recommend the chicken. The chicken is Amazing, I'm not a huge fan of the steak, but I'm not a fan of steak in general. But my bf loves the steak tho. I work in the plaza so it's a go to place for me, I have been disappointed once before but they were happy to fix my problems, the owner is a great guy, the staff is very friendly and accommodating to my picky needs. lol It's by far my favorite "Mexicali" place to go.
