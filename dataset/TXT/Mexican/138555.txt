iZfeH70e_YFLrURT8WuCYQ I have seen poor reviews for this restaurant on plenty of sites but have to disagree with them. I have been to El Rodeo twice now and have been very pleased every time. It is certainly the closest thing you will get to authentic Mexican food in the area. While the food is still very Americanized, it at least makes the attempt to appear and taste Mexican by easing up on the cheese sauces and odd taste combinations you find at other places in Cleveland.

I hail from southern Arizona, so Mexican food in the Cleveland area has generally been disappointing but El Rodeo is a place that I actually enjoy to go. The portions are very large and cooked well. As was noted in the other review, on the nights that the Mariachis are playing, it can get very loud but if you go on those nights, you are kind of asking for it. I actually quite enjoyed the music and my children were very entertained by it.

The atmosphere is bright and typical of what you'd see at any mexican place but I personally think it is cleaner and better taken care of than most. 

If you feel the craving for Mexican food in Cleveland, this is one of the few places that I would recommend (including the upscale ones).
