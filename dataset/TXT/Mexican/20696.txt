2aiaryk7kgUBhXhVu-9vHg I'd heard great things about Miros but I seem to be in the minority as there was no arriba moment for me. I'm fine with small cosy dining spaces but at a table for two we felt boxed in. Waiting staff were very distracted and all though we had a tight squeeze at our table it was not busy. The mains were ok but not strong on flavour and more what I would expect at a burger place throwing in a few tex-mex type dishes not a standalone Mexican restaurant. The guacamole was thin and at best inoffensive but the margaritas were woeful. In fact I kept asking for more wedges of lime and battered in with the salt (it was so sweet?!) to try and resuscitate it, but it had already shuffled of this mortal coil. Maybe we got them on an off night or with new staff but they'll be no hasta la vista for me.
