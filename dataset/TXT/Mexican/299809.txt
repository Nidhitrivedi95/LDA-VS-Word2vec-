ZLrDrRo1Vy03HJka4KVb9w I would have given no stars, but the waitress was very nice and food came promptly. BUT this place is by far the WORST "Mexican food" I have ever eaten! Granted I came from NY where almost every cuisine is yummy, but damn. Absolutely no flavor to anything. Even my margarita was watered down. I got huevos rancheros... It was just fried egg with plain fried rice and refried beans. Awful, no cheese, no pico, no salsa, no guac, no black beans and NO TORTILLA! How do they even serve such garbage. I will never return. Yuck!
