GETVAz5SCk8rFziexV54Aw Ok, I admit I tend to judge a book by its cover sometimes. Especially a restaurant. I'm so glad I didn't this time! I went with some friends last night and even though the reviews were good, I was skeptical. It was fantastic!! I ordered the Prickly Pear margarita and I'm still dreaming about it, it was that good. Plus it contained a generous amount of tequila (another reason I'm still thinking about it). Dinner for me was a shrimp quesadilla. Delish! Not covered in sauces and garnishes, simple and good with lots of shrimp. Others ordered carne asada tacos, different chicken dishes, everyone enjoyed. It's not fancy, it's not 5 star dining but really good, high quality, nice people and yummy margs. Check it out!
