So far, I've tried the chorizo and egg breakfast burrito and the carne asada burrito.  Both were very good, and under $10 for a large sized burrito.  I was very pleasantly surprised at this hidden gem in Scottsdale.  Give it a try for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or munchies in between.  I'll probably be there too.
