a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg It's my favorite Mexican place in LV, it's far from the strip and in the downtown area so not sure if you'll wonder here if you're new in town. The restaurant is near the Las Vegas North Outlet.

I like the rice mix with beef, I forgot which one it is, but every time I'm there I just ask for it.  Plenty of parking at the back of the restaurant and it gets crowded in the afternoon, all the locals come here for lunch.
