4VjrVv-PBuG-al5JnUUIGg We've had the pleasure of working with the taco man on two separate occasions. One was for a 60 person reunion and the other was for a 100+ person  reception. Easy to work with, affordable, and everyone raved about the tacos (made fresh to order). As the organizer, I didn't have to worry about the details as they brought everything needed including tables, napkins, silverware, and all the yummy fixings! Definitely recommend.
