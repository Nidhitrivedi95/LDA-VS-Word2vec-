JXiOlujB1i7aZvkNJ9xpzQ Just discovered this place for the first time while travelling - it was convenient to get to and right off the highway.  I had a seat at the bar and the tequila selection was very nice.  The interior is much nicer than I expected for a Mexican restaurant in the area.  Everything looked new and modern, unlike some of their competitors which are on the divey side.  The bartender and staff were very friendly and helped steer me in the direction of which tequila (herradura) and margarita I would like best.  They were both very good and I learned so much about tequila to help me order the next time!  My guacamole and tacos were also very good.  I can't say enough things about the experience and quality of the food and drinks, especially for the price.
