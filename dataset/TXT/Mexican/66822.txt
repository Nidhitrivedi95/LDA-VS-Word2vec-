Bf2fuqWbHd3L-X69FSMvmg I should've known better than to have Mexican food in Canada when I live in the Mexican food capitol of the U.S. - Los Angeles. 

My friend and I visited Toronto for the first time and after passing up on a bunch of great eateries in the Kensington Market, we hangrily decided to have Mexican. 

I had the alambres de pollo which is like chicken fajitas with melted cheese on top. They provide you with tortillas and you can make tacos out of the alambres. The alambres had a sweet after taste that didn't sit well with me. I hate mixing savory and sweet with my food unless it's Caribbean or Thai cuisine. This just didn't taste right. It wasn't disgusting but it wasn't good either. I had no choice but to finish up what I purchased because we were on a time crunch and couldn't grab anything else to eat. Prior to our meals, we had guac and chips, which was the only thing that was good. I also ordered a margarita. Okay y'all, save yourself some money and just buy a beer. The margarita tasted like a slushy. It was extremely sweet and had no alcohol. I couldn't finish it. They should just call it a Mexican slushy because margaritas aren't supposed to taste like that. 

My friend and I left full but unsatisfied. We should've known better than to have Mexican. Should've had Italian, Portuguese  or plain Canadian fare. Oh well. Never again!
