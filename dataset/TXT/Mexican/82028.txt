d_L-rfS1vT3JMzgCUGtiow My group went to this restaurant at the last second on a Friday night. Was looking up to get a table right away outside to listen to the music at the Mandalay Bay pool. Our waitress was very attentive and extremely knowledgeable of the menu also had great suggestions to give to the entire table. For myself I went and ordered the $55 all you can eat small plates course to say the least this was a fantastic move by myself. Everything I ate was extremely well prepared had many different flavors all flavors were very clean and all harmonize together in a certain way. I walked out of that restaurant absolutely stuffed but also knew that I tried several different items to get a feel of the entire menu. The bonus of having this meal was knowing that while I am paying a Vegas premium price I'm getting a premium meal. I would recommend this for anybody with a big appetite that is willing to try things outside of the box. Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anybody. Just keep in mind that you are paying for a Vegas meal on the strip so the prices will be inflated to Vegas pricing.
