403dr0KtTbRibcWEA7h0WA I pass by Ketzal's all the time on my way to Home Depot. It looks great from the road. 
My hubby had been to the bar but never ate there so one day coming home from Home Depot we stopped for lunch. 
We were told they had had a black out for a couple of hours but they were up and running except the computers. 
We we served chips in a cone shaped vessel with several dips. That gave me warm and fuzzies for a great meal to come. 
My hubby ordered the Burro Ketzal with shrimp and I ordered the Taco de Camerons. 
When I looked at my tacos, I was not sure what I was looking at but I could tell by the scent it was shrimp. The grilled shrimp were the 91/110 count and looked like larvae smothered in sauce. There was no cabbage as per the description only a sad ice berg lettuce next to the saturated tortillas. I was hungry, so what the heck, looks could be deceiving. I took a few bites and it was so salty stopped there. 
My husband bit into his Burro Ketzal and they same shrimp were in his as well. He said it was salty but the rice neutralized it a bit. He was not able to finish his either. 
I don't believe the power outage had anything to do with the quality of the meal so, we won't be going there again.
