XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Always wanted to try a Bobby flay restaurant and we did at mesa! This place is full of creative ingredients put together. We started with the gala apple salad with  blue cheese crumbles on the side. The salad has pomegranates which I don't think really works with the salad... and it needs more apples! It's an apple salad for goodness sakes haha. We also order the new Mexican pork tenderloin  with cauliflower gratin and it was goood.  Our server was great too!
