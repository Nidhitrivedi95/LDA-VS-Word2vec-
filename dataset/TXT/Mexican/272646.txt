It was just too big - and it made the portion look really small. It also made it hard to actually approach the food as the flap sort of sticks out into your chest as you're trying to get close. Having said that, I thought it tasted fine. It could have been a bit bigger (I am eating small portions these days and I expected to have leftovers but I didn't). Also as a tip, they do serve tap water in a cup, just ask for it. I didn't know that so I bought a bottle of water.
