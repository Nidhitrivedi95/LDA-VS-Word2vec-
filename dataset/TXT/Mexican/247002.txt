tXqaK0lBEE1XJbzDPsdFvg Quick Review:   The burger was pretty good, nothing amazing, but definitely better than say Carl's Jr. or Jack in the Box.  Not quite In n Out.  The Patty Melt was delicious and is served on rye bread with grilled onions as it should be.  The fries were average and a little soggy.  I was actually really excited about the onion rings because in the picture they look like they are crispy and flavorful.  They were neither.  Very bland, the breading was all falling off and they too were quite soggy.  I would go back to try try some of the other items on the menu because they have quite a selection of non burger items that look and sound delicious.  I forgive them on the onion rings, because I should know that what you get almost never looks like the picture.
