UUfioP3G4Qowm0x2HQlPtA First time and won't be my last. Place is very clean and the staff super nice. Was talking to the manager there and he's super chill. The food isn't too bad. I actually like the sweet habanero sauce. I will definitely come back and recommend to my coworkers lol thanks for the rewards card as well :)
