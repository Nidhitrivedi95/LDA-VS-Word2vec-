eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw After hearing they had some of the best nachos around, I knew my boyfriend and I had to stop here for dinner. We are nacho fiends!! We went around 8 at night. There was a good crowd but it was not too crazy. The service was not the greatest. It was incredibly difficult to find our waitress and order food. Once we finally did, it took 35 minutes to receive our food! We ordered the queso dip (which we asked to be brought before everything considering it is an appetizer), but it came with everything at the same time. Also, the three tables that were seated at least 15 minutes after us received their food far earlier than we did, which did not make sense. The queso was good, but only when it was hot. After that it had some sort of funky after taste. The kale salad was incredibly bland and disappointing. The fiesta nachos were okay but not anything close to what I expected them to be. Overall, we left nacho daddy with queasy stomachs and had to end our night there. Definitely not how you want to spend Vegas.
