e4NQLZynhSmvwl38hC4m-A Heard about this place for a couple years and finally got around to trying it--man, wish I'd tried it earlier because it's delicious and very affordable. Been back several times already. Recommend the tacos (carne, pollo and birria), Crazy Potato and salsa bar. BYT is a small place that gets crowded at peak lunch/dinner times, but the wait is never that long. Inside seating is very limited so be prepared to sit on outdoor patio if during peak times.
