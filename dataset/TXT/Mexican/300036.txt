zMdpFu7hpvrHChR7H2XCfA All I can say is we have a problem. There is something in their cheese sauce and re-fried beans that have made us addicted. This place has become a 1 time a week stop for us. Sometime even twice if we're feeling lazy or just have the craving. The beans alone keep me going back. I've tried to replicate them at home and can't even touch it. They are putting something extremely unhealthy or something extremely illegal in them. It doesn't stop at the sides mind you. They put just as much love in their entrees. Our go-to dishes are enchiladas verdes, fire burrito, the pork burrito, chimichangas and fish tacos. Meat is always very tender. (Get the shredded over the grilled though)
Now yes this is a Mexican restaurant catering to our American needs. And because it took over an Ihop building, it doesnt feel at all like a Mexican restaurant. Although you'll find the Most Interesting Man In The World greeting you with a sombrero on his head.... But the menu is still nice, and the food has yet to disappoint.

P.S.... $15 PITCHER WEDNESDAY AND SATURDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
