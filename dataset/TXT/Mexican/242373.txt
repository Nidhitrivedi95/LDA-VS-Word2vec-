Only reason why I took away one star is because unless you get there shortly after they open you will more than likely encounter a loooong wait time. A small hallway is the only place you can wait to be called and it smells kind of stuffy in there. Bar area is a great idea with a jukebox and two tvs but the environment can get kind of loud and ghetto. There was one time where we were caught in between a bar fight so we've strayed away from being seated at the bar.
