dbKnvc3eAugC-vRxw03Jzw If you are paying with cash, make sure you are getting the correct amount back. The lady at the drive thru tried giving me just my change and keeping the two dollars. When asked about it she didn't even open the register, she just gave me a snarky attitude and handed the two dollars back. I know it was only two dollars but makes me think, who else is she pulling that with but getting away with it? Just be careful..
