oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ We stumbled upon Chayo in the Linq while wandering the strip looking for breakfast on a recent trip. We thought about trying Hash House A Go Go, but the line to put in your name was 10 minutes long, so we checked out their menu and ended up here instead - and we were thrilled! I had the green scramble ($14, green chili pork, tomatillo sauce, spinach, jalapenos, guacamole and cheese), and it was REALLY good. So good, in fact, that I suggested going back the following morning to have it again! 

All of our food was really good with the exception of one item - the chicken tinga skillet was SO salty my friend could only eat a little bit of it. 

Our waitress was great, too - giving us thoughtful opinions of the menu and her recommendations - and even after her area was switched to a different part of the restaurant, she was on it and never left us hanging. 

It was a great spot for a hearty, reasonably priced breakfast.
