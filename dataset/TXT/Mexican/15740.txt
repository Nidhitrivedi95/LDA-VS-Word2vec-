The shrimp cocktail comes with chips and saltine crackers with a lime! The burrito is so amazing! It's so delicious! The staff were really amazing and patient and caring and sweet! Their service was pretty fast! My sisters and I were in and out of there in less than an hour. It's clean and it's a really chill place to have lunch and dinner regularly
