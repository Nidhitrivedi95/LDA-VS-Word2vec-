ZCe93zAkxr2KOBU1NT0lmg This restaurant has been one of my family favorites for a couple decades now.  They have speedy & appropriate customer service, flavorful food, and multiple different types of atmospheres that fit your needs. 
There is the dining area and the indoor/outdoor bar. The bar can get pretty upbeat and busy! 
I am pretty sure you have to call a day in advance to make reservations for big parties. I would recommend this, because its typically busy every night of the week. 
Their margaritas are, of course, phenomenal.
