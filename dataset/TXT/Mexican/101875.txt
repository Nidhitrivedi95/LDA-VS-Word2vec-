evNdyHPR1B8E1aIoUAsGrQ Quite possibly the worst Chipotle in America. Line usually has 10-15 people in it at most hours, but don't expect to get your food in less than 10 minutes. I've waited more than 40 minutes at this location before, when there were less than 20 people ahead of me. The staff is extremely unprofessional and lackadaisical. They are constantly talking to each other and taking breaks every few customers. When they are actually doing their jobs, they work at a deliberately slow pace. On several occasions, they have also run out of certain meats. I'll take Chipotle over Qdoba 9 times out of 10, but this particular one really tips the scales in the opposite direction, especially when their is a Qdoba one block away.
