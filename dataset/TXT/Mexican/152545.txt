Jy40ercZIQaNcz2qV3qgow Worst freaking Mexican food I've ever tasted! Ordered a torta and it was so simple. The bread wasn't even a torta bread! It only comes with the steak and cheese everything else like beans is extra cost. The service here was ridiculous. We were the only people in the restaurant and it took 35 min for our food. Servers didn't even come and ask us if we wanted refills on our drinks. 
Sucky sucky place!
