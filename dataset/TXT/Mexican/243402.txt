thLX_k20SPJ0KyusGTBIHw I can't believe this place. My sister and I ordered food for carry out: one taco, one burrito, and the brussels sprout nachos. After sharing the nachos, I was full, so I saved my burrito for the next day. I ordered the breakfast burrito without bacon because I am a vegetarian. They didn't put bacon in the burrito, but the did add giant pieces of chicken in it and now I can't eat it. This was my first time trying Diego Pops and now I don't know if I can trust this restaurant.
