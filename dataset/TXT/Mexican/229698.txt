SEjyjYlMfFFzkHaru6JadA Very very dissapointed
I bookmarked this location & have been asking my husband to bring me here for the longest time & he finally did last night. Atmosphere was nice & quiet the service was ehhh ok 
I was very very dissapointed with the food & my husband felt sick after he ate. 
When our food was brought out the plates were hot but my food wasn't as hot, that I don't like. I ordered a beef enchilada & chili relleno & was so dissapointed (I've tasted better) it was very disappointing my chili relleno was very bland no taste at all $13.00-14.00 for a 2 item combo is RIDICULOUS!! Especially because the portions are very small for the expensive price paid.
My husband ordered a chili Colorado burritos & had to pay $1.00 extra for all meat because he didn't want all the beans which he ended up getting anyway his plate was about $15.00-16.00 which is RIDICULOUS!! 
$40.00 for 2 people & I didn't even order a drink is sad. We were better off going to a little taco shop or Roberto's up the street. Very dissapointed we won't be going back
