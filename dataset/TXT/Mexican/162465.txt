l2rcGJSpfTO9-dV8MdFmkA This was my first experience at Fat Bastard, and I was very happy with the service and food. The menu is limited to burritos, quesadillas, and sides. I ordered a Huge chicken burrito to share, and chips and salsa. The toppings were plentiful, from beans to rice to guacamole to pico de gallo, and everything seemed quite fresh, and the chicken were large, tender, white meat pieces. I was very happy with my meal, and the quantity was more than enough for two ladies at lunch. You can eat in, take out, or have the food delivered.
