tNJgmbODR-N0qdPGy4Vsrw I *heart* mexican food. El Jalapenos does it well enough. Okay, so its only 3 blocks from my home -- that doesn't mean I'll give it unfair wager. In fact I don't go there much because ... well... I can't eat out all the time and am usually on the move away from home when eating out. Okay ... back to the mexican food. 

El Jalapenos first of all has really great atmosphere. They keep the lighting at the perfect level to be able to notice all of the decor and color spread throughout the restaurant. Also since there are only a few windows near the front of the establishment, the dining experience remains uninterrupted by the bustle of Lakewood on 117th St. It feels like I can escape to El Cardon for the afternoon or evening. 

Chips and salsa on the table for good measure as with any Mexicano joint. These ones are good, and I usually get spicy salsa or mix the habanero sauce in with the regular. 

Menu is a full-on mexicano menu as you would see at many other popular restaurants. Enchiladas verdes are usually my first pick. Always a staple item for me. The Grande Burrito is actually very impressive! Think 12in flour tortilla filled with fresh meats and vegetables, creamy sauce and sour creme. Nothing incredibly special just grande deliciousness. I've also heard their fajitas were pretty much spectacular but I'm not much of a connoisseur in that area. 

Service is quick and personal. I have occasionally found a slow waiter during a lunch hour when I had to eat and run but they're usually pretty good about it. Prices are average. A dinner for two with drinks would probably run you $28. Take a trip there. I like it. You might too.
