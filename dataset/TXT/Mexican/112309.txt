I wish they offered a smaller portion of their nachos during happy hour sometimes you dont want a massive mound of food at $10.95 a plate. I ordered the bbq chix nachos which my friend warned me not to order because they are a bit robust. They arrived and she was not wrong - there was too much going on on the plate. The bbq sauce was overpowering and salty, the cheese sauce got lost under everything and just coated your mouth, the onion strings were salty and the chicken was salty. I suppose it came out as it should have but i make these at home minus onion strings and never get this kind of intense flavor. I wouldn't order them again. My friend ordered the hamburger nachos which were an odd flavor combination but good. My other friend ordered the fish and chips which tasted of old smelly fish. We blame him for ordering that in a restaurant that serves nachos, but not sure why thats even on the menu. 

The service was great, quick and friendly. They have a pretty varied menu to choose from if youre not a fan of nachos. I love nachos but will stick to my real Mexican restaurants to satisfy my appetite.
