Ok9vikKusbG_Ue9pJf6s3Q If there's one simple food everyone loves it is a taco. Starting a taco joint may seem easy, but it takes attention to detail to really perfect the taco. La Capital - in the middle of Montreal and, funnily enough, Chinatown - has chosen to pay attention to detail and is rewarded with some marvelous little tacos. The al pastor is TRUE al pastor, meaning it's cooked on a spit. As a Texan who lives in a jungle of mexican restaurants, finding one that cooks al pastor the true way is surprisingly difficult. It says a lot to put al pastor on your menu and then not cheat!!

The salsas were tasty, the juice of the day is very authentic to mexican cuisine, and the space is small but refined in that taco joint kind of way. No maître d, just some good food in a great city.
