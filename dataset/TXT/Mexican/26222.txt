Conceptually, Taco Guild is really cool. It's an old church converted into a modern day eatery. The interior is dope because it still retains the old stained glass pertinent to the church. 

The food. Meh. Meh. Meh.

My sister and I both did taco plates where you can order 3 tacos and get a free side and/or tack on a street corn for $2.50.

We ordered the following tacos:

-al pastor pork ($3.95): grilled pork, jalapeño bacon + pickled red onion
-urban bean coffee braised beef ($4.95): caramelized onion, mango jicama relish, Cotija cheese
-Yucatan shrimp ($3.95): green cabbage slaw, avocado
-chipotle cherry steak ($4.95): poblano straws, chile aioli, bleu cheese
-peking duck ($4.95): plum sauce, fire-roasted poblano apricot compote, Brie cheese
-tropical ono (($4.95): menonita cheese, roasted-tomato salsa, coconut slaw, mango, tomato, cilantro

The good: the coffee braised beef + Yucatan shrimp - good flavor and fluid in taste.

The okay: the al pastor + cherry steak - good, but not memorable. The bleu cheese on that steak taco was no bueno because it basically overpowered the steak.

The bad, bad: the peking duck had this congesting aromatic flavor after every bite. It was overwhelming and unappetizing. The ono also bordered on gross because the coconut slaw was a bit too sweet and too much.

The real downer? The corn. Our corn was overcooked or something because it possessed an unsavory dark yellow tint, which we thought was odd. After shaving the corn off and mixing it with the condiments, it was inedible - pretty gross. My sister justified it by saying that perhaps corn was no longer in season?, but after glancing at other tables, our corn was clearly an anomaly - other people had normal looking corn.

We're from LA., so 5 dollar priced tacos are digestable, but if I'm paying that much for a taco, the ingredients better be top notch. And, be forewarned - the tacos are substantially much smaller than they photograph.
