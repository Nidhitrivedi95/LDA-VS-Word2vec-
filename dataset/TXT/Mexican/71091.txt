C2BR0TjNacoNzItPLUHTAA So the wife and I came here for lunch last week as the sign (love coconut, and fish tacos) drew us in from Scottsdale road!  Loved the little surf board style tables they had.  We ordered at the counter and got Two fish tacos and an order of calamari and chips.

Fish tacos were amazing, the fish it's self was cooked perfect, moist and flaky!  Top that with a coconut milk slaw and a fresh mango salsa and mmmmmmm!  The calamari and chips was good, but the calamari were shaped like long and thin fish sticks which was new.

OK so why the 5 star rating?  Well, in 2014 I rediscovered something I thought vanished from the face of the earth long, long ago...CUSTOMER SERVICE!  Eddie (sorry if I forgot or misspelled your name)  was outstanding, he saw to our every need and made sure everything was good, never had to wait or ask twice.  He was very polite.

After finishing our meal and boxing up our food he walked with us to open the door as well.  I had parked right in front of the door, so when we got in our vehicle the cylinder lock had jammed up and we were unable to start our vehicle.  After sweating profusely and trying to start our car, Eddie came out a couple times to ask if we needed help, and when I finally agreed to his help, he was able to start our vehicle right away (saved us big time).  

Upon leaving he refused our tip for helping us and simply stated "Come back and see us again soon!"  So that's why I give this place a 5 out of 5, you just can't beat good food and great service!
