E9lp-WOCflgY9wrGf0aMGg This little taco truck has become my latest addiction!

Cukis parks just south of the intersection of Decatur and Blue Diamond from about 11AM to 2PM on weekdays. 

BRING CASH BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THEY TAKE! But I promise you won't regret it! 

Carne Asada Tacos; that's all I have to say. Carne Asada, Onion, Cilantro, Cheese, Corn Tortilla, side of Lime. These tacos are fucking heavenly...And they're so inexpensive! 

Cuki's also has way more than just tacos, but what are you waiting for? Stop reading this review and go indulge yourself!
