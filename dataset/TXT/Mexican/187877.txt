O3y-5O1n5l0ge_6KGyR_4A I used to come all the time but recently moved further away. I decided to give Super B Burrito a try on Eastern and probably wont go back. My next mexican fast food outing, I went back to Faustos because they were always friendly and the food was good ( for take out ) 

Asked the cashier what comes on their carne asada burrito just to make sure it would be what I wanted. Their burrito comes with carne asade, pico and guacamole. I asked them to add rice and beans, cool, got charged an extra buck like normal. Enjoying the futbol on the television when they call, Carne Asada w/ rice, beans, pico and guac. Smiled and thanked him. 

Got home, unwrapped the burrito and dove it thinking it would be delicious! Not what I had expected. They forgot the guacamole and pico, that sucks. Still tasted ok but couldn't take it back and I was hungry. Ate it.
