ITOa1olD2HTgEVOnH8zVog I had high hopes for this restaurant considering the reviews.  I went at 6 on a Friday, ordered the carne burrito enchilada style.  It took 35m for our to go order.  And then when we got it they made a mistake, and gave us the wrong burrito.  This was made worse by fact when I got back home I noticed that my burrito was burnt on the bottom.  It ruined the whole meal, I know they could smell it because I could when I opened the To Go container.  This is totally unacceptable.  Maybe they had a bad night, or a cook who was new, but this isn't worthy of the ratings given it.  I'd be embarrassed serving the food that they gave me.
