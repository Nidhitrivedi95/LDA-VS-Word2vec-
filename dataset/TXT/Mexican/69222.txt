The salsa is not your normal chunky style, but it was perfectly smoky and spicy. We also loved the bean dip and avocado pico.  I was definitely happy with the three taco plate - a great way to sample the shrimp, carnitas, and carne asada. I also find that rice and beans can be a deal breaker when it comes to Mexican restaurants and these did not disappoint.  To top it off, the Dandy Donkey cocktail is a must try!  Check it out during happy hour which they have daily from 2-6!!  Lots of great values and you won't feel guilty for sampling several items!
