zWKpPyzm0W9N5OEPDuwgMA Food here is crazy good, decent prices and they are quick when you order for pick up. My fiancé usually gets the steak burrito which is packed with flavor. I comes in two sizes. Regular and large. I'd get the large because the regular is a little smaller than you would think. I get the chicken vampiro which is an open faced taco on a tortilla. I am absolutely in love with horchatas however their's is too sugary for me. Staff is nice and friendly and the place is clean and neat :)
