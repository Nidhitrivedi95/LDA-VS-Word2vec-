Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ We had a terrible experience at this restaurant and will never go there again.  It started with getting seated for our 8:30 pm reservation.  We got there 15 minutes early and were told over and over that it was just a few minutes more.  In the meantime others were seated ahead of us.  (We were a party if 2!). We were finally seated at 9 pm after ridiculous behavior by the hostess staff.  We asked to speak with a manager who listened patiently and bought us a drink but he did not seem terribly sympathetic.  Food was very ordinary, my carnitas very dry.  The next morning both of us have sick tummies.  Stay away!!
