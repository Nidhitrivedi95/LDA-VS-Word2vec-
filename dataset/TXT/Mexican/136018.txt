iOt7ebp4Zy-5YUjHL1rbmQ Got thereon a Saturday night around 6pm with a group of 6 adults and 2 children. Inside had one open table and the patio was about 1/3 full. About 8 people in front of us in line. Ordered the family packet (1 pound of meat - carne asada and al pastor - plus 16 tortillas), 2 cheese quesadillas and 2 stuffed quesadillas (chicken and birria) - came out to around 45 bucks. Food was out and hot in about 7 minutes. Even heard them call out orders that were placed after us while waiting for our food. Very impressed with the speed by which they were able to whip up our large order.

Carne asada street taco was my favorite with the stuffed chicken quesadilla coming in second. With that said, everything was tasty. If I had to be picky, maybe the al pastor was a bit dry? However, I've had al pastor very few times, so I'm no expert. Loved loading up the taco with stuff from the salsa bar, including the pickled onions. Next time, I'll forgo the raw onions that come with the street tacos and just stick with the cabbage, salsa, jalapeno and pickled onions. My daughter and son loved the cheese quesadillas.

I look forward to street tacos on my annual trip to Mexico and I'm confident that BYT can satisfy my cravings between trips. 

Line was out the door by 6:20pm.
