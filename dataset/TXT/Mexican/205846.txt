pyeoyouJWxxcwzfugfessQ Went here on 12/15/16  supposedly their grand opening but no signage to indicate that. We were seated promptly.  Wasn't busy, maybe 10-15 other people there in the restaurant and at the bar.  Order was taken promptly, but the waitress couldn't answer all of our questions about the food.  We each ordered 2 tacos, I had a side of papa's fritas (waitress didn't know that was french fries) and my friend had a side of black beans.  The black beans arrived first, then after about 5 min. the tacos came and then we had to make 3 requests about our papas fritas, we had finished everything else and we had to still wait for the fries.  There seemed to be an excess of employees there, but mostly congregating at the bar and talking among each other.  The food was good and prices reasonable.  I may give it one more chance just for that reason.  The staff definitely needs some customer service skills.
