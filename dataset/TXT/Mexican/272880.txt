WVzCMOvn9MnEwTC20GmIWg I was really hesitant to come here with the 3 star rating and not so great reviews but I'm glad I gave it a chance. My boyfriend and I first came here on a Saturday night. It was busy but we didn't have to wait long for a table. We came back again yesterday and it was quiet, which we liked.

Atmosphere:
- It was nicer than I expected. I like how they have the bar with a TV
- The layout is OK overall but it's a turn off if you're seated in certain areas ; e.g. facing towards the washroom area which lacks a main door and is beside the kitchen OR facing into the back where you can see the poor guy washing tons of dishes
- The front section where you can walk in and buy salsa, guacamole etc. and pick up your order is great. Saves people the trouble of going to the bar, like other restaurants

Food:
- Choriqueso was delicious. My boyfriend loved how cheesy it was. I probably wouldn't get it again unless there was more people to share with. Gotta save room for the tacos!
- Nachos was the best I've ever had anywhere. I usually pick at nachos at bars if other people order it but I was never that into it. We ordered it with sirloin steak. The amount of toppings was perfectly proportionate. They didn't come with salsa or sour cream but our server was nice enough to bring us some.
- Tacos were amazing. So far on my taco hunt, Mad Mexican is the winner. I liked them so much I came back within 2 days! I had the carnitas de michoan, ensenada style with white fish and sirloin steak. The carnitas was definitely my favourite!

Service:
- Both times the servers were nice, but our food took forever to come out! The appetizer always came out within good time, but the main meal took too long.
- I think some better training is needed as well. I wanted to try the ceviche and I asked our server about the portion size (individual or shareable). She told me it was like a soup. I had never had ceviche before but based on pictures I always thought it was like a cold salad. So I looked up pictures and sure enough, NOT soup. So that's a fail on their part.
- Our server also asked us if we wanted the sauces for our tacos. Um obviously! That should be brought out without asking!
- When we came yesterday, they introduced their new menu which hiked up their prices so no more 3 for $12 tacos, unless its lunch.
- We ordered 2 carnitas, 2 ensenada and 1 sirloin steak. Our server ended up charging us individually per taco, instead of combining some of them. Not a huge deal but it displays laziness.

Overall, my review seems negative but I really do enjoy the food here. I just think they need to step it up with their service if they want repeat business.
