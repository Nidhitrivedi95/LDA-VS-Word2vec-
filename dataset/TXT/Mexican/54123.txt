We got there late and the food was still fresh. I got the fajita taco salad with chicken and my husband got the chicken flautas. The chicken was very moist and seasoned very well. I suggest if you have a choice of meat, get the chicken... I digress.

They also served fresh guac with both of our meals that was super yum and it did not cost extra!

Overall, the food was great as was the service. Even though we live in brecksville we might drive the hour again for this place : )
