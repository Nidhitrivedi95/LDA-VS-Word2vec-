jDQIKfsfJU3M8M6n0ESKFg I normally don't rate this way because taste comes before anything else for me, but I couldn't even try the food here due to incompetent front register employees. I have young kids so take out is our preferred method of trying new places. I called to place an order and was asked to go on hold, I said sure politely, and then got hung up on. I figured it was an accident so I called again and no one answered the phone. Okay, I get that I am calling during a busy time. Called a 3rd time waiting for a long time, was put immediately on hold again and then hung up on. Maybe the food is good, but if they can't even take an order that is pretty pathetic service
