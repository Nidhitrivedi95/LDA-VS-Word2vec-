yz66FIUPDKGhILDWzRLeKg We took our 6 year old son to celebrate his birthday this past Saturday evening. He loves cars and trucks and we couldn't have chosen a more cool place to celebrate than Slicks. He loved the basket of cars the waiter dropped off at the table for him and his sister to play with while we waited for our food. The service was stellar.  They all went above and beyond to make the dining experience memorable and the food was delish. I had the tortilla burger and was very pleased. The green chili fries were amazing. They celebrated my sons birthday with a warm cookie and ice cream and a trip to the hot wheels machine on our way out. We will definitely be back!  Thank you Slicks for making my sons day!!
