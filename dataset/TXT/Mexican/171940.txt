MAuSh7NKoT__CQ4BumoayA Obviously the name means that you should order lots of tequila long before you order the tacos! Good chips and salsa. Bad drinks. Horrible food. Had enchilada trio. Yuck. Wife had house specialty tacos. I tried one. Wouldn't feed to my dog. Go to Cabo Wabo for a good meal and drinks if you are in the mood for awesome Mexican. Their fish tacos are out of this world. Red Rocker Martini is a hit as well. I should have walked.
