F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw WHAT AN AMAZING FIND!  We were in town for a wedding and wanted something more farm to table. We got lucky and found this fantastic modern Mexican place. When we called, they said an hour wait but the bar is first come, first serve. We decided to go up based on reviews and head for the bar. 

Bar seating is downstairs and restaurant seating is upstairs. The ambiance is perfect for a date night out.  We got lucky and got a table in the bar area. There's actually lots of seating where guests do not have to sit at the bar but still get restaurant style service. We were happy on the first floor.

We had a fantastic male server. He gave us some great recommendations. We ultimately decided on the salsa sampler and a margarita sampler to start with. We did spicy mango, cucumber, and pomegranate. SO DELISH!  And not what you would expect. For our actual meals, we got the atun and the duck, and shared them both. We were completely stuffed but saw a fried ice cream go by and couldn't resist. SO WORTH IT!  

Everything from start to finish was perfect. Whenever we are back in the area we will be back!!!!
