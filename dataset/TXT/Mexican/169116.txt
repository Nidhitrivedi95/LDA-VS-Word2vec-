lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw Our server was amazing, the food was great, we had a coupon. This would definitely be a five star review except for one thing- the guy clearing our plates seemed to hate us. He was constantly hovering and trying to hurry us along, going as far as taking our dessert forks away and trying to clear or table before dessert even came. We were initially having a blast and were literally enjoying three courses so it's not like we were being stingy and just nursing single cocktails for two hours. Feeling so rushed really made us uncomfortable and kind of dampened the mood. By dessert, we just felt really awkward. Our server was outstanding and accommodating with our slightly quirky order and the food was really really good. The odd service from the one employee was literally the only weird spot in an otherwise amazing experience!
