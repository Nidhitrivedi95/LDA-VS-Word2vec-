8iVd6gMWKGGU9SL55B4vjg While visiting my parents in Pittsburgh, I've been to Los Chiludos three times over the past year.
I've tried at least a third of the menu and, for the most part, everything is pretty darn good.  The chips are always freshly fried, perfectly salted, and are thick enough that they don't break when you dip them into guac (a big plus for me).  The guac itself isn't as good as chipotle's (yeah I said it!), but its still pretty great.  The carnitas sopes are awesome, especially the corn cakes, which are on par with the meat and queso fresco on top.  The beef quesadilla is also good, albeit on the greasy side.
Those were all the things I had the first two times I went, but the third time was kind of a let down.  It was lunch time on Christmas Eve, so the regular cook might have been out, but the chorizo chimichanga I had wasn't that good (3 stars).  It just wasn't that flavorful, but it was a great value for the price because its huge.
I still think that this is about as good as Mexican food gets in Pittsburgh and a solid place to go to if you're in the area.
