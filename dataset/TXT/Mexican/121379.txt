h4Q-uSoOIhMoIsOhat6l3A I wish I could give this no stars! Went on a Friday night around 8:40pm and service was so slow. We order preparada's and it tasted like straight tomato juice and beer. They didn't have the family platter that we wanted so they recommended the fajita platter. The shrimp was  dry and cold.  We also order a chile relleno. It was so cold that the cheese wasn't even melted. The other location is so great, we had high expectations. Won't be returning.
