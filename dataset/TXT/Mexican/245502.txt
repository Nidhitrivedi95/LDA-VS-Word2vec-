Tr8TJnMoSgBvfZvmCx9-eQ My wife and I ate at this restaurant on a Saturday night on the recommendation of a friend. The staff is clearly overworked, service was glacial, and we were ignored for most of the evening. One of the margaritas was basically watered-down unflavored tequila. The chips were good and the queso was satisfactory, but the entrees were served barely warm and not particularly appetizing--one dish was unseasoned and dry, another was served in a sauce reminiscent of paste. Will not pass the recommendation on.
