rjlAUHT8B6KhKAmkZqS1xw I give this review in hopes that the business reads the concerns and critiques of its patrons. Being it's in our neighborhood and inviting ANY upscale business in the area, I was beyond elated to watch the birth of this restaurant. We waited months and months for the place to open, ending up making it in on our anniversary with my wife. The place is GORGEOUS.  Worth going just for the ambiance. The service was pretty good. Our server was really friendly and kind. The drinks were top notch and we'll be back for those alone. The food, meh. 16$ for some pork with super dry, but soggy, and stale (I know it sounds weird. Couldn't figure it out myself) but over all inedible tortillas. Not very plant based friendly (which is fine, can't win them all) but left my wife with very minimal options. The chips served with the guacamole were obviously not made in house and were relatively stale.  10$ for that (though the salsa that accompanied it was amazing).  Over all, a good date night place for drinks and maybe an appetizer. But we spent a lot of money for pretty subpar food.  I want this business to thrive, it's a selfish endeavor for I want our neighborhood to grow. I hope the business can as well.
