b207RNqIAhTd4JsRsnXB1Q This is a place that I didn't really want to yelp because I don't want it to get any busier.  But they deserve their kudos too. The margaritas are superb!  I love the square glasses. And honestly it doesn't matter what you order- it is all so good here.  The salsa actually has flavor and isn't a runny mess. My favorite dish is the flautas but everything is worthy of a try.  One of my favorite restaurants as you just can't go wrong here.
