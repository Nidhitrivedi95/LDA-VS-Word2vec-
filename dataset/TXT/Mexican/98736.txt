ERM603jbIbNqX2c7Ww1Qiw So disappointed in this place. They nickel-and-dime you for everything, but you don't know you're incurring by extra fees until you get to the cash register. 

While I'm not a big fan of their biggest competitor, due to taste, at least that place will tell you if there's an extra charge for something like guacamole. 

Here they go along the line and they simply asked if you want anything in your burrito, then you find out at the register that there was a surcharge for the chicken I picked, sour cream was extra, even an extra side of sauce was an extra fee!   They bank on the fact that you don't realize that's all extra, and then you pay once the meal is already prepared.  Don't get me wrong, many places charge extra fees for things, but the fact none of this is disclosed when you're actually getting the item, that's where  it becomes deceptive. The food was ok, nothing special, and they are very skimpy on the beans and rice, which again, their biggest competitor doesn't nickel-and-dime you to get a full portion. Buyer beware.

PS, seating is terrible, very few tables for the size. Once you get your food, good luck finding a place to sit
