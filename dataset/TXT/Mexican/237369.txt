SWDxTrwU_qlEcJp36IYquw What a disappointment.  I'm sure this restaurant has good food, it's why we came here. After 20 minutes though we left without even getting near the front of the line. This was avoidable, there was one person both serving and taking orders while another employee just sat there texting on his phone. Don't even think about going anytime after 12 unless you have 2 hours for lunch.
