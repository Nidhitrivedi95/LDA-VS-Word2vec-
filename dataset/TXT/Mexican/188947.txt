OA5Li3ySzhrbG_WvD_QGYA Bless you, Hipster Taco Joint. 

As with so many other ethnically-inspired eateries in town (I'm looking at you, Noodlecat, Choolah. Nothing but love!), Barrio brings modern foodie sensibilities to a traditional cuisine in the best possible way. 

I love choosing every last ingredient that goes into my tacos. I love even more that each one of those ingredients is fresh and flavorful. Every time I eat at Barrio, I leave feeling like I've had, all things considered, a reasonably healthful meal. For the price point, it's a winning combination and a fun night out.
