GrwvBAEALujIOPQeOfN1vA WATCH YOUR CREDIT CARD & PERSONAL INFORMATION! Being at a Mexican Restaurant decided to order a round of margaritas for the table, the waitress asked for our ID's and walked off with them. (okay so she went to scan them, so we thought) came back with a clipboard filled out with our DL#, DOB, other personal information and said all the restaurants in Scottsdale do this... well I've never had to sign a clipboard before ordering a drink, especially with personal information written out by the server.  Okay, so that was an annoyance, but we can move on and maybe give them a second chance. Well, checking my credit card statement a week later find out that the server over charged our credit card by $40 when we have the second copy stating the total the card was swiped for. Even have the servers name (Sydney S.) as printed on the receipt.

Food was only mediocre with entrées being brought to the table 30 seconds after the soup was brought.
