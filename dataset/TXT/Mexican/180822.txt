N95IG-T9bbR2iNL9_an1SQ I love tacos and this place just reaffirms that. I had 3 tacos that came with a side of chips. I ate the pork belly, kalbi, and carne asada tacos. They are just a little bigger than a street taco so 3 was plenty for a meal, especially with the side of chips. 

In the restaurant there's a little mini fridge with some salsas you can bring back to your table. A red salsa, green salsa, and habanero. Each salsa is labeled with the level of spice where red is 4/10, green is 6/10 and habanero is 9/10. They all taste amazing! The habanero is definitely 9/10. Though, I feel like the red and green are backwards. The green is a sweet salsa, and I'd give it 2/10 for a spice level. The red has a little kick, but it's not really spicy. That one I'd give a 4/10. 

I also dig the decor of the place. It felt modern and clean. Interesting take on the fake grass on the walls. I lot of taco joints always feel a little "cheap", for a lack of a better term, that make you say "yup, this is how I picture a taco join". Me gusta is more of "this is how a taco joint should be". I can't wait to bring some people in to try it out.
