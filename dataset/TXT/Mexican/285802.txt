y9T2hG0brf3GSpZidxrTiA I like Maria Bonita. The couple that owns it are great. The food is... a 3 at best. It's authentic recipes but pretty light on the spice. I don't just mean "hot" but spice in general. It feels that they have toned things down for a downtown Oakville pallet? But it is a bit disappointing. Though for Oakville, this is as good as it gets for Mexican :)
