2z7xERz1Nonyw8Kjr4SffA Got fish tacos. I noticed they batter and fry their own fish which you just won't see at most fast dinning restaurants. The tacos are served plain but there is a toppings bar with just about all you could want. For the fish tacos especially I loved the slaw and the not-from-a-can/jar tartar sauce with just a drizzle of the very hot sauce. I will definitely go here again!

5 stars based on it being exemplary in it's category of fast-casual food. Definitely up there with some other recent novel additions in this category in the Phoenix area (like fast casual pitas/hummus bowls).
