as_fyujgsdwtV56n31z-Sw Came here for happy hour, and I was a little disappointed. The service was great- the problem was the value. Drinks were all $5, which is okay, but there are better happy hour drink specials out there. The real let-down was the food. We ordered the chicken empanadas and the chorizo empanadas. It was $4 for each, and each had 2 empanadas. We expected to get maybe 4 per order for happy hour, but I thought if here amazing empanadas, $2 for each empanada might be great! However, these empanadas were definitely not amazing. The crusts weren't crispy, the flavors were all kind of muddy, and everything was drowned in a mayonnaise sauce. I've had amazing empanadas before, and these were anything but. Maybe the regular menu items are better, but for happy hour, I would recommend venturing elsewhere.
