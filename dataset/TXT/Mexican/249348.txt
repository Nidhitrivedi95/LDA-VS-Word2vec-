ufwkkMd9yr9cFU1R5ONArg I was looking for brunch spot in this area and I am so happy to find this joint. 
It is not spacious but it is cozy, lovely atmosphere... makes me miss Mexico. 

Anyway, I tried the green lemonade and it was really went well with this mexican style breakfast. Also, highly recommend to try house special Huevos rancheros! Its fresh, flavourful...mmmm. My husband had their delicious omelette and it was so tasty. Try this with chorizo.  

If you live in this neighbourhood, I highly recommended it.
