rbH0HuTcBvZBbiAnqufRqQ The homemade corn tortillas and the salsa are the high point here. The service was friendly and the small dining room was clean as were the bathrooms. This was the first horchata anywhere that I really didn't care for. Their was a lot of meat in the taco and the flavor wasn't bad. The enchiladas were cold and the cheese was far from melted. The beans and rice were a pass as in hard pass, no go. Take the chips and salsa instead. The sauces are not thickened with flour which makes a nice option for the gluten free folks. No offense to their abuela but my abuela would beat them hands down, as would several other abuelas I know. 
Update: 
I did receive a response from the restaurant owner which is always a welcome surprise. I'm hopeful that next time I'll get burned by some hot cheesy enchiladas! I also upped the star rating based on the attentiveness. Love to see that! Thanks!
