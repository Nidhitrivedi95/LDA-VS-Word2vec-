ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA Just tasted the new menu! Grilled Octopus is amazing and I don't typically enjoy octopus. Chase your winter blues away Roasted root vegetables, arugula, fine cheeses, thinly sliced citrus, with roasted nuts, hinted with vinaigrette. Ocotillo highlights winter tubers with a glimpse of spring. Brilliantly delicious cuisine!
