rXUZNVlpWMV5ORDDSguOEQ A week doesn't go by that I don't eat here... or dream of eating here. After many, MANY visits, I can say... every single time I have eaten here, the food has been delicious and the wait staff is friendly. The restaurant is beautifully, newly decorated. What a find! And thank you, Victor, for all the FUN!!
