pup46G8qFBG8695RtbQNwA I'll keep this review short and sweet. Five stars for the food, I highly recommend the hand squeezed margarita and the tamale!!  Minus 2 stars for slow to no service & awkward table side "check out".  This has the potential to be a really great restaurant, they just need their staff to pull it together.
