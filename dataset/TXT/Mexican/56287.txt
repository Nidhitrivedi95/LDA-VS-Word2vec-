a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg I've been coming to Casa Don Juan for over 15 years.  It looks like they have designated parking spots in the back so you can hopefully find parking. It can be difficult to find parking during peak lunch times.  My friends love this spot and if you are in the downtown area, I don't think you can go wrong here.

The food here is above average, meaning it's not the best I've had in Las Vegas, but definitely not the worst.  The prices here are on the more expensive side, but it won't completely break the bank.  It can get busy during the lunch hour for all the professionals working downtown. 

The service here is excellent and that's really their strength.  They will make your guacamole to order, the chips and salsa are really good.  The tortillas are made at the restaurant.

The machaca con huevos (eggs) are legit and authentic.  I've had burritos here, enchiladas, chorizo with eggs and they are spot on.  All in all, it's a solid 4 stars.
