dNy_RP9YolWZ3DmZTzRyOQ The only thing good was the prices. Confusion with the ordering process. Using your debit card was a hassle. No music very quiet and no ambiance.  Our food took 23 minutes place was only half-full. Employees were everywhere. Food served with cheap paper plates and Styrofoam. Asked for the manager said too busy, manager finally came and said your choice if you want to come back. Food was marginal and nothing special to say the least. Won't be back anytime soon.
