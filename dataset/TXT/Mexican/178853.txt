mz1zD5_eqyCQNuzAqB_iKg Pancho's Kitchen is outstanding. They serve traditional Mexican food and offer a full and tasty menu for vegans! I love how accommodating they are for their vegan customers.

Everything was so good, it was actually overwhelming, and I don't think we spoke the entire time we were inhaling it all.

It has also been years since I've had an elote! I used to flag down the elote man like every damn day growing up in Los Angeles, so I was in heaven! 

Lastly, I asked for a bolillo bread roll by itself, as the menu lists it as a sandwich-type dish, and I expected the waitress to think I was a weirdo. But not only did she NOT think I was a weirdo, she totally validated my request and we both went on about how delicious they are with just a little bit of [vegan] butter and sugar with cinnamon. She happily brought some to my table. I love her. And her mother (who was in the back cooking up deliciousness) also commented on how good that sounded and that she wanted some too! I love her also.

Thank you Pancho's Kitchen for providing delicious vegan Mexican options!
