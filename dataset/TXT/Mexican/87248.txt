dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA I just started going to Phat Phrank's when my office moved nearby... and I'm bummed I didn't know about it sooner! Their fish tacos are my absolute favorite (that secret sauce!!), but anything with adobado is amazing too. If you're feeling like Mexican but want to keep your summer bod in check, the trainer's salad is really tasty. And good for a solid amount of leftovers too. Only downside: the parking lot is a nightmare at lunch, but that's not Phrank's phault.
