d4qwVw4PcN-_2mK2o1Ro1g What happened Pink Taco?! Ever since you updated the menu, the carne asada tacos have not been the same. First the portions got smaller with an attempt at "gourmet plating, then regular size portions were brought back but the quality of the food was not as good as the first time. 
I use to love eating their carne asada tacos, but no more. On this last visit, the meat was so over cooked it tasted like very dry and old beef jerky! They no longer use real guacamole! Instead, they squirt avocado crema which is very nasty! It is a pale green color hue with a mayo aftertaste! Gross!! 
The margaritas were a little too sweat and I recall them tasting way better in the past. Not too sweet and you could  taste the fresh squeezed lime. 
My friend had the grilled fish tacos and she said her fish was not fresh and was dry! 
The chips n salsa are good, the service is fine and they have a great bar to gamble and watch sports. I miss the old Pink Taco menu. Please bring it back Harry Morton!!!
