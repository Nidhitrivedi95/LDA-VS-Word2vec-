7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA How on Earth does one decide what to order when everything sounds so stupid good? It was a painful painful experience narrowing down to one option...but since I was eating with my sister we got to do a little sharing! Score.

As has been stated- there will be a wait. I suggest you get in line.  The line moves quick, they know how to turn tables...make sure you stop at a cash station because they ain't messing around with any plastic.

We ordered up some coffee (for sure real good) and the A.M. poutine with the miso gravy and poached eggs. As well as the pulled pork benedict. I don't know how they do it but their poached eggs are glorious. The most perfect yolks.... blows my mind. 

Service was prompt and efficient and offered plenty of refills on coffee. When I return I will have to try a French toast or one of their specials but I don't know how I will be able to pass up a dish with those poached eggs.
