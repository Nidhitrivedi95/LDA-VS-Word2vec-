iZfeH70e_YFLrURT8WuCYQ Expensive, terrible bean burritos and cheese dip! Didn't expect italian when we ordered two bean burritos' that were served filled with a small amount of watery beans, and swimming in what smelled and looked like marinara or speggitti sauce! There was actual italian seasoning on our bean burritos.  We were really hungry, so we ordered the cheese dip to go along with basket of chips (which were stale btw)...The cheese dip was the texture and appearance of a high fructose corn syrup laced salad dressing, which tasted absolutely fake!  I really wished we would have drove through taco bell instead of wasting $36 on this italian/mexican food stuff. Ewwww!
