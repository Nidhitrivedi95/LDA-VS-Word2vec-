oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ We like the link and decided to give Chayo a try, expecting a mexican restaurant geared towards white middle america tourist pallets with strip prices. Considering my expectations, I was pleasantly surprised.  The hostess setup is a little weird. I asked the girl at the podium outside for a table inside and she told us to go see the hostess inside the doors. It just seems a bit redundant to have two spots. I guess she was the patio hostess. The interior is nice, seating was comfortable and service was quick, friendly and informed. Chips and salsa are not complimentary. The salsa was ok but I did not like the seasoning on the chips. It was similar to seasoned salt, not for me. The guacamole was overpriced and under flavored at, I think $9 but it had pomegranate seeds which was a nice touch and came with pork rinds, which was also good. The caesar salad had good dressing and a decent portion. Mahi Mahi tacos were on the dry side. The waiter asked how my tacos were and when I mentioned that they were a little dry, he comped them. Very nice The lobster tacos were good  and the short rib was very tender with enough fat left on to have a proper mouth feel but not so much to actually seem fatty and actually had more spice  heat than I expected and was served with a delish potato/oaxan cheese puree.  I was impressed and would return for the short rib.
