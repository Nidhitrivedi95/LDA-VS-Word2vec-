eoGAZLu8HQXxCNJC86uPcQ Very good and authentic Mexican food. Not Tex Mex-y at all. Huge portions, too.

We ordered the chicken enchiladas and chorizo tacos. Both came with rice and refried beans. The tacos were overflowing with delicious Mexican chorizo, and the enchiladas with salsa verde were perfect. 

The house hot sauce was super spicy but delicious. 

The server was very friendly and prompt. We'd definitely go back next time we're in the area.
