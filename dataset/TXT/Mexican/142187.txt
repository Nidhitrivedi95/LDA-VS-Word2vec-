jdaqp6fW0TqP2TdHatB7Pw I had the WORST dining experience of my life here.  
1) There are cobwebs and dust at the counter where you place your order.
2) The glass that my overpriced margarita came in was chipped at the lip.
3) The tables were all dirty and sticky. 
4) We waited a ridiculously long time for the food to come out.
5) When my burrito finally did come out, it had beef in it - I'd ordered fish.
6) Upon taking the burrito back up to the counter, I was told that I'd ordered wrong and that I would have to wait another 15 minutes for my food.  
I told the guy in the crumpled cowboy hat that I had not ordered wrong, he had made the wrong food and that instead of waiting, I'd prefer a refund.  
Anyone with any business sense or common decency would have said something like, "Sorry, we goofed, we'll make it better."  He, instead told me that he doesn't give refunds, that actually, my burrito was there, behind the counter, but lacking the avocado I'd asked for and he still did not take responsibility for his mistake.  
I will never go to this terrible restaurant again and I will tell everyone I meet never to go.  Everything was too expensive, we spent $56 and ended up walking out, after only drinking half of our drinks and eating one tiny $10 appetizer.   Do yourself a favor - don't waste your time here.  Other reviews say the food is good.  Maybe so, but there are other good Mexican restaurants and this place is not worthy of your patronage.
