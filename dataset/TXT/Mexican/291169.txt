YSYDJTCt5kzY2kKnLNGRiA I work in The Quarter and all 3 times I've been to Sol service has been horrible! Last night was the last night I will go. It took my friend 45 minutes to get her drink, the manager was busy helping the bartender, running plates of food that had been waiting more than 10 minutes to be served and it was not even that busy. The food is good, I will miss that but it does not make up for the lack of customer satisfaction.
