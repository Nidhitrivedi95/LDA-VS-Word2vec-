Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ This place is a very nicely decorated overpriced mexican food. I dont care how nice you present it and call it "watchamacallit" but, in the end im still paying $25 for a plate of beans rice and tacos. Nice decor, come for a drink but its really not worth shelling out $100+ for 2 people on dinner on mediocre tasting mexican food.
