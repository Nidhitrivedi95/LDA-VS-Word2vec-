HXCCITejNvcqtjNQRHnMPw I love this location as it is near my home and always has great service ! I'm vegan and I often have picky and complicated orders. They workers here are always courteous and provide excellent customer service. When I allow myself to splurge on the fries, I always want then we'll done and crispy. This is the only location that gets it right the first time around. 
The drive through I also fast and accurate here. 

I enjoy the 8 layer veggie burrito without the cheese and sour cream. They are currently 2 for 5$. My wife enjoys the fish and shrimp tacos that are now available.  Try the 1$ strawberry lemonade with real strawberries, it's delicious.
