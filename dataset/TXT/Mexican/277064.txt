Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ The place is a rip off. I ordered quesadilla and there was not enough meat in it for a mouse. The chips were half full and the sauce a quarter full. I noticed this another time. Trey have really cut their portions to the bone. There was literally not even a quarter spoon of meat. I would suggest going to the cafe their quesadillas there are to die for. The tortilla is crunchy with sour cream and lettuce and tomatoes. Imagine a piece of tortilla with tiny sliver of meat on a tray. Very insulting for a 5 star hotel.
