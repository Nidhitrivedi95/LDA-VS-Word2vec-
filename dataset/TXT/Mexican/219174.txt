rcSFEzRoIcDZhf8Frrm71A Being from Tucson (the home of the best authentic Mexican food) and spending a good portion of my life in Mexico...moving to the valley, it was difficult finding really good Mexican food.
Finally about 8 years ago I was told about Espos.  
My hair salon, down the street orders food from Espos at least once every couple weeks.
One of my co workers.  Frank Lonano from New York, had never had a chimichanga, or even heard of them before.  Knowing his tastes, I ordered him my favorite.  Machaca and bean chimi with red sauce.  I brought it to him, and he takes a bite and says  omg...it's a mexican eggroll.
It is now a staple at Salon 7000 to this day.
Out of at least a hundred visits has any of their food been anything but exceptional.
Salsa is fresh and tasty..tortillas always fresh.
On another note...without question the very very very best tacos and beans in the valley. 

Please try soon.  You will not be disappointed.
