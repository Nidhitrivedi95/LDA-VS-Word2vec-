2OkYkQRItlqbKw9Mz7flCA Phenomenal customer service by Connor. We went in there tonight to grab a bite about 5 minutes to close, and Connor was very polite, helpful, and friendly. He didn't seem bothered we were there so late, as many places typically do near close, and made sure we would be comfortable. He was extraordinary! Best service ever received from a type of restaurant such as this. 

He even came out to the patio and took our dirty plates to the trash for us when we were finished. He asked if we needed drinks or salsa before he closed them down. Superior service! He's going to go places in life.
