 The frozen margaritas were deliciously sour, especially with the salted rim. The paprika popcorn was incredibly moreish, and we got through 2 bowls in about 5 minutes.


 The nachos came with refried beans, which was unusual but tasty. Nothing world changing, but a good way to start off the meal.


 For main course, I had the gaucho grande - a mini taco with chilli, and a pork burrito. Both were good, although the frozen margarita is ruining my recall beyond that.


 We didn't manage any puddings, but the ones being brought to other tables looked tasty.
