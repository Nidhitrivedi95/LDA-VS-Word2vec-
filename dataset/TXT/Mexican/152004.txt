jWpTckAGWMWEffl2D7NhCA Had a shredded beef burrito and carne asada tacos.  Husband liked the burrito, I didn't. There were peppers and onion inside. Don't know if sour cream or guacamole was an option but it wasn't included. I liked the carne asada tacos, my
Husband did not. They have pico de gallo on it, tasted fresh for me. He didn't like pico. I was happy w the rice, seemed fresh. The salsa was good. The green one was hotter. I always base my Mexican food on the quality of salsa. 

So, 3 stars for me. Not terrible, not memorable. I'll try looking at other Mexican choices.
