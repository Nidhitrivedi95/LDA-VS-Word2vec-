JcMx_PIy0ROIlJWens4TAQ Very friendly service. Comfortable restaurant. The Mexican food is authentic and good. Enjoyed the beef burrito with cheese and topped with a tasty red enchilada sauce. The rice was a nice surprise with corn. The tortilla chips tasted home made accompanied by the best salsa I've ever tasted. Muchas gracias Fiesta. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain
