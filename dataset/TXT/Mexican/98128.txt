ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA Went to dinner with a friend who had been here for brunch. The cauliflower appetizer was delicious; it was sitting in kale pesto and nuts which I wanted to dump directly into my mouth. I tried one of the pasta dishes for my entrée. The serving size was good as I could not finish it, and it was served with two slices of grilled bread. They even brought another plate of complimentary bread as requested as my pasta had burrata which was good on the bread. The service was a little off, like our server was not very experienced or was fairly new to this restaurant. The overall concept is cool with the main restaurant, bar, and beer garden. I wish they had more happy hour offerings, but I plan on returning one weekend and giving brunch a try. The food is fresh, and you can tell some thought went into the menu.
