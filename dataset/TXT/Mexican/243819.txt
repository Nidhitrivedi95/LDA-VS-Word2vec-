thLX_k20SPJ0KyusGTBIHw I went to Diego Pops with my friends for the first time  and my server Anthony was very cheerful and very informative. He told us all about taco Monday and recommended the Guava coconut since we all wanted the prickly pear margaritas.
He also gave us a great recommendation about the steak tacos and adding pineapple and jalapeños.
It was absolutely amazing. I would highly recommend asking for him to help you out.
