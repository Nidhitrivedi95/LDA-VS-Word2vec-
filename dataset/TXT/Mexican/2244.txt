-FNquqGseSCVMWo7KbK-Tg Do not go here.  Their meet has a horrible taste, their chips are stale, and their sauces taste like it was made with dirty water.  I've been to other chipotles and I've enjoyed the food, but coming to this location has made me never want to eat at this restaurant again no matter what location it's at.
