dF47LvoipaCACkZ4LAnBMQ Oh my where to start...I am in Toronto for business and made a completely random decision to stop in for lunch. Instantly I began to regret my decision but since I only have an hour this would have to do. I had to walk up to the cash register to get someone's attention so I could be seated. Menu was a bit limited (however being from the US, I am unfamiliar with what would be normal for this type of cuisine) I placed my order at 1230 and at 110 I asked for the check having still not received my order. During my time sitting and waiting I witnessed the following: the server used his bare hands to take ice and put it in glasses to serve drinks; sodas do not receive ice as it is poured from a can and into a glass; if someone ordered a bottle if beer the server would open the bottle and would smell the beverage (I was blown away as I watched him do this multiple times). Perhaps not receiving my order was the best thing that could have happened for me.
