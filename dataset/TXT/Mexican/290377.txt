Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Brunch at Tableau was definitely a great time! Located inside the Wynn which was beautiful to walk through, the restaurant was decorated very elegantly. We were seated right away because of our original reservation.

I think that our server was either new or having a bad day, because he did mix up our order quite a bit - however, as being a former server, I feel that I do cut more slack than others.

I ordered the eggs benedict and coffee - more than enough food for myself and then some. My friends ordered omelets and a breakfast platter (split between 2 and still enough food) 

The ambience is the main attraction - food was good - service was okay.
