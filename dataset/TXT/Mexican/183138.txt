nM9NwHXy3EadihjJTG2i5w This place is very authentic! The atmosphere reminded me of being back in Mexico. I absolutely loved the food! I ordered the Wet burrito with cactus and my boyfriend ordered the asada tacos (which he loved for being a meat-eater). The service was fast and the food was yummy and filling. We will definitely be back!
