oE6gKgUfMd74m77d6hG9qg I work near by and always pass by this restaurant. Today, my co-workers and I decided to try it. We are so happy we did! The tamales are very big and have that great homemade taste! We had ordered both red sauce and green sauce chicken tamales. Both taste great, but beware...that green sauce is VERY spicy!
