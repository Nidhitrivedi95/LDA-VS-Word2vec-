cWtUKKsnEYy1WeR1aEdyMA My friend and I arrived early for our party of 10 and we enjoyed our time grabbing drinks at the bar while we waited. I ordered a kombucha sangria which tasted like a healthy glass of juice. My friend had a citrus margarita with this exotic finger lime. The bartender was patient and friendly when he explained the drinks and that made us all the more excited about our choices. 

When our party arrived, we were seated in the patio which looks like a funky backyard. Sadly, this was the last of my good experience at Fonda Lola.

I had mixed feelings about the food. I enjoyed the panela poppers, which were little cubes of breaded cheese in tomato sauce. However, the guacamole was bland and the churro was nothing special. 

What really stood out was the service (or lack thereof). Our server made us feel very unwelcome by quickly removing our plates before asking if we were finished and ignoring our flags that we wanted more food. What was unacceptable was her rude behaviour when settling the bill. From what I read of other reviews, our experience was not unique. 

I would not recommend this restaurant because of the poor service.
