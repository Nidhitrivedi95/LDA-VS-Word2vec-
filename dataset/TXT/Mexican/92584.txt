e13SEvJud_vgeDR_doL4sQ Decided to stop in for a late lunch-early dinner so we could munch away later at some 11 PM + specials in the city. Service was quick to seat us and the server was super friendly. Nothing serious here just some chips and salsa, nachos, tacos, and mixed drinks which were all very good for the price vs quality. Food came out of the kitchen super quick might have set the record or at least got in the top 5 of all my places waiting on food lol. I couldn't find nothing I didn't like about this place I mean it's located in a nice spot, the food was good, service was good, it's more like a Tex-Mex mix of a sports bar all in one and didn't really seem to try to be any more then that. Best part tab was under $30 for all this during happy hour being located in the Shoppes. 4 out of 5 all day no issues at hand I would return for the same deal if I'm visiting.
