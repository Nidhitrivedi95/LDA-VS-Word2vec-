Very quick service - I ordered at the counter and only waited MAYBE 5 minutes for my tacos! These people are quick at lunch hour. I had 2 of the vegetarian tacos - so very good. I wished I had gotten 3! They aren't too large so if you are very hungry, I'd suggest getting 3 or get 2 and a side. They were very spicy - not for the weak.
