XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Bobby Flay rocks!! Walked in for lunch & they had some accident in the kitchen so it was closed so came back again for dinner the next nite. Ordered the pork loin tenderloin -- it was amazing! must try! It had some nice heat to it which was just perfect for my palate. Sorry, I hate bland food. My wife is veg & ordered the Chile Releno which was excellent!! For dessert, went with the Deep Dish Banana Cream Pie which was just delicious!! Overall, it was worth the money! Yes, it pricey but hey you are in Vegas!! :)
