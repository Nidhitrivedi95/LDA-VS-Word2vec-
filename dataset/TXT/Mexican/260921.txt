VRwT0pscR5vESCrAnUpNwQ I live near by and am so happy to have this place around, as I find myself often craving their food! It's fast food, but fancier somehow. And more fun. They have a free salsa bar for you to access their many many many salsas and hot sauces. So fun. Plus even if you just order a burrito, chips are free! Portions are great. Ambiance is wonderful - very lively - friendly staff. Can get very busy, but you can always opt for takeaway. Plus Guacamole comes free! Finally someone understands!!!!!!

My only negatives...they seem to be upping the prices - since they opened, but it's still worth it. Also, tried the quesadilla. Less than impressed. I'm sticking with my yummy burrito!
