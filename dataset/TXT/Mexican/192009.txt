OioKDmq7U1WFMqaPWGUR3A This is my go to place for pupusas in vegas and my family from out of state always want to come here when they are in town. The flavor is good and consistent and they are always cooked just right. The drawback is the actual dining room tables and chairs, there not too comfortable and don't fit/go along with the tables so its awkward seating if you have four people at a table. The service here is a bit slow and also inconsistent at times but the food is definitely great.
