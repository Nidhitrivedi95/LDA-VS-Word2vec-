UqhVZYUeoBGroYpZB-9jlQ Damg, I should have read my previous review before I came here.  Note to self might be worth it to upgrade my cellphone so I can do apps and avoid these situations lol

Same as before took about 10 minutes to be acknowledge and another 10 before I got my tea.

Ordered the ribey (med well), skillet mashed potatoes and the brocolli (to honor GHW Bush, lol).  They steak came as ordered and hot.  I got some tepid fries but he corrected it (ended up passing on the cold stale fries) and the mashed was ok.  I did not know you could over cook brocolli it was way DRY and looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp all day.

Server never came back to check to check up on me after the mix up our the brocolli  would have been gone too.

So the service was about the same as last time.  So 2 bad visits in a row less than a year apart.  I say go eat at the Long Horn Steakhouse on the other side of the complex!
