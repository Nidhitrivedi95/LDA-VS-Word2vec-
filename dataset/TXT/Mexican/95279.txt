eem6eoAiYL9UcQUE0kMD-g Tried this after reading the reviews here on Yelp. I wish we had tried it sooner-it was one of the best places we've eaten at in a long time! Service was awesome and we were even offered samples to help us narrow down our choices (we couldn't decide between the green or red chile). Both were amazing. We also had the carnitas, carne asada & Barbacoa tacos as well as the bean and cheese burrito. It doesn't look like the most appealing place from the outside but I wouldn't let that deter you. It's clean and the food is amazing!
