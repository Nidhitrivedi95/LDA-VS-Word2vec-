zN4f3aLeCuIhCTPRH0di-A Stopped in for lunch after reading a review in the LVRJ and some good reviews on Yelp. It's a new restaurant that's been open for just a few months. The restaurant is very nice and the staff is fantastic. They have a great selection of cocktails including many varieties of Margaritas. The menu has a lot of variations and options as well. Ordered the stuffed Jalapeños which were fantastic. Ordered the Barbacoa enchilada and Chile Relleno. My wife ordered the coconut shrimp tacos. Everything was delectable. The food  is prepared with quality ingredients and everything was fantastic. We will be going back to Salud often.
