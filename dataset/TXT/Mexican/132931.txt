iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg Some of the best tacos I have ever had, period!
The selection leans towards the California style taco, but that's not a bad thing. Expect fabulous flavours, perfectly cooked ingredients, and getting maximum value for the dollar. My favourites are the pulpo (octopus) and the camarones (shrimp), but the mushroom and cactus or carnitas (pork) aren't far behind. Mmmmmm, tacos! And get the fresh fruit juice for just $2 - how can you go wrong? The menu includes plenty of gluten free options so everyone can enjoy the fare.
Okay, the place is small and a bit of a dive, but who cares? If you need to have your tacos served on china and your drink in Riedel crystal, this place is not for you. You have to be willing to eat with your hands and take what space you can find, so don't get too fancy here. Me, I would push my way through the crowd any day for more of those tacos!
