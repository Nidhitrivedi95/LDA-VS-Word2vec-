qHseX2NHeUUedIgs_VasZA This place serves the BEST TACOS I have ever had. MUST get the beef tongue taco. Staff is incredibly nice and polite and the restaurant is very authentic and simple. The know what they're doing and they do it great. I honestly cannot wait to go back. It's great for any meal or occasion, whether you want to grab something to go and walk around the south side and eat it or sit down for a meal. 

*PS, while the tacos blew my mind, the other food is easily on equal footing and is delicious
