MesBAxNk_M7ISbBmVDiiWQ We enjoyed everything!  The mofungitos appetizer (Fried Plantains shaped into a small bowl and filled with our choice of meat)  We chose chorizo and it was spectacular. A lot of unique items and will be be back for them! Salsa and traditional Guacamole were both very fresh. We filled up on snacks and just shared the enchilada verde, which was just enough to cap off the night.  Margarita was solid, but the tequila selection was limited for anything aged. Also served Horchata!
