Q28MO9hEMyG0xrAnOF-dSw My friends and I have been coming to Stand Up Scottsdale for years (both locations). It is our ONLY place for comedy! We've tried others in the Valley and no others can compare. I appreciate this place where I can get amazing comedy, along with great food and drinks (only 1 drink minimum)! If you've never been, Stand Up Scottsdale is a must!
