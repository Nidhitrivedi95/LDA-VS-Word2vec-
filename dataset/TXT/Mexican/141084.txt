Ja4stXdNYr39u5CZHMNtjw Not a huge fan. I'm one for good service and this place wasn't it. It took the server 20 minutes to come greet us and take our drink order. Server never gave her name or the specials for taco Tuesday. We had to go to the bar to get water and call her over to get our check. The food was amazing however. The house margaritas weren't anything special.. A little to sweet for my liking.
