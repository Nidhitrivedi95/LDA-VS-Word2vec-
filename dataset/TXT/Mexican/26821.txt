3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ This is my first time here. It was highly recommended and suggested by a friend. The atmosphere is quaint and personable. The service received was very attentive and thorough. The food was amazing and had zesty taste. I ordered the taco plate which comes with a free side or their sweet corn on the cob for an additional $2.50. You can get any of their tacos on a corn or flour tortilla or in a lettuce cup. I was very satisfied all around with the food, service and atmosphere. I will definitely be back again and highly recommend this establishment.
