Great place for happy hour if you're by yourself or just meeting a friend after work.  Everyone is pretty friendly so it's easy to meet people.

The later crowd is when the groups start filing in.  The "let's take shots because we're in our 20s and am not going to pay for it the next day" groups can get a little loud on the weekend, but not too bad on the weekdays.

The food is solid overall.  My personal favorites are the salsa, guac, Johnny salad, short rib Torta, and Bistec and Huitlacoche tacos.  Beware of the Chochinita taco...when they say hot, they mean five alarm fire hot!  Those of you who think, "oh please, I can handle hot food.  I can handle this taco."  Well be prepared to bring a box of tissues, because I guarantee you'll be in tears from the heat coming off of this taco.  Don't say I didn't warn you!

The margaritas are the big winner.  Made fresh and they use good tequila.  The spicy one is really good, but depending on the bartender, you may want to ask them to cut out the spicy parts of the jalapeno if you just want the flavor (and not the heat).

Overall, this is a really fun place.  It's a great place if you're looking to meet hot guys/girls, or if you just want to sit at one of the large bench tables with a group of friends and hang out.  Good luck parking, but definitely take advantage of the valet across the street after hours on the weekend.
