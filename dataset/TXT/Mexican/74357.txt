cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A This place is so bad I made a yelp account just to tell you all how poor it is. I loved this place when it was in Chandler, but this Phoenix location is a dump. Not a "dive" just a dump. The food was half cold, half scalding hot like it was in a broken microwave. The location is terrible with a poorly maintained dining area.  Everything that was good about the chandler location is terrible about the phoenix location, and they are equally distant from my house. It was a 30min out to chandler that I would be excited for, but the 30min drive to phoenix location was such a terrible experience I will never return. Terrible. Just terrible.
