LxnZTxUoj063tbJaLQ7DHQ This Taco Bell is an anomaly for Taco Bells and fast food restaurants in general. Food quality is always great and the customer service is stellar. Although sometimes their opening line in the drive thru of "hi there, hello there, how's it going out there" sometimes drives me crazy I'll take it over an employee who doesn't care.
