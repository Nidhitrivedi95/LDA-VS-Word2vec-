ZO3ihx5FOObI_uCgin4x8w Ugh. Not good. Here is a list of crap that happened at our visit. 1. Took forever to get our drinks. 2. 2 of the orders were backwards- had the wrong meats-no apologies no nothing. 3. They forgot to deliver our "unlimited" beans and rice-by the time we flagged our waitress down most were almost done with their entree. 4. Found a bug in my drink. Yum. Go here at your own risk. Overpriced and underwhelming.
