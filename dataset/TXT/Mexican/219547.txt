reMD4XrJSJ-bQ185AmZL3A I was generous with the 2 stars because the food was absolutely great. With Del Taco it usually is, of most fast food places.
Totally weird that in one of the two entrances here you end up passing the bathrooms before dining room and counter, very weird layout. Here's our bathrooms before you try our food?

Dining room was gross. Every table I went to sit at was dirty. No one has cleaned in a while. Staff had plenty of time to laugh and be slow behind the counter but not clean the dining room? When you are over staffed like they were this shouldn't be an issue. Dirty trays all over, used napkins, crumby booths. For the amount of locations there are of this place I will not return to this place. 

The service was mediocre at best. From the walk in to walk out I wasn't happy. Food again was really good. Great flavor. I asked for my fries well done/crispy and they weren't. Luckily their fries are always good no matter what.
