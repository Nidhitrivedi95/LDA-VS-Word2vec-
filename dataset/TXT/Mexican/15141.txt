1_y5e1u-o93EKOigXgR3LQ I had the Baja Fish taco last Friday nite as I was heading home after another establishment in PC and I was still hungry.  Cool little place, I'm sure they will do well. Needless to say the Baja Fish taco was very yummy and inexpensive, $3.60.  I'm looking forward to trying more items on the menu.  I hope they open up a store close to Bloor and Jarvis where I will be moving to:)
