J5ebC7fKqrSF8KuS8d6hgw I give this place a 5 star, because of the service... and the Fresh squeezed Margarita...OMG, the best.

Our waiter, all I remember that he was Black and puerto rican... funny, gives excellent service, friendly... 

We ordered soups, and the fresh bread sandwich...and all of it was delish... price was okay . but nothing like Fuego del Mar...(don't go there).  

I'm going back for sure... my family and I agree this was a great place to visit.
