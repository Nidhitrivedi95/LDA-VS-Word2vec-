ohqeJybL1FuFzN4P8pwxhg Went to this einstein's on a Saturday morning and they were so unorganized and falling apart. After being first in the order line for 15 minutes they still failed to acknowledge us or any of the other waiting customers. Behind the counter it was hectic like they had never experienced a morning rush at a fast food bagel restaurant before. You could see the workers dropping bagel slices on the floor and just going around in circles. There were workers there who were just standing around not doing anything but playing with their gloves. After waiting a total of 20 minutes first in line to order we finally left and went to the Starbucks down the street.
