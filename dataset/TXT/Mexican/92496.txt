e13SEvJud_vgeDR_doL4sQ Checked in with Yelp and got a free Mexican corn on the cob. Got my own huge basket of chips and some very tasty salsa. Had a large, well made margarita and the best chicken quesadilla's I've ever tasted. Excellent lunch! Came back the next day so my husband could try it too.
