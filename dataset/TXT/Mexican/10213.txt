_XN-GwzZwAyIqLKJsl2htg We came here for dinner on a Sunday night. The decor is very hip and modern with a club vibe. The food is as promised, fusion-y modern goodness. We had the roasted corn side, bacon wrapped dates, spicy crab noodles, and lobster mango sushi. All of it was tasty and provided a good variety of flavors to enjoy. I plan on coming back for their enticing brunch deal.
