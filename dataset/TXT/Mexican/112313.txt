G6BwYw_0_atLPTzI1uokIA I was so excited to have another Mexican restaurant open in my neighborhood. I gave this place a try not long after it was open and I was extremely underwhelmed. Nothing was horrible, just below par of what I can get other places that are also nearby and in competition with this one. The food was only ok and the margaritas were fair. I will order a house margarita on the rocks every time and I feel that is a great way to base there drinks if the house is good.  I always sit in the bar area because it is always livelier. It took me many months to give them a second shot, and when I did, I had the exact same results. I feel that there are way too many places to get better food and experience for my money.
