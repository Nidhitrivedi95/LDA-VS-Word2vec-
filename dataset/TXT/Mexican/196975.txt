oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ My husband and I ended up here out of convenience after an event at The Linq. It was a weeknight and they were busy, but not busy enough to have a wait for a table.

My first thought when we walked inside was that it was a little on the loud side for a weeknight. I would get it on a Saturday night, but usually weeknights are more mellow.

We started with Chips & Salsa which were good, but are additional instead of included like most Mexican restaurants. It happened that we had come in on taco Tuesday when tacos were 50% off so we ordered tacos. We both thought our tacos were pretty good and enjoyed our meals. I also ordered a side of Mexican Street Corn which I thought was very good. 

So, we liked our food, why a three star? I understand that places on the strip or in this area are going to be a little on the expensive side, but this one is too much. Even with half off taco night it was overpriced. I would only return when they are running a deal because I couldn't justify paying full price here.
