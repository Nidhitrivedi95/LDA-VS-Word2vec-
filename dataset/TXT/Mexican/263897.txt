WB8BmFMORvshjb7tBw0e0Q Only reason for the one star is because the service was decent. People talked this place up so much, what a let down!! Wasn't even real mexican food. Carnitas were sweet. Enchilada was cold rice tasted like cardboard and cold. Beans tasted as if they were out of a can. Salsa was bland. Tostada wasn't a real tostada beans should have been refried and layered on top. There was no Asada probably because they don't know how to make it. I will admit that the chips were the highlight of the meal.
