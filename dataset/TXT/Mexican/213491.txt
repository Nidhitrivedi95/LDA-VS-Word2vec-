QWbP1vKQOFjN-6pr0-78zQ We've been going to this location frequently since they opened because we loved it. The food used to be excellent and it was always clean and the people were friendly. The last few months it has gone downhill rapidly. It is now usually filthy, including cockroaches during out most recent visit. The food is now just adequate because the cook keeps changing so you never know what you're going to get. .
