JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg It was quite busy on a Monday night since they offer locals 25% off their entire menu, so it was good we had a reservation, since walk-ins were waiting to be served.

Service was OK, our waiter was friendly and personable, but somehow the bar order got mixed up and took way too long.  I'm not sure what went wrong, but it was too long a wait. The waiter did try to keep up, but I get the sense it was just too busy.  I don't blame him, just was surprised by the wait for drinks.

The tableside guacamole was quite good.  Though, I didn't really like the brand or style of chips they served with it.  The chips were too thin to drip well and didn't have much flavor.  But the guacamole was very good.

My wife had the Mahi-Mahi taco and it was tasty with the mango salsa.

I had a steak/shrimp fajita and it was OK, but a bit too greasy for my liking and the steak was a bit tough, but the shrimp was grilled very well and was really good. 

I liked that they had a Juan Gabriel concert playing on the TV.  Made it the place feel festive. 

Overall, it's a good place to go, especially for locals on Monday.  But reserve ahead to avoid the crowds.
