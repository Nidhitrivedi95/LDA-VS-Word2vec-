_HVZ1V8IDa49MWdejx9BbA Steve and his crew are awesome they're smiling and working together they look like they're having a great time I've come to this location several times and they're always smiling the food is delicious it's fresh they were even able to customize my food to fit my taste I appreciate that as I am somewhat picky they even brought my drink to the table , how considerate is that ? I've been to other locations and this one seems to be the best the food is always delicious on point just the way I like it I love tacos by the way. I would highly recommend this restaurant in the airport to any traveling people who are hungry for some good tacos. thanks again Steve you and your team made my day, even though you were busy you were able to quickly accommodate me like I was your only guest.
