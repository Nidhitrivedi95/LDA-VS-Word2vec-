quBpp-CIt-XWF_4rIsM_jQ A fabulous place to sit and relax.  We were originally looking to eating somewhere at West Gate but with the crowd we changed our mind and found Beach Club Cantina.   The food was AMAZING!  By far the best Chimis we have ever had and the salsa was delicious.   With the live music (we visited on a Saturday night) the wonderful staff (and very friendly and personable owner)  and the great fresh food,  you can't go wrong.   It is a must try.  Just look for it right next to the theater, you won't be disappointed!
