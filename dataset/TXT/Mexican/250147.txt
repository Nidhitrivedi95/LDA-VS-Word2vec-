UJb1PrUWDFfuzwUPc1pP4Q Stopped by for a margarita while in the Tempe area.  It happened to be Taco Tuesday so all tacos were $3 and house margaritas $6 so we had to try both. Got a fried avocado taco which was pretty good but could of used a little spice. The margarita was large but seemed watered down.  Good college area bar with good service and good Taco Tuesday prices. Also got our free "check in" Guac and chips which were tasty. Not bad but not outstanding either.
