zw9_mqWBn1QCfZg88w0Exg We had appetizers and drinks in the bar during happy hour. Our server was also the bartender,  her name is Sabrina. She is wonderful!  We had questions about the meat sauce for the enchiladas so she brought us a sample to try. Our water glasses never were more than half empy. She was quick to ask about refills and kept our chips and salsa full without us having to ask. It was my belated birthday so she also brought the crew around to sing and brought me a sundae. The service is great here and I highly recommend the restaurant,  bar and the bartender Sabrina.
