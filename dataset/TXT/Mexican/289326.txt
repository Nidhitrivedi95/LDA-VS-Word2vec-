YkOCo5ipV2he2WXIAlZb-A I really enjoyed the sushi/burrito fusion they offer here. This was my first trip, and the menu is well laid out. I think you could spend an eternity trying to build your own combination of ingredients, so the pre-designed models are a blessing.  I tried the Redondo (seaweed wrapped, sans cilantro, add ginger), and it was very flavorful.

The staff was attentive and helpful with recommendations. Portions were the right size (not too much, not too little). 

My only recommendation is a little more variety on the pre-designed rolls/burritos for quick ordering. I liked the layout of the menu that highlighted the protein in each design first, so keep it up!
