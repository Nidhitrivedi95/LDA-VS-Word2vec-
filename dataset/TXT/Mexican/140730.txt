Ja4stXdNYr39u5CZHMNtjw Inside they pump the music too loud - so, sit outside on the patio underneath the stars. Guacamole with pomegranate seeds was surprisingly tasty. Prickly pear margaritas are not to be missed. Staff was friendly but lagged it a little. Overall, not a bad choice for an affordable night out in Old Town Scottsdale.
