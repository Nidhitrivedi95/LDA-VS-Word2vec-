hEmY0N9HTMvleveS6_YqOg So boring it makes me weep to think that anyone would eat here and consider it good.  I wasn't super hungry so got a mushroom quesadilla.  It was grilled mushrooms in a pool of oil on cheese that tasted like it was Velveeta.  There was sour cream, rice, and refried beans which were lavender and tasteless.  My husband ordered a 3 enchilada plate, which literally had 3 rather unappetizing enchiladas on it, and a separate plate with some lettuce, pico de gallo and guacamole.  The chicken enchiladas were shredded breast meat, but with no spices, salsa, taste.  Apparently slow cooking the chicken with picante sauce and chicken broth or similar never occurred to the chef.  And there was no rice, no beans on an entree that seemed like it should have them - even if the beans are purple.  The chips were cardboard-like, the salsa more like ketchup with some additives.  I mean, seriously??  Nor was it particular cheap.  The entrees were generally in the $14.  That's what I used to pay in Napa, CA for and wonderful, tasty entree at one of our favorite Mexican restaurants.  This place has no right to be called a Mexican restaurant.  I used to go to the Mexican place that was in this location 3 or 4 years ago, and it was good.  Not the best Mexican food, but good.  And there was one in Sagamore Hills for a while.  But this place is an embarrassment.  I have no idea how this place stays in business - why anyone would want to eat her more than once - but it makes me sad to think that anyone might eat here and think that's what Mexican food is all about.
