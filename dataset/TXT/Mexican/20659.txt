Sure enough within the hour we we seated in a lovely if a little cramped table by the window. Restaurant has a lovely atmosphere and the staff were friendly and attentive upon arrival. I was most content at this point. I ordered the chicken fajitas without cheese, but was promised extra salsa. However upon delivery of the dish, there was no extra salsa and a full bowl of cheese, which made me feel slightly queasy due to my severe cheese allergy. My gf ordered the lamb, she was delighted with the cheese error, as she is a big cheese fan and she commented that this error would make her dining experience even better. She was very happy with the lamb, it melted in her mouth and she couldn't get enough of it. Overall the food was good and we would definitely come back. A major plus is the location of the restaurant, as is slap bang in the middle of the main shopping area and there are plenty of pubs nearby for a drop of local whisky or a pint of Guinness.
