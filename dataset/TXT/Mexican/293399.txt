yydyoWCY3LJYlPwVLKbJ3Q The nachos with chorizo was AMAZING!!! Loved it and we had three people and weren't able to finish it. My boyfriend got the Guinness and said it was flat. We then got burritos which were decent. I wasn't impressed by it but the beans and rice were awesome! Overall pretty good !
