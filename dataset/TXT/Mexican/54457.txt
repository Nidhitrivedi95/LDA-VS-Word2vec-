9t8PEynZGVCG1EjOQr1xBA I am not sure what Chicago Style means but I like it!!!!  I have only been here twice but I can say I really like what I have had so far.   

I went with their suggestion of Windy Style Fries.  You can do small or large and your choice of meat and nacho cheese or Monterey jack and guacamole and sour cream at no additional cost, wow!  I went with the small and it was still huge. The meat I chose was carne asada, and for cheese -Monterey Jack. This was my first asada fries so I can't compare but they were very good and even the small was definitely great for sharing.

I also had to try one of their tacos. Taco Cecina (beef) which is meat that has been salted and dried by means of air, sun or smoke. It was served on a yellow corn tortilla which I am usually not a fan of since they tend to be hard, but this place really changed that for me. it was delicious! The tortilla was smothered with a little bit of refried beans, the nice size piece of steak, cilantro, and onion accompanied by some lime Mmmm!  

I got to try my hubby's taco of tripa and chile relleno and they were also delicious!! 

A plus is that they also serve breakfast and they have a pretty big and affordable menu. They have so many meat choices and styles so I can't wait to come back and try them all!
