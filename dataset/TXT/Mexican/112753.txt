g9vzFlunYXagaH5hNkU2Uw Three words. Top shelf margarita! You HAVE to try one. We didn't know about this hidden jewel and started with sangria and mango margaritas. Both were good but the sangria didn't have a whole lot of flavor despite the abundance of fruit. Our awesome waitress, Asuzzana (I probably butchered the spelling), introduced us to what is now our favorite drink here! And drink prices are wonderful!!!

I wasn't too hungry so I chose the nachos (regular ones) and added cilantro. They were very good and the portion size was amazing. The beef was chopped really fine and flavored well. Not sure what the cheese sauce on it was but it, too, had a great flavor. I did also add beans to mine. Gotta have beans, right. 

Our son thoroughly enjoyed his kids' burrito. With two sides, he was left stuffed from just a kids' meal. 

The atmosphere is fun and lively here. We were extremely surprised that our party of six was seated immediately at 7pm on a Friday night! 

We will definitely go back.
