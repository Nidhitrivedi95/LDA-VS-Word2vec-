YZjqRPrLZBOh2Lz5iVbuHA This is the best Taco Bell I have ever been to. The employees are extremely pleasant, kind and customer driven. They often strike up a conversation with you.

While no fast food  resturant is perfect, this is among the best. I go at least once a week from Blakeney (a healthy drive but it's the closest location).
