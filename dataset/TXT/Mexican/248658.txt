The guacamole flight (we had cucumber/mint, habanero jelly, and corn) were are delicious!  (My favorite was the habanero jelly!)  I also had some shrimp Ceviche which was amazing.  The entrée portions are average in size, but definitely filling!  A return trip is definitely in the future!  Make sure to make a reservation as the wait times can be quite long!  The $$ should actually be more $$$ though...
