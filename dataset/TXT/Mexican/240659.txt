T9QjpTZPcWEa3i96tdLHbw We just recently moved to the area and wanted a quick bite to eat. We live around the block, so we figured this would be a convenient take-out place. Ordered the chicken tacos and the meat wasn't even seasoned...huge disappointment. Also ordered the Choripollo and it came out looking like the complete opposite the menu description.  Neither dish seemed to have any seasoning/spices and the salsa was essentially ketchup, absolutely no flavor or spice at all. 

Overly priced for very cheap and flavorless Mexican cuisine. Would not recommend if you have ever eaten truly authentic Mexican cuisine.
