of4V8nfW7GwJ03tLDdrOlA Sat at the bar while waiting during my layover between flights.  It was cool to see the bartenders have some rapport with some of the passing customers.  It gave it a "divey/neighbourhood" feel.  

I had the fish tacos which were OK.  The fries that came with it kinda sucked.  They were pretty stale.  The ketchup was pretty good, it had spicy kick to it.  At $15 for three tacos however it's a bit over priced even for airport food.

Sitting at the bar you're able to witness some stuff.  I should've followed my instincts and just pushed my tacos away.  Hygiene wasn't great with the staff.  One bartender got choked up and started coughing...immediately proceeded to make drinks with out washing his hands.  Another came by to pick up some cut limes clearing her throat over them, they were unwrapped. This is after I received my meal and got given silverware that looked a little dingy.  To make matters worst...a 1/4 way through my flight my stomach did not feel so good.  Luckily my flight was short and my place is near the airport, otherwise I would had blown up the bathroom (no pun intended)

Overall...stay away from here if you plan on grabbing a quick bite between flights.  It's overpriced and mediocre at best...and food poisoning on a flight is no fun. The star is more for the atmosphere of the bar area.  Bartenders should clean up a bit more though
