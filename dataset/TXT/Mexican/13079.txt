0Ge4hEQ8HYnrkfm8UHj2BQ This is the best Gyro (proper pronunciation is yee-row) in da Burgh. Owner operated - say hi to Brett - always behind the counter. Tell him Steve sent you. If you visit here 2x, he will recall your name!

At one point Brett had the opportunity to RE-brand and become part of what became The Simple Greek franchise of The Profit fame but turned it down to continue to do his own thing, thank you very much!

Go have a couple of Gyros  and an order of French fries  which is enough to share. Fountain drinks are free refills. Enjoy!
