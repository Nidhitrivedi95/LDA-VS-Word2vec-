rkzU4UiTTXF54-FOELy9eA My family and I tried this place for the first time for a late dinner. I ordered a fajita burro (large burrito) and was rather disappointed. The chicken and steak in the burrito was not very flavorful and it didn't come with rice or salsa. If you want an excellent, tasty burrito I'd recommend Nuevo Alcapoco in North Olmsted.  My brother was happy with his dish, el tapatio. We had great service and the decor was great. I don't think I would be back for another meal though.
