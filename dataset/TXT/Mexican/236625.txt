svPjZWp4Pa32fwI2gNlxJg We went for lunch and it was great. The food was so good and the amount you got for the price was good. The server helped me decide what to get but I have a feeling anything on the menu would have tasted good. We will definitely be going back over and over. We have been wanting a small authentic Mexican restaurant close by and Cucos will be our new go to for a nice lunch or dinner.
