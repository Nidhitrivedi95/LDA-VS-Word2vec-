Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ Don't bother!  I purchased a groupon for here and not only did they try to refuse it.when we came back 2 hours later for drinks they gave us even more nasty attitude.  Not the servers mind you the manager.  I reported this to Groupon and got a full refund for the terrible experience.

And to top it off the food is not worth the prices, it's good for about half as much money.

I say again DO NOT GO HERE!!! There are MUCH BETTER PLACES!
