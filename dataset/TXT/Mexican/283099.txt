XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg I'm pretty sure the reason why you are here is to answer the following question:

I know this is the restaurant of a celebrity chef, but is it actually amazing and worth the price, or is this a tourist trap and a waste of my time?

My experience at Mesa Grill last night can confirm, it really is actually amazing!

I had a quick dinner, so my review is based on one item. However, that item blew me away enough to run to Yelp and share my experience. I had the smoked chicken quesadilla, which was actually out of this world. 

The size itself was pretty small, but unlike your average small quesadilla, was still packed with gooey cheese and chicken where you can actually taste the smokiness in each bite. The guacamole, creme fraisse and roasted garlic shavings ensured that every bite was absolutely loaded with flavor. I even believe the tortilla itself was sprinkled with some smoky, chipotle magic. I was in heaven every moment until my last bite.

I do have one quip though: I ordered a glass of cab with my quesadilla, and when the bill came I noticed it was only ONE DOLLAR less than my meal- pardon? The waitress (bartender in my case) explained that it was their only glass of cab, that's why it was 16 dollars. Would have liked to have been warned I would be paying virtually the same thing for my meal, but whatever. For the best quesadilla of my life, I'll cut my losses.
