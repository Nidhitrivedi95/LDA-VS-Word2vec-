CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q Went to Tacos El Gordo tonight.

Anyone whose read any previous reviews know my wife and I are from Southern California so we are constantly on the look out for great Mexican food in Vegas like why you can find in So Cal.

Tonight we went to Tacos El Gordo (E Charleston location).

First you can spot this place pretty easily as the small building is bright pink in color.  When you go inside there is a giant counter, and depending on what part of the menu you are ordering from, you stand in a different line. This is good in theory but a little bit of a hassle, as my wife was looking for Tacos Al Pastor which had no line and I went for Carne Asada which had several people waiting.  The meat is cooked and cut fresh in front of you, and the tacos are slapped together quickly.  I also ordered the carne asada fries.  Once you get your food, you go to a different counter and pay.

Pros:  VERY tasty food made fresh and for the tacos they are not terribly expensive (around 2 bucks each).  The asada fries stood out for me here tho.  Freshly fried fries topped with a moderate amount of carne asada, then topped with shredded cheese, sour cream, cilantro lime sauce and fresh guacamole.  You can order half or full and the full is massive.  They also have a full soda fountain as well as an BANG! Fountain which features my favorite Orange Bang!

Cons: very limited seating for such a busy place, the separate lines could leave your guest sitting with food getting cold while you wait and the asada fries take a bit to come out.   Higher price on some items, as the carne asada fries are $12 which in CA you would get the equivalent for about $8.50.

Overall good food in a town that considers places like Chipotle Mexican food, this place is the real deal.
