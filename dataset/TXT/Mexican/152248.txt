JXiOlujB1i7aZvkNJ9xpzQ I do not understand the bad reviews. The only reason I can come up with is they are fake.  Yes, the restaurant is a bit odd in its location, but the interior decor is quite nice.  My husband and I have been here about 5 times (tonight was one of them), and each time, the service and the food were just delicious.  The margaritas are fantastic!  The staff could not be more courteous and attentive.  We have been looking for a good Mexican restaurant on the east side and this certainly fills the bill.  The chips are hot and brought to the table with salsa immediately upon being seated.   I haven't tried dessert yet, as I am usually too full, but they look delicious.  My understanding is this is a family owned business, so why not give it a try?   We will definitely be back.
