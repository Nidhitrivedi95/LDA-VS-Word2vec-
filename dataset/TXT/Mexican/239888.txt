T2tEMLpTeSMxLKpxwFdS3g This place is incredible - Love that they text you when your table is ready so you can get a drink at one of the many bars on North Davidson while you wait.  Fish tacos are probably the best I've ever had (never been to California so I may not be the best judge), any assortment is good but my personal favorite are the Salmon and BBQ Mahi.  To be honest though, if the fish tacos were mediocre I'd still come for the avocado pasta salad alone- unreal.  Moved away from NoDa in April and still trying to find an excuse to get back so that we can go to Cabo.
