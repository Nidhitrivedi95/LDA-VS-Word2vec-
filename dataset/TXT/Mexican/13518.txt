0LP1QdHGn6ZPZPrG9k3DkQ When it comes right down to it, this is fast food. There was nothing authentic Mexican about it.

On my first visit, I had a beef taco bowl salad. Although it was a pretty mess, it lacked flavour, despite all the toppings and dressings. I hardly tasted the beef.

I ordered a taco trio (chorizo, beef, and pork) on my next (and last) visit. The meat was dry and lacked freshness. Again, there just wasn't enough flavour.

For just a couple of dollars more, I can get much better tasting, more authentic Mexican food in a far more upscale atmosphere.

On the bright side, the place is clean and bright and the staff are friendly but I can't recommend the food.
