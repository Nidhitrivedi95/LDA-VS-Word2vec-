a8pmtlVKf7NiSLI-4KejIw My review is long over due.  I went here with a couple of friends in May and the ambience, food and service was great!  We're definitely returning although my friends have already been there before.  I can't recall what we ate, but we had a bunch of meat and vegetarian tacos as well as alcoholic drinks.  Our waitress was very helpful in answering questions with a sincere smile too.  It was warm enough for us to sit outside on the patio as we were surrounded by a bunch of heat lamps.
