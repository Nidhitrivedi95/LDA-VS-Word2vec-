L2iT7pipc455Tgpbo35_mw Shame on everyone at CASA, including the security guards, that sat and watched a belligerent man hit a woman in the face and did NOTHING.
People. We are human. Remember to look out for one another. We out here just trynnna eat some tacos, and our hearts break as we watch this happen at a place we love. Nobody wanted to step up. Nobody wanted to call police. Everyone just snapchatted, laughed, and instigated this type of unacceptable behavior. I'm disappointed, but proud that my friend I were raised better than to let something so disgusting go by unhandled.

For the record, I have been to CASA almost every weekend. To see people I recognize working and doing nothing about this situation has really left a bad taste in my mouth. It's a shame because out of all the places on mill CASA really has the best drinks and music, but to see their workers so immature about a situation like this WHICH WAS HAPPENING ON CASA PROPERTY is pathetic. This happened on September 18th 2017, so for whichever CASA employee in charge of monitoring this yelp page...I highly suggest you go back to that day and see who was working because they represented CASA in the most negative light.
