We ordered the nacho supreme. This item isn't on their main menu? However, when we made our way up to place our order: we asked if they had or could do nachos. The cashier says "Nacho Supreme", "Yes"!! 

Generally, their nachos come with ground beef & includes as a topping -black olive. Asked for Carne Asada & opted out of the black olives.

Waited about 15 minutes to receive our meal. It came in a round foil aluminum pan. Toppings: cheese, refried beans, fresh guacamole, canned jalapeños, & a huge dollop of sour cream. The chips were extremely thin; not great tasting & looked to be a bagged type- not fresh. The nachos itself even with all those layers were very bland.

They have one salsa that's mild and not to flavorful.

The outdoor patio had a nice appeal with plenty of cool water misters. Cute decor. The BAR is eye catching as you walk through the gate. 

A plus, they do sell beer! Offer two style juices that look to be made in house.

While we ate browsed through their photos & a few of the previous Yelp reviews. Seems this place had more options/ appeal a few years ago that have changed with their new concept after reopening. 

Dinning area is small  & location can be difficult to get in & out of as well.
