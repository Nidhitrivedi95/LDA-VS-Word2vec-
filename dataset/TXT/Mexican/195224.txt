Ouh38adC9WbCRSSyYGtL3Q This place had great aesthetics, but was underwhelming in service and flavor. 

Pro: Chips and salsa were good! Loved the salsa. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time.

Con: It was probably our server's first time working as a server since we had to ask for water and again for silverware. Drinks from the bar were delayed despite the sparse amount of patrons.

The "OG" margarita wasn't bad in flavor, but didn't have any indication that any tequila was in it. My macho nachos weren't bad, but they weren't anything special. 

Hard not to feel "eh" about the place on a Saturday afternoon.
