d_L-rfS1vT3JMzgCUGtiow I think Border Grill is an okay choice if you are looking for a quick and accessible place to eat some overpriced Americanized Mexican food while at Mandalay Bay. The prices are kind of ridiculous. I mean, I guess that's to be expected on the Strip, but seriously? $15 for a portion of ceviche on an averaged sized tostada?! You can get that for literally no more than $3.75 at any taqueria ever. However, it's convenient, the food is okay, and after a long day walking around sometimes you just wanna eat the first thing you can get your hands on. Oh, the green corn tamales we got from the Yelp check in were pretty tasty.
