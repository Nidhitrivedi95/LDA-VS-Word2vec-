WVAvGK24DQ9FdsEHBqIygQ Decided to try this place for lunch based on the decent reviews and was very disappointed. When I first entered there was a bit of a line but I decided to stick it out as I had about 40 minutes before I had to be back at work. While waiting in line I could see a lot of customers that seemed to have been waiting for some time, many of which I could hear were receiving incorrect orders, or hadn't received their orders (and subsequently Mi Taco had lost the persons order all together). Still, I stuck it out as I was anxious to try their brisket bowl. I waited 40 minutes, for them to literally place heated up brisket onto the grill, and scoop ingredients into a container.This should not have taken 40 minutes and the food was less than impressive. The brisket lacked flavour and the entire bowl was just meh. Will not be trying this place again. LEARN TO MANAGE A LUNCH CROWD, please.

Tip: Don't go here if you don't have a full lunch hour, you will be late
