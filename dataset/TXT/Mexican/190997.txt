of4V8nfW7GwJ03tLDdrOlA If you're looking to wait 15 minutes after you got seated to get any service, this is the place!!!! my friend and i walked up and asked for a table for two, the host walked us to a small two seater table and i looked around and asked for a bigger table. she rolled her eyes and brought us to a different table and just stood there. i said i'm sorry it's not that busy right now and she said well it might get busy and walked away!!!!!!!! our service wasn't bad until i noticed everyone sitting 5 minutes before being greeted. a couple sat next to us and nobody came for 10 minutes so they left. the manager, watched them get up and walk right out without saying a word. unprofessional. you are better off not eating. or maybe try barrio queen, because it is amazing!!!!!
