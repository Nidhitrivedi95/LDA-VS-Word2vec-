a9aW5e731lplWGHUZ02-zQ Perfection!  I ordered yesterday what seemed to be the pinnacle of deliciousness.  I ordered the boneless rib burrito with rice and mild sauce.  It was perfection.  Funny thing though .. I was just coming off of a nasty flu bug after 5 days and feeling ok enough to eat something .. I swear, this burrito cured what ailed me.  :)
