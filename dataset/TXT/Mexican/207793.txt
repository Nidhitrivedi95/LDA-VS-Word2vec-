Qb1tuREKTsyVKO6DiDQXgg Store bought taco shells, really? How hard is it to make your own - corn tortillas are cheap and so much better! Jarred salsa? C'mon guys! It's sad to see all of the Gringos' be fooled by this place. It doesn't take much to make really good AUTHENTIC Mexican food. Use real red chile pods to make your red chile instead of the powdered/canned stuff. Try using real roasted green chile instead of canned Ortega! A crock-pot or an olla de frijoles/beans  instead of the gross kind you serve, out of a can, I'm sure will go a long ways! Give something this neighborhood really lacks - AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD. It's at your fingertips. More emphasis on the TASTE of your food, and less on your loud dj/band music & cervezas, although that's about the only good thing you've got going in this place.
