jppxrDQLXr4Nk8cV7IGlcw Disappointed. Quality of food has gone down. Entrees were lacking in rice and beans. Had to search them out. The flank steak was luke warm.

Tostado de tinga-chicken was dry
Huaraches-steak not too tender.
 Toto pas-more than enough chips, where's the rice,beans, pico de galo, and guacamole 

BTW service was very good.
