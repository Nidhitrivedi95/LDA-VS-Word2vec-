2EseSYpIwW6JaA0wUojd4Q OTB's great food is the only thing that keeps me coming back! Service is always terribly slow and waitresses are rude! Drinks do not get refilled and it literally takes an hour or more for food to arrive. I love the tex-mex style entrees, but each time I come back, I kick myself for choosing the restaurant with the slowest service in town!
