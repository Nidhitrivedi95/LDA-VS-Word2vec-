QXA7hvR4mhGwwLCNyRRCXg Sushi was good but too loud and crowded.  There was plenty of empty seats on the other side of the restaurant but they sat everyone on one side and practically on top of each other.  Not sure if I'll return because I enjoy my space while eating and the ability to hear my family while we're halving conversation over dinner.
