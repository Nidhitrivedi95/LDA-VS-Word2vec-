du9EiKx28BVs-2hUAQ3UVg Twice I have visited Cafe Melissa and each time, the entire party had wonderful meals.  The first time, we were there during a very busy lunch, and service was average.  The second time, we went on a Saturday afternoon and the service was fantastic.  
This is the sister restaurant of Sweet Melissa in Rocky River.  While they are known for their pastries, I have never tried them.  The first time, I had a luscious bowl of Ciappino with its savory broth.  I'm sad to hear they no longer have it on their menu, however it now narrows down the items I want to try from 100 to 99.  The second time, I had shrimp with rice that was amazing.  The wild rice had pecans and dried fruit and I just couldn't get enough.
Other members of my party had a brunch item, root salad, crab cakes, buffalo wrap and vegetable lasagna.  Everyone raved of their entrees.  
Ambiance is mediocre, as it was a Donato's Pizza before.  I'm not holding that against them because AL needed a restaurant with entrees that were different and not boring.  If you like mundane, beef and potatoes, go somewhere else.  Happy, happy, happy for this addition to Avon Lake.
