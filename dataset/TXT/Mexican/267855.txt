wKA2y-F_fPcBDOkpzDB9eQ I've visited this place 3 times in the past year.  I'm from California...but whenever I'm in town i make a point to come here. It sometimes has a wait but that's because the corn tortillas are made fresh on site and the micheladas are outstanding! I've brought my toddlers here and they love the chips which are served with a bowl of warm refried beans along with salsa. They have a great kids coloring menu with several choices.  They also have a small bar,  if you're not dining with kids. This visit, the service was less than great and the hostess was pretty inept but in the past the service was wonderful. I will be back.
