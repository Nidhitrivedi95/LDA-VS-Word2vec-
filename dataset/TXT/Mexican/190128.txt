oDxvrLYe5SiQKdJlGhheoA The food was really good, and the environment is fun. We went on a Friday night, so of course there was a bit of a wait. We opted to eat on the patio rather than wait 30 minutes for a table inside. It was nice until people started smoking out there. Apparently they allow smoking on the patio. If we had known that, we would not have chosen to eat outside. Other than that, great food!
