oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ I tried there street tacos bc they were cooking them outside in front of there place. $3 for a good served taco with lettuce, cheese, pico and salsa. Good carne asada and chicken. But plate was super small and couldn't eat it right. Everything fell and uncomfortable to grab a taco. Should buy a little bigger plates. Put a sign that says tacos here! Because a lot of people saw me eating them and couldn't see the place.
