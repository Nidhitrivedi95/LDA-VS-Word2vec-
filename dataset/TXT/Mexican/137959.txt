Iv6G7cDNydPoYLss-uokVA I came to this location after giving up on the Sahara/Sloan location.

I must say, the food is MUCH better! They aren't stingy. Your plate is packed with food, it's all flavorful, they have a salsa bar (no flies!) and the interior design is different from all of the other locations that I visited. The staff has been pleasant and hasnt gotten an order wrong yet.

The adobada and carnitas aren't all hacked up and dry, the tortillas are HOT and the rice and beans aren't bad. I actually have enough food to save and eat later and it all heats up well. This is the Roberto's that you want to go to.
