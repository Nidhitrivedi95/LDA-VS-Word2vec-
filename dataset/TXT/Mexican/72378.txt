cChJhpiljARaINk-dyXGiQ I've driven by this place a million times, not even batting an eye. Decided to stop in today. Food was so good! Service was great, everyone was very nice. I really liked my chicken chimichangas (I'm not a fan of guacamole, but theirs is so fresh, I've never had anything like it), and the rice was tasty. The sopapillas were delicious, but I think my favorite thing was the appetizer queso fundido. Creamy dip with a little kick, served with warm soft tortillas. I would definitely go again!
