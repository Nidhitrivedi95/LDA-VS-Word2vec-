pNSHrFBlwWgTY9es9sdEWA We had the quesadilla montada, and the al pastor and green chili empanadas.

If you like meat lovers pizza, then you might like the montada.  But after 3 bites we found it too cheese and greasy meat heavy.  It's mozzarella, bacon, and carne asada.

The meat in the green chili empanada was terrible.  It was like some kind of really cheap ground beef.  I could't eat more than 1/3 of  it.  

The only highlights were the al pastor empanada and the horchata.  The al pastor was delicious with a hint of pineapple.  I would glady get this again - although there was not a lot of meat there.  The horchata was also very good with a distinct cinnamon flavor.

We really wanted to like the food after reading the New Times review but alas.....
