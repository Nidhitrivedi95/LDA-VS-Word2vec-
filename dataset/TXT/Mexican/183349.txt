NMw6zTXoZDEzNchVIfL1pQ I used to come to this restaurant all the time but each time something has gone completely wrong.

On my latest visit here, they sat me in the middle with a bunch of other people.   What I don't like about the table seating here is unless you are in a booth, you are seated right on top of another table.  There may be 2 or 3 inches between you and the next table which makes conversations open to everyone around you.

So I got over the seating issue and look at the menu.  My server brings my drink quickly and then asks me if I'm ready to order.  No...she only gave me 2 minutes to look at a very extensive menu.  Well it was like 10 minutes before she came back again after that.  

I decide on a deluxe taco salad which comes with guac and sour cream in addition to the salad.  Oh yeah, I ordered chicken.   So it comes out and it's a half-stale tortilla bowl with tons of shredded lettuce, cheddar cheese and slightly seasoned ground beef.  Chicken???????   I received just an additional dollup of guac and sour cream off to the side on top of more lettuce.  Do I look like a rabbit?   Oh yeah don't forget that half frozen slice of tomato. 

The whole thing was so unappetizing and it tasted the same way.  I had to dump salsa on it to give it a least a tad bit of flavor.  Honestly, I've had better taco salads at Wendy's and Taco Bell and I think a chinese restaurant could do better at this.

So I can shoot myself for not going to Moe's like I had planned.  Oh yeah, I thought, this place gets so busy that it deserved another try.  Yeah right...

Moral of this story,, always trust your gut feeling.  The alternative is never worth it!
