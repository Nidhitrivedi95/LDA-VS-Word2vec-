pomGBqfbxcqPv14c3XH-ZQ Went back again about a month after my first visit. I'm starting to see a trend here. Once again the food was great, but service was non existent. I could tell our waiter was busy(only waiter for 6 tables). But, we literally only had our order taken, food brought out and check delivered. Didn't see the waiter but twice. I'm through expecting good service from this place. Not worth another visit.
