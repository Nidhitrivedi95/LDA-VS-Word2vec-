IMoMOGoIDabx_Gnkw4-mmg Cozumel in Independence is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Cleveland area.  This is a local chain of restaurants, and the only other one I've been to was in Brook Park, and I didn't like it as much.  At the Independence location, the margaritas are delicious and strong, the food is good, the staff is friendly, service is quick, and prices are cheap.  Not surprisingly, this place is a big hit for all the business people working in the corporate area of Independence.
