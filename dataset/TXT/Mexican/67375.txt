My hubby and I really enjoyed our dining experience at this Santa Fe style grill. It was an unassuming building outside but clean and inviting inside. The staff was very pleasant and attentive.

I really enjoyed the dark smoky, non-standard tomato salsa with the fresh red, white and blue tortilla chips. I ate the whole thing, chips and all. Delish!

I had the Ocean Front plate. It was a delicious Shrimp Cocktail Relleno that was crunchy with a kicky shrimp cocktail sauce and a yummy Lobster Tamale with a bright, fresh Mango Salsa & Raspberry Chipotle sauce. 

My hubby had the Carne Adovada. Simmered in a smoky Red Chile Adobo Sauce, it was tender and flavorful.

Both dishes were generous and I was bummed I could not make it to dessert.

I do not live very close, but would consider making the drive to dine here again and again.
