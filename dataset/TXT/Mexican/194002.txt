Full disclosure, I'm a huge fan of Latin American cuisine; so they had my attention just by opening the door.  I've visited a lot in the last few years and each time I make it a point of trying something new; I've never been disappointed.  I'd recommend that those who visit be adventurous, there's really nothing on their menu that I can think would offend any taste buds, though you may want to make choices based on personal preferences for types of meats and levels of cheese. :)

The atmosphere is usually quite loud, not only for the open concept full of diners but also as a result of the ever present birthday serenades.  The volume has bothered some people I've eaten with, but I find it's about expectation more than discomfort.  Don't go here expecting a quietly romantic meal with your first date; go here with friends and enjoy the feast-like party going on around you!

If you are looking for a quieter pace, the lunch-time crowd seems to be more reserved and less celebratory; so you might enjoy some mid-day flautas in relative silence; but you're missing half the fun!

Depending on how adventurous your kids are for eaters it's a great place to take them for something new, though make sure you call ahead for a reservation as it can get quite busy!
