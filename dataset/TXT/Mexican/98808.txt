My wife and I make this stop here at Tres Rios at least twice a month. The soft tacos are the best in Pittsburgh. Actually, the best I ever had. We just ate at Round Corner Cantina two nights ago and we were really disappointed. There literally is no comparison. I think it's better than Tako too! 

Tres' soft tacos are hand made corn which they flash deep fry before they stuff them with the perfect amount of meat, crunch, spice and sweetness. It's a flavor explosion in your mouth. I love the Pato (duck leg) and my wife prefers the shrimp. I like the lamb too! 

The servers are friendly. The place is clean. I even stuck my head in the kitchen and it was spotless.

Do yourself a favor, eat a Tres Rios soft taco! If you don't like it, I will pay for your meal (jk).

Enjoy!
