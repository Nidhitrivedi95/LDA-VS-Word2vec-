7GGJlp1aWfcXGQz6q7SkXQ 83 TV's is nice but then it's not so nice. Football playoff's and the half time entertainment had a guy yelling into the mike with the blown speakers : Geeze, back off the mike a few inches at least . As well they did not stop when the 3rd qrt began.
The beer: so-so. A fleck of debris in my pitcher & our server was willing to yes her finger to scoop it out.... So no reason to replace the beer 
Food: bar food and eat it sparingly.
