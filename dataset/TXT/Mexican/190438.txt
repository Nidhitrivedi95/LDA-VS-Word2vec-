oE6gKgUfMd74m77d6hG9qg Too far from me, but my co worker brought some in to work and I loved it. So, since I was on this side of town, I thought I'd swing by and try their other tamales. My fave by far is the green chicken. The spicyness is perfect for me. Guy at the place was really nice and helped me make a decision of which other ones to try. It's just too bad they didn't have the pineapple one until later. Maybe next time. Hopefully they open a store on the west side also.
