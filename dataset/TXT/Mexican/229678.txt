SEjyjYlMfFFzkHaru6JadA After taking a recommendation from our Lyft driver, we decided to give Ricardo's a try. We're glad we did. She had the Camarones Chipotle. Delicious. I had a modified order of Fajitas based on a food allergy. Again, Delicious. The bartender (Ever) and a busser (Luis) were excellent. Luis made great recommendations and Ever's services were on point. A definite must if you want great Mexican food off of the strip.
