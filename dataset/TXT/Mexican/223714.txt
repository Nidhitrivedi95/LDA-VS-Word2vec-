First off, come prepared to wait in line. On some occasions I was lucky enough to order right away especially on weekdays when it wasn't too busy. Service is pretty quick too.
The truth is, the food here is well worth it, people are not raving over nothing. 
You must try the Carne Asada Fries, amazing hangover food and easy to share with friends.
My personal favorite is the adobada tacos, thinking about them as I write this review makes my mouth water. 
This is the real deal authentic taste of Mexico right on Las Vegas Blvd so make sure you try it if you can spare some time!
