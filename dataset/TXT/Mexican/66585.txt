BEplfZTUzYwApjMUaOA12w To be honest, this review is completely swayed by the atmosphere!  As long as the food was decent, I'd have been extremely happy.  This restaurant is contained within the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas, directly aligned with their Grand Canal, with gondolas floating by, gondoliers singing, a ceiling painted with sky and clouds, false building fronts as if you are outside in Venice,.... After flying into Vegas, this was a heavenly place to drop in, get a bite to eat, before driving to a hotel to prepare for a several day conference.  There used to be a different restaurant with an "outdoor patio" near the canal and gondolas, but they seem to have shifted things, so I chose this restaurant based upon it's location.  

They had a nice selection on their menu.  I ordered the Ahi tuna medallions with polenta cakes, and a Sangria swirl type of drink.  I did not want to leave.  It looked like they also had a good menu for breakfast, but I was not staying near enough to come back.  

Vegas is a hectic place.  If you want a little bit of peace and tranquility, this is an excellent choice to unwind and have a bite to eat or drink!
