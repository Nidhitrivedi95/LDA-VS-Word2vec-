yqIVlkpQF_IdhVk1yTiIjw For some reason when I think of Chipotle, I only think of burritos. I forget they have other fresh, healthier options, but I won't anymore. 

After a tip from a colleague, I realized that in a time crunch, I could grab a quick and easy chicken salad that's also paleo-friendly. And although I don't follow the paleo diet, I do like to integrate some of the meal ideas since I'm cutting down on carbs (but I refuse to give up dairy!) 

Anyways, I haven't been to a Chipotle in forever, so once I realized there was one so close to me, I decided to grab a healthy lunch. I ordered the chicken salad with fajita veggies, pico (or the chunky tomato salsa), corn salsa, hot salsa and guac to go. It was delicious, fresh and fast. The best part? I didn't feel like garbage about what I was eating. 

The staff here move quick. I came in at 2PM and there was a line. I was served and rung out within 5 minutes of being there--pretty great in my book. 

Overall, for a quick and healthy (or not so healthy if you please) meal on the go, it works and it's close to me.
