I got enchiladas with rice and the sauce and the queso fresco was literally freshly shaved onto my dish. The margaritas were strong. I highly recommend this place. The chips and salsa was good too. 

Excellent service, pricing, and ambiance. Great for kids and families. There's outdoor seating and it was very busy when we went.
