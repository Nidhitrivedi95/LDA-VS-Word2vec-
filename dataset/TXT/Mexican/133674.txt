iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg The greatest taco place. People will talk about grand electric, carnita, Wilbur, don't listen to them. If you want a taco in Toronto this is the place to get it. It's fresh, the sauces are amazing, and everything on the menu is phenomenal. I'm a huge fan of the baja and the blackened mahi mahi.
