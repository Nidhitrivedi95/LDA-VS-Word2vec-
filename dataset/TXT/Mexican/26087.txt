3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ Great food!! Beautiful atmosphere!! I love  this place and would definitely recommend!!! I apologize to the staff the yelp gave no indication that the kitchen closed at 10 yet the dining room open until 11. I felt like an ass ordering food so close to kitchen closing.  Dulce was an amazing server and took great care of us even though we came in close to 10.  Thanks Taco Guild for an awesome experience.
