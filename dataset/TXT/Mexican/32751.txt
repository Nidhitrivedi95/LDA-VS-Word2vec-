4OUGSeQeASZGn9nSb8Ialg The bartenders were friendly and pretty attentive (it was semi slow when we were there, around 3:30pm on a Saturday.) The decor is inviting and colorful which lends itself to the restaurant's name (sonrisa, or smile.)

The margaritas were good though a little on the weak side, but were presented beautifully in traditional Mexican glassware. They serve multi-colored chips and salsa (gratis) which was a nice touch, as we looked through the menu. We ordered guac (decent) followed by the albondiga soup (good, after you add pepper and hot sauce/jalapeños), and the steak/prawn fajitas (smaller portion than we expected, but overall, good, developed flavor). I was a little disappointed that the beans were refried vs traditional black beans - a sign of Tex-Mex restaurant vs. a Mexican one. The food needed a bit more heat (spice profile), but the bartenders were speedy in getting us hot sauce (Tapatio, Cholula) and fresh jalapeños when we requested. We ordered a few rounds of margaritas, all on the rocks. I would be curious to try their frozen version next time, or simply have their draft beer. 

Overall, a good, casual Mexican restaurant in  Lake Las Vegas.
