atLCqV8RGezSxgLzcM9HaQ If you have never had this place I would encourage you to give them a shot! They have some authentic Mexican food, they are fast, they are friendly, they are affordable, but most importantly they are delicious!I tried the ribeye tacos, and I have never had tacos this good! They make them on small homemade flour tortillas, so the tortillas do not overpower the food.  I love this place and will definitely make it a regular spot! Don't miss out if you like Mexican food, then this place is a must!
