Favorite appetizer: blue corn lobster tacos. They're small but they pack so much flavor in those three bites!!! 

Favorite entree: coffee rubbed filet.  It's got a great kick to it and meat was flavorful and juicy!! 

Desserts were good, not great. I'd suggest getting and extra appetizer or entree instead.
