cwsxAGssF-DBU-Gj9_yg9Q This place is fun, funky, inexpensive and the food is fresh and outstanding! Stick with the quesadillas, though, which are crafted with hand-made corn tortillas. Tacos on Friday and Saturday nights after 8PM. 

The sandwiches also feature a delicious home-baked bread, which is awesome, but just a little too heavy for me. If you've got Manimal hunger, you'll probably dig it.

This may turn into a five with repeated visits (I have yet to try the taco). 

Kitsch indoor seating with a small terrace out front. Go. You'll love it.
