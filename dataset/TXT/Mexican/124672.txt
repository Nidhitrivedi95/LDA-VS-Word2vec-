HQObn6hrV9WoeFObGfa2YQ Great street tacos. If I was only rating the food it would be difficult not to give 5 stars. Didn't even think twice about the pricing ordered more than enough food to go around. But best is saved for last. The owner who went out of her way to point out she's the owner... Who in the world cares... I'm ordering food, eating and leaving bye
