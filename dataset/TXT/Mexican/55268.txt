But over time, they have come a long way. If memory serves, after opening, there wasn't much paint, and it had that middle-of-the-road feel. Now some fresher paint gives it a vibrant feel, and it's as if things are always hopping.

Staff is very friendly, and helps you through the menu. There is a cooler to grab a bottled drink, and of course you can get a fountain drink if that is your preference. Naturally you have the signature salsa bar as well, make sure you don't miss it. Food comes out fairly quickly, though it can be in spurts rather than the entire table at once.

Some of the food is smaller, if that is all you need (see tacos), some of the food is monstrous (see protein bowl or nachos). This is great as it can service you for your personal needs or fit different sized appetites. And while the food as it comes out may be a bit less than you prefer yourself, do not forget to visit the salsa bar!
