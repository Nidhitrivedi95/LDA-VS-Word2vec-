8nNB_yG1gzVpbqNH2EBucg I had never been to this place before. My boyfriend recommended the margaritas as some of the best in town. So I said let's give it a go. When we walked in, there was no wait and were seated right away. The service was a bit slow at times but our waitress was very pleasant. We tried two different margaritas each and they were all pretty tasty.

As for the food, the chips and salsa were unimpressive for being house made salsas and I wish that they only carried the blue corn tortilla chips (unfortunately there were only 3 in the entire bowl...). The cornbread that they serve was surprisingly delicious. I'm very familiar and very particular with my southern styled food. And this cornbread did not even need the butter that they brought out.

As for the main dishes, he ordered the mushroom enchiladas and I the santa fe chicken enchiladas. He said his was good being paired with sauteed vegetables and black beans. I believed him due to the fact that he did not leave much on his plate! :) As for mine, it was okay. The green chile rice they served alongside the enchiladas was not good at all but the vegetables were okay. The chicken itself was flavorful and had an okay spice level. But the 'bbq' they place ontop in the form of a "Z" kind of threw it off.

Overall, it was decent for the price point and the margaritas were pretty tasty. So I cannot think why I would not be back. However, I cannot think this would be my first choice for anything besides good margaritas.
