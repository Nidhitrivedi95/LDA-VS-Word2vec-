K-uQkfSUTwu5LIwPB4b_vg No availability via Open Table but was able to snag a Monday reservation for 4 by calling the Mission directly.  I was asked if there was any special celebration and I responded that we were celebrating my Dad's 81st birthday.  We also mentioned "birthday" when chatting with our waiter.  I was disappointed that there was no acknowledgement or offering of a birthday dessert.

The interior was so dark it was a struggle to read the menu.  This wasn't just a "mature eyes" problem - there was a near-by tweenager using his cell phone flashlight to read his menu.  The place was also very loud making it difficult to converse.  Our waiter was good at adding extra dollars to our bill - we were asked if we wanted our margaritas with Grand Mariner not realizing that we would be paying for both a margarita and a shot of Grand Mariner, and when my dad was asked if he wanted tortillas with his entree we didn't realize that this was also an add-on.  It was very busy and our waiter was not very attentive to us. 

The tableside guacamole wasn't - it was too crowded to fit the cart by our table although the result was tasty.  My father raved about his chorizo porchetta, and my mom and I were very happy with our diver scallops.  My husband's fish entree was also very tasty.  I'm glad we ordered a number of sides as the portions were quite small.

Overall, not the birthday dining experience that I had hoped for.
