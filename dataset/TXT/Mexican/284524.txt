xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw Best fry bread in the world.  I lived in Phoenix and took eveyrone who visited me to the Fry Bread House and after all these years we talk about taking a weekend trip back to AZ just to get our Navajo Taco fix.  My only gripe with them is that they aren't open later, I get that it is a family run establishment however I would usually get my craving around 7pm.  I love this place though.
