XRfMD13CXYMF6601gmfrxw I visited at lunchtime on St. Patrick's Day, typically a slow day for Mexican restaurants. We were seated quickly by a friendly host and served good homemade chips and salsa. The lunch menu was reasonably priced and once we ordered our food was served within minutes. The food was very good. I'm not a huge fan of Mexican rice bit this was very good. Overall this was a great experience and I will definitely visit again.
