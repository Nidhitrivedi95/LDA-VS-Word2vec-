thLX_k20SPJ0KyusGTBIHw We came in for happy hour today (3-6pm) and appetizers were half off.  

We ordered the Brussels sprouts nachos with steak and street corn queso and both were so good. 

What I liked most about here is that they have a rack of different sauces and it's amazing -- I mixed the garlic beet crema, salsa verse and Serrano ranch and eat it with my chips or with my tacos! 

Love the vibe, the way it's decorated -- just everything about it makes me feel like I'm in Miami by the beach!
