_u1Bq7QsgMUXSMex8QHqLQ I feel like the only way to properly enjoy a night out in the entertainment district is to end it noshing at Burrito Boyz. Ignore your inner Canadian urging you to Smoke's upstairs and sink your face into a satisfying, chunky, Mexican heaven roll instead.

I love how the staff have perfected the craft of stuffing as much filling into a tortilla as possible without it exploding everywhere once you eat it. You can ask them to adorn your burrito with a diversity of toppings, then scale according to your desired spiciness level. Then they close it and toasty it up on a flat-top grill. Perfection.

There is also surprising awesomeness to be found in the quesadillas. They took a bit longer to make (probably just because we messed up the flow of things in the kitchen), but they are way delicious.

I honestly just wish Burrito Boyz was everywhere so I could have amazing burritos all the time.
