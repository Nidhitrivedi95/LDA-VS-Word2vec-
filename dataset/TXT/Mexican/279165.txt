XRfMD13CXYMF6601gmfrxw I have been looking for another Mexican place that can put a nice amount of flavor and spice into their dishes without overdoing it, and this place makes that cut!

My bar is simple - Queso Fundito - is it melted or chunky?  Chorizo ground, grilled, and flavorful enough?  Perfect here - order it every time I go! B-)
