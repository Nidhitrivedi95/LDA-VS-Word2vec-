pup46G8qFBG8695RtbQNwA After reading the other reviews, I guess there is no point in complaining about the ponytail-man "owner/manager". We had only recently discovered this restaurant & had been twice in less than a week. My order was not properly prepared (extremely rubbery shrimp) & I returned it & decided not to order anything in its place. I wasn't upset about it, my appetite had just passed. The other dishes were cold upon cutting into but no one wanted to complain any further. Ponytail-man decided to come out of the kitchen, kneel down to eye contact & slowly describe how perfectly cooked my food actually was. It was so bazaar & off-putting. I just said "Ok...?" I was extremely confused at the abrupt interruption, just to argue with me over something I didn't plan on arguing about. After he had made his point, he perked up into a fake smile & said "so what else can I get you?" After he left, the server came up & apologized to us & described ponytail as "aggressive" but since he was the owner/manager, that's just how the restaurant is ran. When we left the restaurant, ponytail cheerily exclaimed "see you soon!" We left laughing & were shocked at his complete lack of self-awareness. Someone in our party even remarked how everything would have been a perfectly normal meal (food mistakes & all) but that the ponytail man's behavior made the night so odd & that none of us will ever be back. Ponytail-man, you win. The restaurant is all yours!
