Yevhl8bTwdJuu_LWKv-4Fw Paladar has a great happy hour menu! Their drinks (sangria, mojitos, and margaritas) are $5 each and they also have an assortment of appetizers that are all quite affordable! 

My friend and I got the yucca fries and portobello empanadas to share. The portions aren't too big, so they're great for splitting with others to try multiple dishes! We also tried the mojitos (I personally tried the strawberry mojito and the regular mojito), which were very tasty! Finally, we got the sweet potato donuts off the dessert menu. I thought all the dishes were flavorful and unique in their taste. Our server was nice, offering recommendations for my friend and I (since we're both incredibly indecisive) and checked in with us throughout our time there to ask us if we wanted more drinks, dessert, etc. 

Overall, I had a great experience at Paladar and I would love to come back to try other foods/drinks on their menu. If you're looking for a new place to check out during happy hour, I definitely recommend checking this place out! They're happy hour is 4-7 pm daily :)
