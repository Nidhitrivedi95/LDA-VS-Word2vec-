7D-ATDP9Ezr1ZehszsotOQ Nuevo Acapulco vs Cozumel:

I tried Nuevo Acapulco this weekend and I have to say, it's very good.  Unfortunately, it did not take the title for best fajitas in Cleveland in my opinion.  That title still belongs to Cozumel!

The margaritas at Neuvo are really delicious and some of the best I've ever had.  Compared to Cozumel, I'd say the Margaritas were a tie.

Nuevo has slightly better hot salsa for the nachos, which I really liked.  

My favorite dish is FAJITAS!  To me, how a place fixes its fajitas means a lot.  In fact, it means everything to me.  For about the same price, Cozumel gives you double the meat, onions and peppers on the simmering hot flat iron that most fajitas are served on.  Nuevo's tortillas were tough when I bit into them, a BIG turn-off for me.  The reason for this is Neuvo serves their tortillas in a plastic bowl with a lid that allows air to get in and heat to escape, whereas Cozumel serves their tortillas wrapped in aluminum foil so they're always hot and moist.  The oppings were the same between the two restaurants - guacamole, sour cream, rice, refried beans, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and cilantro.

Cozumel has several locations and large parking lots that you don't have to worry about your car being towed from.  Nuevo only has one location and it's always busy.  Don't park in Drug Mart's parking lot, you could get towed and good luck finding a spot in Neuvo's lot.

Service at both restaurants is excellent.  Our server at Nuevo was friendly and he even took our guest's camera into the kitchen to take pictures.  Our guest is from Peru, so he wanted pictures of everything here in the States to show his friends back home.

Cozumel's attention to detail, consistent food quality and speedy, friendly service will always win in my mind.  Overall, I definitely recommend Nuevo Acapulco for Mexican, but if you want tip top service and food EVERY time, Cozumel is the place for you.
