EUxbuNT8BYPs_h0vVMy2pg Amazing! I searched on Yelp and saw this restaurant. Since I was craving Mexican food decided to check this place out.

Located in a small strip mall across the road from a Catholic Church, don't be dismayed by the location for this place serves great tasting Mexican food. 

Displayed on the entrance window are the specials in English. Since I was getting food to go I went straight to the counter and a very pleasant man took my order, I asked him how long it would take as I might go outside and wait since the weather was so nice, he told me around 10 minutes but not to worry because if ever he will just look for me to give me my order (what great service).

So My husband and I sat outside soaking up the warm weather, a nice lady came out and brought out nachos and salsa whilst waiting.

After 10 minutes the very nice man at the counter came out with the food I ordered.. He did look for me hehehe 

I just love this place and wish we have this restaurant in Pennsylvania! I will definitely be returning to this restaurant again before leaving to go back home.

I had the tortas asada with con papas ( Mexican steak sandwhich with French fries) and my husband had the beef tacos (it was one of the specials) sorry no pictures as the food got devoured instantly lol.

Please do not hesitate to try this place out, a small restaurant but with great food and service :)
