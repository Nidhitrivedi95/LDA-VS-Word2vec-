0_mJttUgHIzC-NO18gcgBA I have the mole enchiladas which were prepared perfectly. My friend got the shrimp in hot sauce and she really enjoyed it.  The service was a bit slow, but the food was very well-prepared. Also, There is a bean dip it is given with chips at the beginning which is quite tasty. It's not the best place but it's up on the list.
