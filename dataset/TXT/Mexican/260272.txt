vQq_sX0kSAUdT3yLW06q5A Go here for anything with pork in it. Everything else will probably be average. We came here for lunch right when it opened and seeing that the interior looked a bit too dark for a lively lunch, decided to sit on the scenic patio overlooking the fountain. We had the pig wings, queso dip, and I had the shrimp tamale as my main entree.

We were first served glasses of water that had strange bits of particulate in it. I'm hoping it was bits of carbon maybe from whatever filtered water was used and not something more insidious. The queso dip was a gigantic size, and served with corn tortilla chips. While I enjoyed the hearty portion I could mainly taste bean and not much chorizo as was advertised in the menu. The pig wings were delicious, covered in a slightly spicy, sticky sweet sauce with tender meat that fell off the bone. I would definitely get the pig wings again.

I wasn't very impressed with the shrimp tamale. It was a beautiful presentation but I didn't like the moat of sauce covering everything. The shrimp were plentiful and had a good grilled flavor but were slightly overcooked. I didn't really like the corn tamale either, which had a texture that was too grainy for me, and too sweet. 

Service was OK. The server didn't really seem that enthused to be here but she did provide an adequate amount of service. 

I'd probably come here to try some more pork items and to enjoy the patio if it's a nice day, but I'll stay clear of the other items.
