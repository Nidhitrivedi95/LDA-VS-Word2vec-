uLtLJ9sbSYak2WwCb4jjDQ OK so they opened and I have someone very close to me that is VERY addicted to things like escamochas and raspados and such. I get roped into going and I can't believe how much I fell in love with this place. I get the fire cheetos with nacho cheese and the tostitos with Chicharon and Pepihuates....All really good. My kids love the ice cream and I have to say that is not regular ice cream. The cotton candy in particular is very good. Everything appears to be very fresh there and we met the owner. She seems really nice too. I'm really happy to have a great place like this so close to where I live so I don't have to drive really far into Phoenix.
