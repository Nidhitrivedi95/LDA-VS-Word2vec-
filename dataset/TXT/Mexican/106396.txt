I came here just for a cheap buffet, so it is my mistake.  i should know better.  This is like most of the other casino/hotels off of the strip.  Lots of smoke, lots of locals, lots of old people (no offense).  The best part about going here was it was the first time I played bingo in a casino.  It was $6 for 6 sheets, and the prizes were between  $50-$150 a game.  Not bad.  It was my fiancé's first time playing Bingo ever, which shocked me.  I had fun, but did not win a thing.  Lots of smokers here too, be aware.
