nHdsHdq35JflGzliWVqG-Q OMG Burrito overload!!

Delicious food, so many choices for ingredients, but watch out for that hot sauce on the side -Diablo, wow spice!!

The service is superb! It was my first time this past week and the man taking the orders could tell - he knows his customers. He was super nice and walked me through all the options despite the long line behind me. It was a little intimidating at first, but boy was I happy once I bit into my burrito!

Best tip about this place: unfortunately they are only open during the day Mon-Fri, so trying to make it to uptown on a weekday when you don't work in uptown can be a struggle!
