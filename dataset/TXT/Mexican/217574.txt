r8hF3kwnZzxTo1IYNcI6rg Saw this place on the news recently and realized I've driven right by it many times without seeing so we had to give it a try.

Small intimate dining area, maybe seats 40 - 50 people. If you're looking for huge, greasy portions drowning in sauce this is not your place (nothing wrong with that style, this just isn't it). But if you like delicious, homemade, quality food with a nice presentation then I definitely recommend.

Service was great, attentive but not intrusive, recommended mole which was delicious! Wife had short ribs and said they were delicious and very well prepared. Sangria and margaritas were great as well.

All in all a great find and we'll definitely keep in our rotation of locally owned restaurants.
