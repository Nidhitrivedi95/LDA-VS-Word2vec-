1Nq7GxjvEDgAJxBeOjR_9Q Seriously disappointed! Wanted to try them and finally went in. Stood their waiting for service, no one even made eye contact. Just ignored me, not a I will be with u in a moment. I turned and saw about 5 table with no food and knew this was gonna be a process. After the guy walked past the ordering point, looked at me, said nothing, I just turned and walked out! Bummed the service sucked I really wanted a burrito!
