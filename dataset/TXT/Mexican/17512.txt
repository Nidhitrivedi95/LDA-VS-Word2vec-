1JOQhzsW6cu4yVHuPhlRwQ Can't wait to go back! Tucked away in Matthews, it's not much from the outside- but after getting mediocre & overpriced mexican at mi Pueblo too many times we just had to try somewhere else. Drinks&food are very affordable and, most importantly, delicious! I get Chile rellenos EVERYWHERE and am often disappointed- but these were authentic and amazing. Margarita with Cuervo gold (no gross aristocrat) made with homemade mix (no gross bottled mix) was only $4.75!!!! I'm in love, I'll be back ASAP. I really don't want too many people to find this hidden gem, lol, but it was too good not to help them out by giving them a great review ;)
