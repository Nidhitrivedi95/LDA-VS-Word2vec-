cMK38jKxH8x5PvFfAfjZmA The guacamole tasted like it was squirted out of a bottle, the albóndigas tasted like canned soup that they just put meatballs in to call albóndigas the chicken tasted rotisserie and the salsa they serve with chips and beans tasted like pizza sauce, the carne asada was I would say carne Asad-eh.
On a scale of 1-10 I'd give it a hard 2, the service was great our waitress was very attentive and patient. 
The only thing Mexican about this place was the sombreros on the ceilings and the Mexican music playing. 
10/10 would never come again. One and done.
