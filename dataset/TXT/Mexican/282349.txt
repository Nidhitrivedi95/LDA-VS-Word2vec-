XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Having dined at Mesa for dinner before, we decided to stop in for lunch to grab a burger.  Mesa totally rocked the house with one of the best burgers I've ever had.  It was flavored to perfection and juicy as can be.  Our caesar salad to start was also excellent.  The star of the lunch, however, were the Margaritas.  Mesa doesn't fool around with fillers and packaged ingredients and the quality shines through starting with the Tequilla and the fresh squeezed lime juice.  It was a smooth as you could imagine.
