CsS9WsonGYyE3vINi5bxSg The first time I went here on a whim for post-dinner drinks. My friends and I decided to each try a different drink since they are so unique. Upon further questioning, I found out that indeed they were created by the in-house mixologists. We tried the  
Cuban Julep, Habla con Ella, and Winter's Ghost and unanimously agreed the Habla Con Ella was one of the most delicious drinks we've had (we're Manhanttan/Old Fashioned fans).

Upon returning I knew I had to try the food and between the two of us, we had a feast!
Oysters were fresh and served with cucumber juice (unique!).
Tacos - I had the chicken kampungki and fried baja fish (you can also have it grilled) and they were both delish! 
The chips and salsa were also delicious and the ingredients tasted very fresh.

Service was great - I had the same server both times I went and he even recognized me when I came back. 

Will definitely make it a point to come back!
