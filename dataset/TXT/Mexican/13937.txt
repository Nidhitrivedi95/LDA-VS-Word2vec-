0qOI8lOZvvhrbtxqjaBQMg This is the definition of kitchen nightmare! I had to beg my sister to come here with me and I wish I hadn't. The cooks were outside smoking and the lady working the register had to go outside to tell them to come back inside to do their job. They should be shut down for health regulations. I will never go back. 
Go to Fiesta Burrito instead!! Sooo much better!

I literally downloaded the Yelp app just to write this review because how much I loathe this location now.
