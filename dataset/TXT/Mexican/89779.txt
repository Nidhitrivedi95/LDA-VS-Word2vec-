DugcfgyM4DhDldK_jsF0Xw Ordered and went to wait for our order.  First....we notice the entire floor is sticky...then tried to get a table which should not be a problem since there was only on other customer there BUT...EVERY TABLE WAS DIRTY....like smeared with food and liquid.  I told the cashier and a boy came out and wiped down a few of them.  Then our double chicken/mango burrito and chicken salad was ready....both had every piece of chicken was burned, dry and not even chewable.....and no Mango.  We left and are not happy about the $14.04 wasted and still no lunch....my receipt says we were there at 1:04pm Sunday July 24th....we tried it again after a bad experience in 2014 and it was very good in every way...either it is very inconsistent or it has gone back to its old ways
