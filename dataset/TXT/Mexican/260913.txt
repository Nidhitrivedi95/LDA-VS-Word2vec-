VRwT0pscR5vESCrAnUpNwQ Always a good spot to go to for affordable and tasty food. The service is quick and the staff are friendly. No matter what time of day you go, it's reasonably busy so I DO suggest going with at least one more person so that they can find seats while you wait in line. One taco will not fill you, but maybe three will. The charred corn is sweet, juicy and roasted just right. The bowls are a bit customizeable (make sure to check which free toppings you want, as they are unlimited). The range of sauces are offfff the walllll. The avocados are allllways ripe. The chips are a bit salty (each taco comes with a side of chips), sooo the guac and cheese sauce are NECESSITIES.
