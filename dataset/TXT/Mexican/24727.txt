2xMKHQP1TVGB-_62gDOzDg Nopalito is a great little taco shop that is cheap cheap cheap. The chips and salsa are AMAZING, quite possibly best in the valley. Mehi cokes are also muy delicioso.

But for a taco shop that is based solely on it's meat, Nopalito falls a bit short. This place is super authentic and their burritos are a tortilla filled with meat and.....meat. Beans and rice on the side. Super authentic sure, but not so great if the meat in the burrito, or the taco for that matter, isn't the greatest. If Nopa invested a bit more time into their preparation, and the meat they served was better, this place would easily be 5 stars.

I will however, eat here again.
