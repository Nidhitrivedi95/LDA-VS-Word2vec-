HOlDxrYqfoJrVq2Eo-_LKQ Every Wednesday meet up with friends for noon lunch. This week...Farmer Boys, one of three in Vegas. 
I bought the daily special, barbecue chicken wrap, comes with onion rings and a soda, (I chose water). 
My wrap was ok, bland a bit but for the price it's a decent sandwich. Onion rings were bland too. 
My buddies burgers were good. 
VERY friendly and professional staff. The customer walks up to counter to order which takes time after choosing a long table for us. No menus are available at the tables. 
It's a decent place but with so many restaurants available for lunch, I probably won't return but there is a good market at this price and location near dense population/day time business to be profitable.
5stars for staff. 3 stars for food.
