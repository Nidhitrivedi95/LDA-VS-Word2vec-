k8gsrz7gunXPYlOvDfJNBg One late Saturday night, I came across this 24 hour joint. I proceeded to order the carne asada fries in the drive through, which ran me $9.50 with tax. Staff was friendly and had no issues giving me a couple extra sauces. The red sauce was probably a 1/10 for spiciness-very disappointing. The food was expectedly mediocre; the portion of fries was large, but the amount of meat, sour cream, and guacamole was less than generous. This was certainly not worth close to $10.
