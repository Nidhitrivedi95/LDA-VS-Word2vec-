WlBvw6R1Qe2yIaZp-2ilZA My wife and I have been talking about going to Toros for dinner for quite sometime. Lat night (Thursday) we took our partner and his son (from Holland) there for dinner.

For a Thursday night there were quite a few customers there but we were seated right away. Let the experience begin!

Our server, Rene, was very pleasant and very accommodating and the food.....wow!! This was the best Mexican food I think we have ever had. Starting with the presentation and ending with the unending flavors of each dish. Chef Ricky's knowledge of cooking everything properly and knowing "what works" spice wise is unsurpassed!

We will defiantly be back for more!!
