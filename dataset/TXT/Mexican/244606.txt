TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag So glad I finally had a chance to try La Plaza's tacos.  Authentic and tasty, reminded me of a vacation we took to Mexico.  

Certainly a no frills place.  The tacos are simple, made with just meat and a tortilla.  We chose chicken and it was a great choice. At the toppings bar you can choose from onions, limes, cilantro, 2 salsas and a fluid guacamole sauce. 

 These are not the tacos you will find at Taco Bell, but thank goodness they are not
