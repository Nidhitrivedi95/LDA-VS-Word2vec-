-1VaIJza42Hjev6ukacCNg Delicious food and great ambiance. My only complaint is I wish they had better or more spaces to park as it gets crowded here quick. Otherwise the staff is friendly, the food is served fairly quick, and the restaurant is cute with a nice Spanish background. Also, the food here is not very spicy but still packs a punch of flavors.
