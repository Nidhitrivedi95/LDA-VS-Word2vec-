They were packed when we came for lunch on a weekday, there are different line to order different types of tacos so it's kind of a cluster and you'll have bad memories of waiting in line at the post office. Trust me, it's worth the hassle and if you're with someone else split up and each get in a different line. The tacos are amazing, the adobaba pork and carne asada were both some of the best I've had in my life and they're dirt cheap compared to most places on the strip. Ordering here is an ordeal but it's worth the effort for awesome tacos.
