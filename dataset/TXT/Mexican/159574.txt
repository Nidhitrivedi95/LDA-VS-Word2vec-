kUICYu0N_TbtCz0Z8ynPFw Ya...tbh no!!! You thought!! We all know u skimpin us "chipotle" or so you like to call yourselves. Fess up. You purposely train your employees to fill the bowls LESS than normal bc the place b packed. Think we don't notice? Try again we do!!!!! I have a petite figure and I finish this food in one sitting with no problems. At other locations the bowl is a meal and a half for me. Stale chips but Bottom line 2 stars because nobody ever looks my way when I fill my water cup w sprite
