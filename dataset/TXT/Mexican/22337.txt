2IvrdAb6zdxr3ZqplqJHbg Just ate At the express to go window: Over $20 for a subpar quesadilla and chips. They advertise using a picture of a scoop of sour cream and Guacamole, but don't be fooled... you get a 1/2 teaspoon of sour cream and no guacamole. They are fast but kind of rude. You're better off at Burger King or Starbucks when waiting on your flight. I can't believe I wasted $20 for something not even as good as Taco Bell.
