VMeXFzWwBF2PSHx6EpII4A Clean simple little place. Food tasted good had the red chicken, carne asada and rancheros soft tacos. You go in and order subway style...tell them what you want guac, Pico, sour cream etc... quick and easy.
A few days later had the fried rolled tacos.  It's essentially rolled tiquitos with potatoes inside and then they add what ever protein and toppings on top. For me, it was just okay, but it was definitely filling...maybe with different protein toppingwould make it better
