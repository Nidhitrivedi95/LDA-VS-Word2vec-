thLX_k20SPJ0KyusGTBIHw If there's one word to describe Diego Pops....it would be...FUN! It feels like a laid back surfer hang-out spot with great indoor-outdoor seating. 

We started the the mango jalapeño wings. They had a spicy aftertaste but I felt like the overall lacked a substantial amount of flavor and didn't quite live up to my expectations. They were also a little pale in color which made them appear a little less appetizing. 

My husband ordered he beef machacha tacos on a corn tortilla. They were delicious. Both fresh and savory. The side of coconut rice was a little dry and needed more flavor.

My trail mix salad with green chili chicken was delicious. It was robust with flavor, and hearty enough to satisfy even those weary about salads.

Service was as bright and friendly as the ambiance of the establishment. I can see why so many people rave about Diego Pops!
