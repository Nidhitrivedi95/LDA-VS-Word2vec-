aLIJSHJfLQuFu3CamjOS2Q This is a mixed review...so read carefully. Not great chips or salsa...no worries. I don't like to fill up on this anyway and my homemade salsa is exceptional. The chile relleno was recommended and just ok. The rice is nice and fluffy...again...I make better at home. Great lard rich refried beans. Now...where the excellence is found...the grilled shrimp dinner WITH potatoes and homemade flour tortillas.  The shrimp is amazig with  crisp quartered red potatoes with salty garlicky yumminess and the tortillas are not those pastey white store purchased blecky things. The service was ok...the gal was new, so you gotta go with that. Super nice though.
