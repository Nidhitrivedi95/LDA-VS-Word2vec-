LnIO_JtoDS1xLfTHWuV_ug My mother and law and I were hoping for a salad in a tortilla bowl. We asked our server if they offered that, and he pointed out the salad page. Again, I asked him if all if these salads come in a fried, flour tortilla bowl, and he said yes. I ordered the enchilada salad and it did not come in a tortilla bowl. But it was an interesting tasting salad, pretty basic lettuce, carrot pieces, celery, grated cheese, but it had a cheese enchiladas on top that had been dipped in a delicious red sauce. My mil had the vegan platter. She said the veggies-squash, zucchini, onion-where pretty tasteless and there were frozen peas and carrots mixed in the white rice she did not like that. The server did offer to bring her something else but she declined. She did enjoy the pinto beans that were served on the side. This place is close to my home but it's not the best Mexican food I've had.
