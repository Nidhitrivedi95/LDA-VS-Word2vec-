OlA7h9oOttqTALudvEUzTg I'm pretty slow to drop the ban hammer on a restaurant, but I don't think we'll be going back here.

We ordered our food after arriving (burrito suizo with carnitas for me, veggie enchiladas de mole for my wife), and things seemed to be going fine.  The food came out reasonably quickly and the chips and salsa were fine in the meantime.

We did have an issues with our order where they informed us that the "weekends" section of the menu didn't include Friday nights, only Saturday and Sunday.  The waitress wasn't aware of this, and hashing out that confusion took long enough that we ended up getting our meals a few minutes apart.

My burrito was cold and flavorless.  The tortilla was cold enough that it broke in several spots during the wrapping process.  The ingredients were uninteresting, and the pork was an awkward kind of gray.  I will say that the cheese sauce on top was tasty, and I was hungry enough to eat the burrito, but I wouldn't order it again.

My wife's enchiladas were a different story.  They were also not thoroughy heated and the cheese wasn't melted in them.  Despite requesting vegetarian enchiladas and asking some questions to ensure that's what we were ordering, the plate still came with meat on it.  The waitress eventually came back to check on us and we told her about the situation and explicitly asked her not to bring anything else, just to take it off the bill.  Minutes later, another freshly made dish hit the table, and I feel like they just didn't listen to us when we asked for the situation to be handled a specific way.

I left feeling like the service was inattentive and the one food item out of two that was correctly done was done poorly.  I avoided a one star review because the cheese sauce was decent and the chips and salsa were as well, but we won't be back.
