vMKQaR8bI2saI7rz8H5MYg Came here for lunch and the food was okay. The location is great but the dining area needs a facelift. They ask you if you want to provide a tip when you finish ordering your food. I declined and stated I would leave a cash tip. Well there is no additional service other than the cook making your food that you have already paid for. I guess they call you but I heard nothing and my food was just sitting in the counter I figured it was mines because there were not many ppl here. Then my second plate was just placed on the counter and I knew then no number or name was called. You make your own drinks and no one came by to see if everything was okay. So what's the point in leaving a tip? There were four to five employees working this day. I might visit another location if I decide to explore this restaurant again.
