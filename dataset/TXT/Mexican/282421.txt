XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg I wish I could give Mesa Grill 3.5 stars but because I'm a fan of Bobby Flay I rounded up.

The pork tenderloin was truly amazing. The side of corn bread was dry. The bread basket was served cold and a bit dry. Nothing too creative just  white bread with minced jalapenos in it.

The service was disappointing. It was rushed and impersonal. Kind of like a diner. I was expecting much better for a restaurant of this caliber.

I decided to round down. Sorry Bobby.
