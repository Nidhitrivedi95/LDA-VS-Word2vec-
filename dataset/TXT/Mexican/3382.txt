-o082vExIs0VVNSuZmiTQA I've been going here for years, and enjoyed that the chicken Chimichangas don't have cheap fillers like rice or beans. However tonite my chicken Chimichangas was mostly filled with red peppers and onions. Very disappointed and hesitant to try again.
Ajo Al's now appears to now be the only ones to have Chimichangas filled with all shredded chicken and NO cheap fillers.
