tTR9GQbdC-rEHNsECmSWRw Supremely underwhelming IMO.  Boyfriend and I came here on New Year's Day for their brunch buffet.  We didn't want to be useless for the rest of the day so we opted out of the full buffet and just stuck to the breakfast items.

The eggs and pancakes to order was pretty nice, but that's the extent of it.  Everything else is pretty much what you would expect from a hotel continental breakfast.  Nothing spectacular and definitely not worth $25 per person.

I'm assuming the full buffet is much better, since I saw everything from a raw bar to prime rib being served.  However, it still doesn't really seem worth the money to be served food from under a heat lamp. 

If you're a buffet person, this definitely seems like a good one.  But if you're on the fence, just sit this one out and order off the menu.
