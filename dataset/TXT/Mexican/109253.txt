fS1QBwuCUXVQ_K7LNnYvBg OK. I have read the reviews and I'm somewhat baffled. This is still better than the multitude of Mexican places in this city that have ground beef as the main course. The steaks are great, but you have like skirt, or flank steak to appreciate this. The drinks are so cheap. The chips and salsa are very good. The alacarte stuff is the bomb. I think when the owner was there day in and day out it ran a bit more smoothly. But I have only had one bad meal there. Compared to the rest of the ground beef laden Mexican joints in this city, this is still far superior! Chingona buey!
