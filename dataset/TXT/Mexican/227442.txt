S3-JpB5dBhMXmauMqeoN-g All these years I have gone without knowing about chicken huaraches. I highly recommend ordering the Mexican sandal plate (huarache). The dish comes with masa (dough) on the bottom with beans, cheese, meat, sour cream, and avo on top. I also ordered chicken and steak tacos with beans and rice, which was yummy as well, but nothing to remember like the huarache. Initially I had asked for grilled chicken, but they only have shredded chicken, which was amazing! It tasted like they had my grandma in the back kitchen cooking it up.

4 stars because the horchata tasted like someone just threw a cup of sugar in the milk. Where's that cinnamon at? I'll pass on the horchatas and keep it simple with some water.
