- cheap tacos that are stuffed with goodness
- variable flavours and creativity in their dishes
- gluten free if you want it
- fresh, hot and right to order
- two is a huge meal

The bad: 
- usually a huge, noisy, zoo of a line up
- nowhere to sit (but hey, who can blame them, their rent is cheap which keeps the tacos cheap)
- their ceviche -- it's just not very flavorful or interesting

Avoid the mexican sodas if you're not into super sweet things because they're way sweeter than Canadian/American soft drinks.
