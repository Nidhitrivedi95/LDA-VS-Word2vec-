Rj-7ymdw8aNZBRqGRAjR3Q The food at this place is delicious, my only complaint is that our food was cold. I had the Baja fish tacos which I really enjoyed since they were deconstructed, most places serve them already put together which makes them soggy. These were crispy and the tortillas were hand made. I also had a mango margarita which was really yummy! If I ever go back I'll be sure to ask them to bring our food out hot.
