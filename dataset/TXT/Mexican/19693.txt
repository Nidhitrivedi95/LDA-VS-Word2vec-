1x8_aJQ-iqvymhRK3SNbLg I had street tacos and they were just okay. I eat tacos all the time so these ones didn't have anything special about them (not to be rude). If I had to pick I'd say I enjoyed the barbacoa the most . I usually love Al Pastor but the flavor and texture was unbearable to me so I gave it to my boyfriend. While our server was very nice and friendly, she was super inattentive. It seemed like she was the only one there running the bar and serving which I understand but we were in kind of a rush.. and we also saw two groups come in and then eventually leave because it took too long for them to be acknowledged. We were seated right away and got our drink orders in.. but after that it took twenty minutes just for her to come back and take our order. Another thirty to bring it out .. and another thirty to forty five minutes to bring the check. I did give a couple stars because the tacos were 99cents when we went in and that's a good deal for a group .
