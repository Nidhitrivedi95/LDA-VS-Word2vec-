cUFBO-5Fgd7pR0JUakWXSw The Mission restaurant is a five-star hit and is my go-to for lunch or dinner whenever in Scottsdale. The modern Latin cuisine is fresh and fabulous with a fun, innovation, and unique twist. The ambience is elegant, classy, beautiful, and romantic. There is both indoor and outdoor seating.  The service was fun and professional. The salsas and tortillas are homemade. The meats are prepared on a plancha using mesquite and pecan. You can smell the smoke from the fabulous wood before you enter the restaurant. The tableside guacamole is prepared with the ingredients you like and to your desired level of hotness.  Unique ingredients such as EVO, chipotle purée, cotisa, and roasted pepitas made the guac absolutely delicious. We loved both the crispy rock shrimp and Tecate skirt steak tacos. We adored  the espresso churros with the accompanying Ibarra Mexican chocolate milkshake. There is a very nice offering of tequilas. It is hard to make a decision here...everything looks and sounds fabulous!  I cannot wait to go back!!! Reservations are recommended for lunch and dinner.  www.themissionaz.com
