e2ApirIzYID9xIye0r_gKQ My first time trying Farmers Boy and I was not one bit impressed.  My husband and boys would always mentón how good this place is and the burgers so they decided to let me in on the experience.  The way I can describe it is by saying that we could have gone to McDonald's, purchased the same thing and paid less.  Literally.  I ordered a burger with jalapeños on it,  got sine regular burger.  I don't know what was going on with their "sauce" but it was a very watered down version of macsauce. I asked half fries and half onion rings I got decent amount of fries and 1 onion ring.  = McDonald's issue with orders always wrong.  Not impressed at all.  Peru upset actually because I could have gone elsewhere with my money and gotten something that was actually good.  The ONLY positive was the service.
