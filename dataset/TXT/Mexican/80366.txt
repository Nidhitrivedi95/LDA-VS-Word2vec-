cYhv7XVpqJIpb6BLzZBaFQ My family and I love this place. Is the food good? Yeah, sure. It's great, but it's pretty much what you'd expect at a Mexican restaurant such as this. But there are several other places in the area where we could get the same meal. But the staff is what brings us back again and again. These people are friendly. We're there fairly frequently and the waitresses are chatty and excited to see our children. The staff acts as though their genuinely exited to see us there. And perhaps they are! 

Just a note, the place does fill up quite a bit at normal peak times and there could be a bit of a wait. 

And yeah, great margaritas.
