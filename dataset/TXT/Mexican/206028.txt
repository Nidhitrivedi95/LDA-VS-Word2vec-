PytxYN64H5Mn-PRSEymb4A Stopped by the other day for dinner. The staff was nice and friendly.  The fish burritos were quite large and filling. Lots of good flavor.  We really liked the fish tacos as well. Good portions and quite flavorful.  The little salsa bar is a bonus. 

 The only minus was that the corn tortillas were really bland - tasted like cardboard.    It doesn't do it justice to put all that delicious fish and fresh ingredients on a very low quality tortilla.  Next time I go I hope they upgrade the tortilla - then I'll give it more stars!
