OxS3vO6dFwkCz_Zjl71M-w Seriously, this is probably the second best Honduran restaurant in the country (The first one is located in New Orleans). I moved to Charlotte a few months ago and being the true Honduran that I am, I was hoping to find a great restaurant that provided me with a good home cooked meal since momma isn't with me. Well, gotta tell ya' this place is it. By far, their food is waaaaay better than anything you can find in Miami, FL. "Hey, Miami Honduran restaurants, take note." They offer Mexican and Salvadorean food, but since I'm not Mexican or Salvadorean, I can't speak for that cuisine but I would say that the Mexican/Salvadorean dishes were good. I love having breakfast/lunch/dinner at this place. The taste is very authentic and the service for the most part has always been great. The restaurant is clean and the staff has been friendly.
