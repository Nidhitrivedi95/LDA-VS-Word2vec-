-bMZCfTK7fxFaURynKpBMA I was working in the area and was hungry for a traditional ceviche. Found this place on yelp and did not look like anything special from the outside, but WOW! Amazing ceviche, great service and great prices!! Nice and clean on the inside as well. I will make sure to come back next time I am in the area. Todo muy rico!!!
