mB_cI1tCrNxxvr2e2myNrQ I am a huge fan of Taco Bell in general! Their food is always so delicious and innovative as well as incredibly affordable! I got their new chicken nachos. Though I was admittedly hesitant, I actually thoroughly enjoyed them, especially with their yummy nacho cheese dip. I always add in hot sauce to their cheese to add a bit of spice. I got their $5 cravings deal which is honestly such a steal, including a burrito, gordita, taco, nachos, and a drink! I also got a pepsi slushie (not with alcohol) which was amazing, especially amidst the Vegas heat. Everything was so good!

But what really makes this Taco Bell is the environment. With the DJ upstairs, the fun decor, the shining lights, the aura was amazing. It is definitely a place where you can jam to and just have a ton of fun without having to be 21 or having to be drunk. This is the place to go in Vegas in my opinion. Also the DJ that was there when I went was absolutely killing the game.
