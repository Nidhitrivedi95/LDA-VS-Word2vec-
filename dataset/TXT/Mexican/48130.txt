89uU51kOiQXbJHVA3C6XMQ I'm writing this follow-up to dispute what another reviewer wrote about the original Carolina's in south Phoenix being better than the new location in north Phoenix. The north Phoenix location on East Cactus Road was a much better dining experience. The spacious, airy and clean restaurant allowed me to enjoy the food much more than I could surrounded by the nauseating impoverished sights and smells of the original location down on E. Mohave Street.
