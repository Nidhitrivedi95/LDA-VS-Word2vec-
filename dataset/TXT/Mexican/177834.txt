muefnimyq_3KIdEouJFvrA You hear that siren?!  We got a quality weiner alert in the desert!  YesSir Veza's thank you for offering a Sonoran dog that I would actually recommend to out of towners.  And it's also a good place to watch all the televised games on college Fball Saturday or NFL Sundays!

What grabbed my attention always walking past the food court was their Sirnoran Hot Dog had a 100% angus all beef hot dog.  I shoved it down my pie hole and enjoyed every bite!  Oh of course there's the onion rings....beer battered but batter fell apart on a few so perhaps I would pass next time but they were A-OK.  

Yes I know there are other places around town that serve the Sonoran Dog BUT well let's just say they all looked down at the floor when I ask about what kind of weiners they use!  Yea uh huh sure that's right go ahead and shove that craptastic junkified Oscar Mayer ding dong up your hoo hah where the sun don't shine!  

There was a time when "Back in the Days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore but some days I wish I was a kid again" I could care less about what's in my hot diggity dog and would only focus on taste and flava only.  Welp the name Sirnoran Dog is well deserved cause I crushed it like a Sir, like a gentleman, like a boss yessirey indeedy!  I'll be back for HH specials!
