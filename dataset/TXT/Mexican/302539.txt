zwNC-Ow4eIMan2__bS9-rg Are you kidding me, four and half stars. First thing we noticed, there was no A/C in this place by the way it was 110 outside. Then we ordered one burrito and two tacos. Al pastor and Carne asada meats were real bad but buche was OK. 

I am not sure who writes the other reviews but for sure I will never come back to this place even for free.
