fbQaKW0Lte0JQ_opbnjdKg I highly enjoy this place. You get a lot for a decent price. The layout is similar to subway and chipolte where you make your own thing with what you want, but in this case with ENCHILADAS! You can pick between corn and 50/50 corn and flour. Honestly i wasnt expecting them to be so good. I ordered 2 and really i only needed 1. I tried their tacos as well which were amazing too. Again i got 2 tacos and really that was enough. 
Tacos 4/5
Enchiladas 5/5
Short rib meat 5/5
Chicken 4/5
Pork 3/5
Cornbread 5/5 - fill your enchilada with this! Best ever.

Its a nice mellow hangout spot and i will be back because the food is so good!
