wKA2y-F_fPcBDOkpzDB9eQ Order the Prepriado! Micheladas are my favorite and they're delicious here!!  Foods always amazing!!  The lunch specials is a great deal about $10!  M-F 11-3. $4 tostada fills me up!!  Love love that they serve beans with fresh made chips and salsa!!  This is my toddlers lunch!!  The steak fajitas are a favorite!!  The seasoning is so flavorful and makes the onions and peppers super tasty!!  I've ordered them mixed but I prefer the steak!!  Service is always great and the food comes out in no time!
