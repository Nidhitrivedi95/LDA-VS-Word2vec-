WB8BmFMORvshjb7tBw0e0Q We have tried Azul a few times before and decided to go back with friends.  What a wonderful experience.  Crystal, our server, was fantastic - friendly, attentive and well versed on the menu.  I had the chile relennos with the pork and it was excellent.  Our friends had the fajitas and enjoyed them as well.  Guacamole made table side was also a hit.  We will be back!
