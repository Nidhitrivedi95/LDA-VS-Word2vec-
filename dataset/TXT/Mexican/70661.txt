c_XbaJqhm-5ycSBOkVUBmg This place is very average, nothing really wrong with it just not spectacular. Prices are decent too. Best taco here by far is the Lengua (tongue) probably sounds gross to most of you, but the meat is very tender. Problem they only have it half the times that I go there. Also on tuesdays they have a 99 cent taco option, which is basically a deep fried taco with ground beef and some cheese which is alright..
