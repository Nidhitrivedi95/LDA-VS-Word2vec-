gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw Enjoyed awesome impromptu team dinner here yesterday.  Wine list is extensive, we selected some yummy Spanish reds.  When the staff wanted to seat another group at our high top table, we were given complimentary bubbles as a thank you.  We enjoyed a number of dishes including the corn lollipops, tuna ceviche, empanadas, calamari, and guacamole.  I split the skirt steak with a teammate.  Lovely! Would go again!
