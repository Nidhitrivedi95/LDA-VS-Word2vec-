SEjyjYlMfFFzkHaru6JadA We had not been in years and forgot about it until this weekend we had our child with us and wanted a great place for kids and not a casino environment (smoke) so we went here...and I was not disappointed...it was great I had the Fajitas... and the appetizer lobster flautas....OMG GOOD !!! My husband had the carnitas...(thumbs up) And the Margarita was HUGE!!!! and VERY tasty....Had no idea it was open 24 hours...so we will be back if we are hungry on a adult trip next time (wink wink)
