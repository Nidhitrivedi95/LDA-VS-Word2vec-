DaTQLers4x_DbGPi7r_xVw This is the place to go for authentic Mexican food. NOT La Carnita's! Food is priced fairly and they have beef tongue tacos! They also have amazing pork shoulder and chorizo tacos. Tried their guacamole and chips which was pretty solid too. Forget Sneaky Dee's and the like - this is the place you want to go!
