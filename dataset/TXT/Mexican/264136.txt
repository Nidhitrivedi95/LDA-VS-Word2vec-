Wbi-x-1Nbn6LFCMOSN6F5Q Food is always tasty and I never complain but.....I went to this Cafe Rio on Sunday Oct 5 for dinner around 7pm and they were running out of a lot of toppings especially the cilantro lime sauce which is the only reason why I eat there in the first place!!! They have two types of salad dressings: a cilantro lime and tomatillo ranch. I repeat! Only 2 dressings! How could they possibly run out? It's called make some more! Anyways they also ran out of the Mexican white cheese and guac it was ridiculous. I think it was an off day for them or poor management, I have no clue. I'm giving 3 stars because I love Cafe Rio, the flavor and portion size but Sunday was not happening!
