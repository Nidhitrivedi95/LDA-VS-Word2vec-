9IZX6ctv4ea6mc9gzu1flQ Absolutely love this place great food good margaritas!! We always come here but it seems to be the lady who seems to be the MANAGER? Dis likes us not to sure if it's because we are a younger couple? Not sure what it is we are a easy table to take care of we know what we want from the menu we share a medium margarita and that's it.. today we ate there she treated us like shit and we watched her at other tables and she was very polite to multiple tables and they messed up on my girlfriends order and that made it as if it was our fault!! We always tip 25%+ we know how it is to serve for a living... I think if she would treat all of her guest equally she would have a line out the door every night like la ristra!!
