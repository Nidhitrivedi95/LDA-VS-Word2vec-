scLvLqVVIOWZbVT-exGjjg My family and I ate here recently, the food was delicious! First off, I really appreciated the staff let us sample each of the different meats since we had never dined here before. My personal favorites were the shredded beef and the chorizo. I ended up ordering a quesadilla which was four HUGE pieces. I was only able to eat one, plenty for leftovers or a meal to share between two people. We also shared a side of the queso which was enjoyed by all. Five stars for Carrburritos!
