BAzzSM3zMyYDDwJqgAwZVg After our first visit here we were anxious to come back and try out more of the menu and drinks. Our 2nd visit was not at all like the 1st. Our waiter started out with a long list of things they were out of but luckily only one of the things we wanted was on the list. The food took FOREVER to be delivered. The few other diners seated near us kept looking at the watches and were very irritated. Another party sat down, looked at the menus and then after waiting and waiting for someone to take their order, got up and left the restaurant. The food just wasn't that good either. Portions were skimpy, food that should have been hot was cold, and my street tacos fell apart when I picked them up. Ended up having to eat them w/fork.
So we decided to give it one more try...it is a local business and based on our 1st visit, I really wanted to like this place but it wasn't to be. Third visit was almost identical to the 2nd except that all four members of our party ended up sick (we think from the ceviche or salsa since it was the only thing we all ate some of.) I definitely won't be going back.
