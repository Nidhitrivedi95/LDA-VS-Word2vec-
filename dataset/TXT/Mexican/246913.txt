tXqaK0lBEE1XJbzDPsdFvg I've been to farmer boys numerous times, first time at this location. I had the pastrami, which was a bit smaller than expecting but tasty. I would like to mention the great service I received with a packed place during lunch time. Manager and staff were prompt and accurate with my order while keeping up with the other dozens of customers in the place. Also super friendly. Would recommend this location over others for their staff.
