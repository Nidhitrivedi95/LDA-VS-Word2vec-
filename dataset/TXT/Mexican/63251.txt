ayaDm0WPZB0g0PYbGFkrzA Finally tried this place but it was bad! Beautiful atmosphere, strong drinks but small.No big luscious salted margarita to be found! Not what I expected. Overpriced! Service was decent but slow! If you want a great hot plate of mexican food with rice & beans you will not find that here! Food was not  good. Cactus on the tables were fake...food felt fake as well..I call them like I see them!
