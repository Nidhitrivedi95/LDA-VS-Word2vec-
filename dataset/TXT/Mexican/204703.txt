pugciBzSCFqa_vn-X5pcEQ The best part about this place is that there are so many topping options with great flavors that you can make the style of Mexican food that you want. You want street style, they have the Cilantro, Onion, cucumber and roasted salsa for that. You want creamy Cilantro dressing for a fresh Mex flare, they have that too (similar to cafe Rio flavors.) You want bowls loaded with corn and rice and meat and beans... They got that. Every thing we tried was delicious!  My only complaint is that a la cart was high in price, you have to get a plate to get a deal.
