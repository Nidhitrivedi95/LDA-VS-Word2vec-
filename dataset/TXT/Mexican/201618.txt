pKTIxpM_2Qk7l_Kb0LImbQ Assembly line struggles so bad every time I come in this location. They literally didn't have a huge order together which made the line super long and the manager and cook took a break. So weird. 
Also they give you no food. Like why do I have to beg for more food because your employees put half of a scoop. 
Sad cause I love this food but I can't pay for an empty plate and long wait
