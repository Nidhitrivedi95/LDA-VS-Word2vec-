KMxOoHyRKP74PgosuRkkdg I discovered this place while driving to Long John Silvers, don't get me wrong, I love that place but I changed my mind last minute and ended up here. As I go through the photos on yelp, I seen that they had elotes (Mexican corn on the cob) and was excited! (Also their tacos looked good) but I got the super nachos and the corn in a cup. What a disappoint that was! The corn in the cup was super runny and soupy, the cashier asked if I wanted lime and I was like sure but however there was too much. The lime flavor with the soupy crumble cheese corn on the cup was a turn off and that's surprising because I believe the "recipe" of the corn is simple, too simple to mess up yet I was proven wrong. This is the first time  I was actually dissatisfied with corn in the cup that I only took 3 spoonfuls. Even in Los Angeles at the Garment District where they have street food and the corn in the cup, it isn't made THAT watery. After that I was hoping the Super Nachos would redeem this place but it turned into a flop as well. I did notice the Nacho Cheese machine but still went with it anyways because I never really experienced anything bad from that machine nacho cheese. I stress about the nacho cheese (lol) because it did leave a nasty after taste, you would only experience this after taste with cheap cheese. They could of least hooked it up with whatever cheese they use at Taco Bell, come on now. However the steak was good and the guac was good on the nachos, I was pretty much hungry at this point so I split the nachos in half and ate them regardless. We ordered 2 corn in the cup and nachos (she says it can feed 2 but..I think 1 person) 2 drinks, came put to 21 dollars...I wish I could go back and change my mind to continue in route to Long John Silvers. I believe this place just opened so maybe in the future I will come back and try their tacos.
