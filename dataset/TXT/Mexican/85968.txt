Db3CfZWrtG33UZSs8Tdlsg So many great options!!  Fish and shrimp and vegetarian options!  But you don't get free chips unless you order a large side, which is WAY too much queso for a large family even.  I actually didn't like any of their chips or salsas.  But the shredded chicken and fish tacos were incredible.  I'll go back for those.
