cKgUCzMGuRgkbKXUsgeXUw In a word....disapointing. The wife and I ate here for lunch and I was very, VERY excited. Not from the yelp reviews per se, but from the menu. You see, I love me a good taco, and with over 60 to choose from I was very pumped.

However, Barrio Queen just fell a little flat for us. We ordered the cochinita, the carnitas, milanesa reggie and chorizo y pollo. Of the 4, the chorizo y pollo was the best. The cochinita, while good, didn't quite hit it out of the park for me (I LOVE cochinita) the carnitas was super dry, the milanesa, which is breaded and crunchy, was also dry and lacking overall flavor. Good, but not great and not what I had hoped for.

Then we ordered the green chile beef and the tlacoyos. If you're unfamiliar with tlacoyos they are....well.....similar to arepas? Not really sure how to describe them but they are generally awesome and while these were OK it, again, wasn't what I was hoping for. Very little chicken with the dish and the tlacoyo's themselves (the little cakey/tortilla type thing on the bottom) wasn't substantial enough. But how was the green chile beef you ask? Salty. Very, very, salty. 

$37 bucks in all before tip just added to the disapointment. I really hope this place does well, and I do plan on coming back to try more of the tacos but overall...disapointed.
