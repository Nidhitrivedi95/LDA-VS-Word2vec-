WVAvGK24DQ9FdsEHBqIygQ As someone who had tacos in Mexico and San Diego, the tacos at this place was definitely legit! 

I got the taco combo with carne casada and the shrimp taco with beans and rice. Food was reasonably priced and service was great. They got lime water on deck always so that's a bonus! 

Also it's a small family owned place, rare to see that in Toronto so will definitely be supporting this place!
