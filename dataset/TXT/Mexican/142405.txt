jDQIKfsfJU3M8M6n0ESKFg Not the rating I wanted to give however, this is after our 3rd attempt at eating Carolina's.  Our first experience was during the 2nd week of opening.  The first few weeks were lines out the door.  Expected for a new spot, but looking back now, I can't say why so many wanted to try their food. 

I tried their mini chimis and flautas.  Very basic and nothing exciting.  We were hungry and had no idea what would be worthwhile trying.  Unfortunately, the meals were nothing special and pretty boring and lacking in any flavor.

The second time we tried they were not nearly as busy...only a few weeks later.  Tried a red and green burrito enchilada style.  Dull dull dull, no flavor and certainly not red and green, more a bland brown shaded green or red.  Tasted like they had forgotten to add any flavors what so ever.  

The third meal was yesterday...this was disgusting.  Only way They could have saved this order failed also....here's why.  We got there at around 2:30. We both ordered Carne Asada Burrios.  They only come with Carne and Pico ...  we added sour cream guacamole rice and cheese...this did not save the flavor or add to it...I couldn't even finish my meal.  We watched for over 30 minutes while the entire food line left the floor (perhaps a team meeting?) regardless, our food sat on the counter for what seemed like the entire 30 minutes.  No one to tell the cashiers that the food was sitting there getting cold the entire time.  I was hoping that their "famous tortillas" would save me from writing this, however, they were a huge waste of money and quite ok honestly not even the same as what was used on our burritos.  The tortillas taste like flour-bland as can be. 
Because of this, I will never go back--can't say I'd want to waste another $20 on food there or even $5-just not worth the time or disappointment.

Horrible and never going back.
