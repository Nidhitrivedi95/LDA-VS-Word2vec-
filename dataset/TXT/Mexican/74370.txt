cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A I've wanted to Try Chino Bandido since I seen it on tv a few years ago. Finally went with two friends today.

Ordering: Way to complicated. I ended up getting Combo, Teriyaki chicken ( safe bet? you'd think so) fried rice and refried beans. Side refried bean and cheese burrito, drink- $14.95 Combo comes with a cookie.

Teriyaki chicken- sauce was good, chicken tasted weird. Fried rice was not good, at all. Refried beans, very tasty. So the small beans and cheese burrito was good. 

Should Fried rice and refried beans really be allowed on the same plate? I now know that answer...No. It looked like I cleaned out my fridge and was eating up leftovers that don't match.
The Cookie was good.Staff friendly. Place was packed. I won't review for my 2 friends but neither want to go back, ever.
