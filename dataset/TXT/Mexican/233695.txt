stMft_Zx7r42l9UlVFaLjw As an update I figured its been 4 months since my review i've been happily going to other locations. But I was in a geographical bind, So I thought id try again... 

Lol with little or no customers in the store. 

 They give me half my order again....I have to ask for the rest of my order.. lol its just sad. Ill just drive over to streetsville From now on where it never happens.

Food is good ,staff is nice. they just cant get things right there and dont pay attention. Which means lack of management.
