frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A A great taco spot can be judged by the salsa. I pony up to the La Condesa salsa bar and prepare to judge. Today's salsa varieties included strawberry, cilantro, guac, and my fav a spicy salsa with tamatillios. Spicy, complex, AUTHENTIC, developed flavors exploded in my mouth as I sampled a rainbow of salsa with the chips that arrive before my tacos. Instantly, I could tell,  La Condesa Gourmet Taco Shop knows what they're doing in the kitchen, they care about quality, and are super fresh.  

If Mexican food can be judged by salsa, a good Mexican restaurant can also be judged by the frijoles. These beans did not disappoint. Great flavor, perfect consistency, delicious salty cheese on top. MMMMM! 

The Main Event: Tacos. Yay! Roasted Veggies: Awesome! Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco: WOAH! My lunch buddy declared: "This is as good as my favorite taco stand in Mexico!" (She lived there for 6 years!) How's that for authentic?! The Horchata may be the best in town. Definitely homemade, with strawberries, mmmmm. Not too sweet or watery. I can not wait to try the fried quesidillias.  

With food this delicious, decor may not matter, however the inside is cozy & clean with heavy wooden tables and contemporary chicano art. I especially love the doors to the banos. 

Prices are completely fair, cheaper than a combo at a chain restaurant. Meal for two with drinks was $20.

Taco Row is one reason i struggle with the thought of leaving the southwest. Salsa and tacos this phenomenal are difficult to recreate too far from the border. La Condesa, the new kid on the block, is worthy of praise & adoration.  i look forward to a long, delicious affair.
