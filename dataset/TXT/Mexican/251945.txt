uQDVjBcG6t3t-5hSQnZ4lQ This was probably the worst meal I've had in a restaurant in quite some time. I'm not sure if this is primarily a lunch place, but when me and my family went on a Saturday evening the only option was the tacos. We ordered a variety - for every single on the the meat was dry (as if they had prepared earlier in the day and we were served what was left) and the meat was unseasoned. Maybe if we had gone for lunch the food would have been better. 
On a positive note, it looked nice in terms of a casual place to fine with friends.
