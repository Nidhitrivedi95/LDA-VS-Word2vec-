DO5mQxiBOgHEznosjxvJXw Las Vegas is home to a plethora of mediocre Mexican restaurants, but this is definitely NOT one of them!  The food and the service can only be described as upscale, and even though it is more expensive than the local neighborhood, it is definitely worth the price. I had the carne Asada chile Relleno, and it was superb. They roasted the pepper and stuffed it with carne Asada, mushrooms and cheese, but skipped the usual batter and deep frying. This produced a much lighter, yet still hardy dish. The rice and accompanying sauce were excellent as well. 

The chips and salsa were obviously made on site, and the guacamole was some of the best I've ever eaten. I finished the meal with a wonderful flan that I know I'll have on my next visit. 

Service was excellent all around, and it's hard to believe a restaurant this nice is located in the (recently renovated) Boulevard mall. Make the trip; it's definitely worth it.
