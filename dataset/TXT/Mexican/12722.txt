Requests for more salsa were not fulfilled. There was obvious miscommunication among the staff. We were charged for random items on our meal, like salsa Fresca. We were constantly out of water. A to-go order for 1 person took more than 30 minutes due to the fact that they did not call out names. They entered the coupon incorrectly. The menu stated different ingredients than what was found in the meal (a burrito said to have just chicken and beans also contained lettuce and rice). I understand everyone is new, but my experience makes me not want to come again!
