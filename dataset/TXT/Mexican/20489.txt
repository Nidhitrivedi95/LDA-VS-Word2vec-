24MgaUT4TWO3_kZQlBu8sw Paid extra for 2 servings of guacamole since I felt like the 1st portion wasn't enough. Order was for takeaway and once I got home I realized the guacamole wasn't good. Love chipotle guacamole and disappointed this was sooooo salty I couldn't eat it. Called and they apologized...the meat was also off and more fat than usual. This restaurant isn't consistent. #sad#reallywantedchipotle
