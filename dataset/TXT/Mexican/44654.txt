7m1Oa1VYV98UUuo_6i0EZg Stopped in to PVB after seeing it on Guy Feiri's Diner's, Drive-ins, and Dives on Food Network. It was delicious. The location is nothing fancy, and neither is the decor inside, but the staff was friendly, quick, and professional and the food was amazing. 
I ordered the Burger Brûlée which had a fried egg, bacon, onion, burnt sugar, and havarti cheese, so far, I haven't had a better burger in Phoenix. As a side I also opted for the sweet potato tater tots, again, not disappointed. My coworker stayed simple and ordered the Paradise burger and fries, she said the burger was worth coming back for and I tried her fries and the in house seasoning they use is very yummy, no dipping sauce needed for flavor! 
Looking forward to returning to explore the rest of the menu.
