R6cWq0FkVfV_Ee-YttlPyA On our way back home, we decided to grab some lunch at this joint. Seemed convenient enough for a filling meal before the flight. Michelle was cashier. She got a little sassy with us during our interaction as if she wasn't interested in doing this job. That was bit of a turn off. 

Don't expect much from this place though. Food is alright, nothing amazing. I got the Carne Asada burrito for $9.79. It's a little pricey but certainly expected for airport food. The burrito is stuffed with steak, beans, salsa, onions and cilantro and served with rice and more beans. It was good enough for the day. again, nothing that stood out. 

That's all I have to say about that.
