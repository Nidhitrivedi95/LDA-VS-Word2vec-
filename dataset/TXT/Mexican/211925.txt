They have friendly and attentive professional staff. I have been here close to 100 times and I've never had anything but a 5 star experience. This is my default joint on the west side of Vegas. Can't say enough good about this place or the food. Melody, Eric, Nick, Alex, David, Sam, and all the others make for an all star cast worthy of the most discerning clientele. 

Can't wait to come again next week for another perfectly cooked filet bordelaise. I'd put it up against any of the other top steak houses in this city. But most of them would lose, the others would be lucky to tie.
