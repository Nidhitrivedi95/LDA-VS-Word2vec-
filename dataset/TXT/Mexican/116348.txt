GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog No complaints about service. They were very friendly and still willing to serve us 30 minutes before closing.

BUT, their food was horrible, OVERLY SALTY and inconsistent. When Pigs Fly buns were drenched in salty bbq sauce, dan dan mian was the frickin' same. My first shrimp taco was very good, was the only thing I approved of so I ordered 2 more. WRONG MOVE, they didn't come out looking like the first, they were drenched in some disgustingly overpowering orange sauce that tasted like melted salty cheddar. Even their fresh guacamole that was made in front of us was salty... and the chips were already salty enough to begin with. Done. Never again.
