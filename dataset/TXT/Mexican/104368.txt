fdS9moyk-R84-DgY5xrCRg I almost cried eating my taco it was so good. The mango and pineapple salsa was to die for!! I got the corn and flour tortilla, I prefer flour! Pollo Oaxaca was so flavorful and the carnitas was heavenly. The staff made ordering way easy so just talk through it with them and build your own, they offer suggestions too! Love the reasonable pricing and food came out quick. COME GET YOU SOME TACOS!! Bowl is good too, but I'm a taco girl!
