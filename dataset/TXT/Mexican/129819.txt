I779CNMLWhZu6BxkGfLvwQ A group of friends (6) met at Smokin Fins last night for happy hour - what a fantastic time we had!  It was our first visit to the restaurant and we were not disappointed!  We sat at the bar - Josh - was our bartender & server and Nate, General Manager (their "Yelp" names) - both did a phenomenal job of keeping our food orders coming, which was probably no easy task, as we tried a wide variety of items.  We began with oysters on the half shell - they come with a couple of sauces on the side and you have the option of dressing them or eating them plain.  They were tasty, fresh, and delicious!!  Moved on to the Avocado Crisp, which is like a small pizza with shrimp, avocado pieces, and a yummy sauce.  The steamers, in a white wine sauce, were very tender.  We had to share the Buttered Crab pot - this is definitely a "to be shared" dish - the crab was nestled in a old- fashioned Mason jar soaking up the melted butter.  It was served with toasted french bread for dunking - almost like eating crab in San Francisco!!  We will definitely come back again and again and continue making our way through their menu!  Thanks for making our Wednesday night enjoyable!!
