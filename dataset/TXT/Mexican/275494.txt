XDYCIRENiT2doRZgwNJ3SA Tried this place because La Bonita, in the same parking lot, didn't have carnitas ready yet.  Pepe's Carnitas burrito...  huge thumbs down!  This food is terrible.  Carnitas are very dry & bland.  I almost thought it was chicken at first.  Rice was dry and old.  Beans were pasty, almost couldn't even get it down.  More expensive than other places, not as good and not as much food.  Service was friendly & quick enough, regardless the food was so bad I will not be back and wouldn't recommend it.  Next time I'll wait for fresh carnitas at La Bonita, or even go to Roberto's (which is a bit overrated, still better than Pepe's).
