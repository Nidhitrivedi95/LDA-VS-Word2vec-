3te8dGIvzz5V5_kMIr6-Dg Stopped in to try one of these vegan burritos after reading all the glowing reviews. Never very good at making decisions, I asked for a burrito made of half bean, half TVP. The guy at the counter was super friendly and accommodating, and I was eager to dig in to my halfling creation. 

The first few bites were great -- the texture was meaty and the taste was interesting -- but as I continued eating, I found the burrito to have a pretty flat flavour profile, and I felt a bit "heavy" afterwards, even though I couldn't even finish the hefty burrito. I wish there was something like a scoop of guacamole or a bit of cilantro to round out the flavour and add a bit of freshness. 

Also, it turns out they don't serve the donuts that other Yelpers have been raving about anymore! Big disappointment.
