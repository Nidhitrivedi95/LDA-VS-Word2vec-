AM0NHSxMeX92OKBt0ywmSA Came here on a Wednesday night with a group of friends. The majority of us did not even realize this location existed. So we were pretty excited as we've had good experiences with the college location. Unfortunately, we left a little disappointed.

We tried all the different tacos including the Wednesday night special shrimp one. Being the special, we expected some great things. Unfortunately, it was not the greatest. It was soggy and the shrimp was rubbery. There were no tacos that really stood out. If I had to pick one to recommend, it would be the carnita. The flavour was decent. The ceviche was ok too. 
Whatever you do, don't bother with the churros. It was so disappointing. It lacked flavour and the texture was weird. It was as though it was re-fried. To add insult to injury, the order included 3 but it came with 4 and we thought we scored a free one...but no we were charged extra when the bill came. Funny thing is we even told the server we didn't think it was our order because we only just put it in and it was for 3...oh well. 

The staff were great. They were attentive...maybe a bit too much though. They were like napkin thieves haha Every time one of us went to grab our napkins, it had already been taken away. I understand tacos can get a bit messy but we went from having a pile to none at all because they kept getting taken away if it was not flat on the table. 

All in all you are better off going elsewhere for tacos.
