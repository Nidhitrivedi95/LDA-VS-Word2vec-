VIJ2KiDKhUVhhpNylEIfog very good campus food, much better than we had a few years back.

food is a bit on the salty side, but the portion is great. if this were to be compared to the mexican places we had in chicago, i would give it a 4 star just because there are more options in the city. given it is a quick eat between classes and its close location to campus and the food choices around here, this is superb
