Ln3jC2yAs5KtopUDAhYZBA It's not often I'm impressed with a fast food joint, but this place did good.  Yesterday I went to the drive through to take a burger home for dinner. Long story short, one daughter working, the other at a movie with friends, the wife out of town.  I'm on my own....no need to cook a meal.

The girl at the drive through was friendly and courteous.  Food was prepared relatively quickly, and the best part is....they got it right! I got exactly what I ordered! That doesn't happen often, so I'm happy to write a good review for a burger place.
