WyeENX8AdrERdFZtVy7uzQ Me and my husband have been here twice in 1 week. It's definitely a good place to come when nothing else is open the 3 mini tacos are great although a little on the expensive side compared to other taco  places. Their customer service is average really don't care to remember their customers. The restaurant itself is not dirty you will be able to eat inside without a problem. I think its a great place to get Mexican food when your hungry in the best is closed!
