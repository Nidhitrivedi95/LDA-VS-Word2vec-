bU6IZNKS7NcFVfZppkTHAg I've been to Cozumel before, in Independence, a number of times, and I think they are one of the best Mexican Restaurants in the area. So, going to the one in Brunswick, my expectations were high. I gladly proclaim the Brunswick location to be the equal of the Independence location. Actually, I think it's even better.

The staff was very friendly. The food was delicious. Salsa is fantastic. Absolutely Five Stars!
