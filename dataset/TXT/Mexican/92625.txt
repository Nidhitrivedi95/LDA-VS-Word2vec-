e13SEvJud_vgeDR_doL4sQ My husband and I visited Hussongs 4 years ago and we were instantly hooked! The original Margarita, free chips & salsa, and a great variety of Mexican food favorites!!!! And they even offer veggie & vegan friendly options! WOW! The managers Chad & Steve always make us feel welcomed and appreciated. We live in Southern California and we purposely make a visit to Vegas every couple months just to eat at Hussongs. A must try!!! You will not be disappointed.
