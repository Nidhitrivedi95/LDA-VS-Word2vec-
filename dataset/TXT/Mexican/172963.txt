mES9E5K4HbYoPFXGv0pUuw Went for lunch with a friend today. We ordered the fish taco meal and the chips and salsa. 

The staff was very friendly. We managed to get a spot before the place quickly filled up. 

The chips were nice and crunchy but a bit oversalted. They're quite frugal with the salsa but I guess that's what the salt on the chips were for... 

The basa fish was quite bland and soggy. Even after adding the guacamole and salsa that comes with the meal, I found the tacos boring. The salad with the meal was very salty and barely edible. 

Overall I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. Maybe they slipped up on the seasoning today but even taking that into account I've had much better tacos downtown Toronto.
