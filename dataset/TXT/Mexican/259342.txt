Voeq7aGDmCGMjE_SQiHwRA Wow!!! Gotta tell ya folks. Awesome food & service. The duck liver pate' w/Sauternes Gelee was to die for as a starter. Smooth, creamy and I would spread it on myself and lick it off. Beverage menu selection was as craft as they come. Whiskey selection is some of best I've seen. We came with our dog and they allowed us to dine outside with him. He helped us finish our marrow bone app that was spot on with the orange zest. Wife got the cavatelli & I got the smoked lamb neck. Spot on with flavor profile.  
Don't pass this one by folks.
