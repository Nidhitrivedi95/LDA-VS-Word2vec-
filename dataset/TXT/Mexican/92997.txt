e2ApirIzYID9xIye0r_gKQ Went out for my lunch break decided on a salad,  I ordered at 1:33 PM per my receipt I have waited a total of 30 minutes for a SALAD. This is unacceptable . it has grilled chicken on it ! that seriously what I'm waiting for, with it being a to go item how is it 4 vehicles went through the drive thru and one car even ordered salads!  I will be deleting the app and will not go back to this restaurant as I will never invite anyone to try it either!
