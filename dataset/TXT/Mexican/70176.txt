BWmex2gxmeWWFwb6hjKm5Q I have a secret love affair going on with Qdoba. I'm a weirdo though, and I seriously only get rice, beans, sour cream and cheese on a whole wheat tortilla. But, Qdoba still loves me despite my oddities. I fork over my cash, which can be pretty steep for what I'm getting, but I do it anyways because that rice has magic delicious dust in it or something. So much so that I'm writing a giant runon sentence over it. YUM. I always go later in the day, so there is no line, and the staff have all been very courteous to me. I think they may have switched to new people since the last reviews were posted, and I cannot attest to the chicken. But I'll go there as often as I'm in the area. I could literally eat there every day. EVERY DAY.
