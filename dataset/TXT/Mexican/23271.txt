2lF1UsGcDpDpaI1lXgRX_g On Tuesday 1/03/2017, we stopped into our favorite "Mexican" restaurant for lunch. The reason why I used " " is Mexican restaurants in AZ are Americanized. Abuelo's is one of the best as we dine here often. We arrived before Noon and ordered Guac Appetizer and two orders of Chile Rellenos + soft drinks as it was early in the day. We love their thin and warm chips with Salsa. Service is always great and attentive. The restrooms are always clean and checked often
