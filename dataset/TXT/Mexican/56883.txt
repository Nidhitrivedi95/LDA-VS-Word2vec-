a4l5DquJhAPeEH0vpWoBWQ Awful service - Go to Zapata's around the corner.  

Full large Margarita spilt on my lap tonight.  When I complained that it wasn't taken off the bill (at least...enough years waiting tables myself to know that's worth a free meal) the manager said it was because they were short staffed (...I'm not seeing the connection?!?).  This wasn't the only incident tonight, just poor service that didn't want to be there or help us.  Even though we've been there a dozen times (for the food), we will now drive past it to hit Zapata's.
