XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg Mesa Grill was very good however it wasn't mind blowing. I expected to be whisked away to some amazingly delicious Iron Chef Bobby Flay land, alas I was not. I had the Lamb Porterhouse with Tamale and sides of Spinach and Sweet Potatoes. All was delicious - we first sat at the bar to wait for table. Bad thing no draught beers here - only bottles. The bartender handed us breadsticks, which had a nice spicy element. After a 45 minute wait, we finally were taken to our table. The waiter was nice however did not give us the lowdown on the fare, as a typical establishment of this type is expected to - maybe he was too busy?  When the food arrived, the lamb was cooked a little under, however seasoned well and had a nice spicy kick from the serrano peppers on top. The sweet poatatoes were sweet and had a nice firm bite, not hard or raw. The spinach also was good.

Overall the food was good but not impressive as you would an Iron Chef restaurant to be.
