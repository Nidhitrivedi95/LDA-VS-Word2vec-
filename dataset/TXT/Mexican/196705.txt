Went there last night for my husband's birthday and it was so disappointing! Made reservation day before. We got seated and waited about 15 to 20 minutes to see if anybody was even going to acknowledge our presence. At that point we went back up to the hostess and asked if anybody is working in that section. Three waiters were just walking by for next 10 minutes trying not to make eye contact and still no service. Finally different waitress came and she was nice. Food was good too. After dinner we waited at least 10 minutes to get my cc back.
it was just very disappointing because it was his birthday and beyond terrible service ruined the whole dinner.
