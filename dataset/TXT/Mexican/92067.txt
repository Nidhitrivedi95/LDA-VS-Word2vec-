E_DXCeVllZtHV93hsAIZvw Came here for the first time and I must say very impressed! I'm not even from Phoenix and I can say these are one of the best tacos I've ever had!! They serve their food fresh and hot off the stove! I had a taco of carne asada and pastor! Must mention their sauce is very good as well! Wish I had more room to try more! Will deff be returning to try more off their menu!! This place is a must try! Very reasonable prices!
