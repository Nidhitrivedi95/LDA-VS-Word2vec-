dAcaMSkrpYUZocqrLvOzRQ Los Cabos was pretty good. We stopped in for dinner, not really knowing what to expect. I had hoped for sit down service, but you order at the counter and then grab a seat if you so desire, which is fine. The workers are extra friendly and very helpful. It was a good dinner, I'd come back. I think next time I would just grab takeout for lunch/dinner.

The menu is your standard authentic Mexican dishes. And it comes out extra fast, and warm and delicious. I did an enchilada combo and it was so yummy. I also had a hard taco on the side, but I would pass on that next time. It was shredded beef, but honestly, I prefer a low-end taco bell-esque ground beef concoction.To each their own. We also received complimentary chips and salsa for eating in, so don't bother ordering it. 

It was amusing that they don't play Spanish music, but instead just play Discovery Channel shows in Spanish. Counting Cars is great with a Spanish voiceover while chowing down on some refried beans. Dream life at Los Cabos.
