We had barely touched cheek to vinyl when a waiter presented chips and salsa. The salsa was really good-- a bit garlicky, fresh cilantro, smoky chili flavor. The service remained extremely fast and very friendly. 

I had the mahi mahi salad. The fish was a bit well cooked, but obviously fresh and tasty, covered in a mild chili sauce. The salad was topped with fruit and lovely, lovely, oh yeah, chimichurri. Herself had the kid's beef burrito, which featured really tasty ground beef (yes, I know, whatever) that was very flavorful, and not drenched in sauce to the point of soupiness, as at some places. Mon cher chou had a chicken enchilada-- again the chicken within had some tasty seasoning and sauce, but was not drenched. And yes, the margaritas were huge. 

NB: f you want to eat here, go at an off hour. This was once an old Pizza Hut. There are only about 20-25 tables, most of which only seat 4. There is always a line out the door Thursday-Sunday nights.
