iIjVO7cLD1UEmIO7G05Ujw No further explain is needed. This place is THE authentic Mexican restaurant. I felt like having a nice dinner in Mexico. The mole sauce was the best!!!! Menudo was unbelievable. Every single item I got in this restaurant was beyond my expectation. I wish I tried the Mexican bread pudding but after eating all the food I was too full. The salsa sauces are extremely hot! Flan was tasty. I wish they open another location in Boston.
