7-Ba9uSmYYpXgnQRoIPxMQ Havana grill is the place we always go in Vegas. The husband is cuban and definitely let's his eyes and heart do the ordering. We always end up with a table of food and he says it's like his grandma used to make! I suggest the croquettes, tamales, riquimbin. But is authentic and great.
