8iVd6gMWKGGU9SL55B4vjg I love this place!! Some of the things that others have complained about are what makes it awesome to me. The fact that I can order and pay before I get my food is a plus to me.  I HATE being ready to go home and have to wait on my check. Then wait on the server to come and get my card, blah, blah. You get my drift. I don't mind getting my own drink either, and the food is delicious!! I'm not a huge Mexican food person, but I think about this food all of the time. Chips and guacamole are excellent. I have had the mini chicken chimichanga, which is far from mini, a chicken burrito and chicken enchiladas. (Anyone noticing a theme here?). I love, love, love their red sauce it isn't spicy, but it is so flavorful. It is my favorite thing about this place. The food here has a LOT of flavor, unlike many Mexican restaurants. To me most Mexican restaurants have food that all tastes the same (equally bland/greasy/bad). Not the case at Los Chiludos. Also have a good Margarita. Definitely one of my favorites!
