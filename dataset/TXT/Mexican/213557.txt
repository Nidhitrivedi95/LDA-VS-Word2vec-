qWi9dNGo9D9I4F9RANc-6g My favorite restaurant. Well, possibly a close second to Momocho :) We go quite regularly and are impressed to see Chef Eric Williams running around there most of the time. 

Every margarita, every guacamole, every main dish, every side, and every special we've ever had here are incredible, I recommend it all.

Top recommendations: Orange Sesame Guac, Cuke Margs, Rooster Claw Margs, Wild Boar Taquitos, & the fries

The atmosphere here is also my favorite: hopping, yet intimate. And service is ALWAYS great, it's obvious they're a customer focused group.
