I3STZd5iAvUL9MNLF_DUug I was very disappointed in Blanco tacos in the Phoenix airport. When we sat at the bar, the bartender and older woman (Mrs. Collins- I only saw her last name) did not even greet us. She placed beverage napkins in front of us and just looked at us waiting for us to order without giving us menus or drink options. We asked for menus and I ordered a margarita (which turned out to be the worst Margarita I've ever had- it was very sour and I watched her pour the tequila...she put a drop of patron and little Jose Cuervo.) She didn't return to get our food order so we had to flag her down and she ordered our food and never checked back. I couldn't drink the margarita because it was so sour and she never came back to check on us so we flagged down another friendly bartender who quickly made a different cocktail and helped change our experience (which is the reason I'm giving 2 stars opposed to 1)
