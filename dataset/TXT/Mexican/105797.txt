fIpGcpjBnyiILi8M2wJSUw First off, this is in a sketchy area but don't let that scare you away from having awesome food!  Went there and had the best al pastor tacos I've ever had. They serve them with a side of Nopales (cactus) which is kind of unusual but I guess that's how they do it here. These guys are from d.f. (districto federal) if you don't know, that is Mexico city, so these guys are the real deal. They serve the tacos with pineapple and grilled onions and a grilled jalapeno. I haven't tried anything else on the menu but from what other reviews say the food is bomb. (That means good!) you need to come here and try them you won't be disappointed! Oh, they only take cash so be prepared! There was an English speaker there when I went but another review said there wasn't one there, (no matter to me I speak both) but still, do not let this scare you away! Oh and their sign reads:
Tacos del trompo..
