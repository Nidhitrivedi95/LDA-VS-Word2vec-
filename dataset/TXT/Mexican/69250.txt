bQ2uuNkOxgUQRM7Y7RJDXQ Came here with my family after seeing Yelp reviews. This is less than ten miles from my house but I had never been. My grandma is a second generation Mexican American in need of some good Mexican food. We are always hesitant when in east Mesa when looking for good Mexican food. This place did not disappoint. 

First off their happy hour is until seven and all Mexican beers are three dollars. I ordered the Chili Rojo de Pollo. It was amazing!! The chicken was shredded beautifully and spicy enough to keep me going but not spicy enough I was overheating. I couldn't eat enough of it. It came with rice beans and a tortilla. Service was great and pleasant. Food came out fast. This is a spot I will definitely come to again.
