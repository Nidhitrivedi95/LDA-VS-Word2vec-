a8pmtlVKf7NiSLI-4KejIw Excellent ambiance and atmosphere! The restaurant is masterfully designed. 

The food however was really heavy, drenched in thick sauces, and mostly fried. There was no emphasis, everything just seemed to be piled up on top of each other. The ingredients were repetitive, and we had to send back a few dishes because of how bad it tasted.

Do not order the pork skin! I am surprised any restaurant could get away with selling fried (tempura) pork skin that has NO taste at all. 

The ingredients are fresh but poorly utilized, they seem to throw guacamole on everything and a hint of lemon zest.

I asked for a Caesar and they brought me a bloody mary! 

Overall, I wouldn't go back to this restaurant.
