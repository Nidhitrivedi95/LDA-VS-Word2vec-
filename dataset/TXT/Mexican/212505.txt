qRUEQowj9yuV-HFwm9wZXw Looking for good Mexican food in Goodyear, skip this spot.  There aren't many Mexican place in town, I know, but this isn't going to make up for it.  Bland food, with lots of rice and beans as filler. It's also a little over priced for what you get.  My opinion, but good Mexican food should be the simple ingredients that have flavor to them (marinated meat, corn/flour tortillas, beans, maybe rice), and not have to drown them in salsa to get some flavor.  Overall, this place doesn't do it for me.
