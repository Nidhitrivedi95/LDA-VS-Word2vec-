TG2QAcrevOmXDuCQQFlGew You have to know where you are going to find this place. Located in a terrible location on the end of a strip mall, and behind a gas station. It used to be Mike's, but he couldn't survive the poor real estate. Fortunately the food is worth the hunt. 
I visited on a Friday night, and the place was busy. It's a little Mom and Pop restaurant, so more than a few people is busy for them. I tried the chicken burrito which was large and very tasty.  This is restaurant quality food, on real plates, at fast food prices. I have read some reviews claiming high prices, but I think I paid about $6.95 for a chicken burrito enchilada style, which is about what I would pay at Filibertos. Daniels also includes fresh chips and salsa with your order.
The staff was all very friendly, and the service is good. The only thing I would caution people about is that if you go during a busy time, you may be waiting awhile, because it's a little place, with a small staff, making each dish when ordered.
I do wish they had some more chicken and/ or fish dishes, most of the entries are beef.
