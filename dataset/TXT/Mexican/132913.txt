iGEvDk6hsizigmXhDKs2Vg I'm giving four stars with hesitation.  Part of enjoying food is have a place to eat.  We were forced to stand in a hot crowded room.  The chicken taco had bones in it, one star.  The three others we tried were pork, spicy shrimp, and spicy pork with pinnapple.  All at least 4-5 (the pork shoulder had a lot of fat on it) stars except for the the tortillas.  They needed additional grilling and fell apart.  We tossed them and ate the filling.  Because of the rush eating we won't we back.
