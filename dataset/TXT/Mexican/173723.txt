mJFdBXviC-1YRtY51XnS6A Blackened shrimp tacos on wheat tortilla made me so happy! Friendly, quick, and delicious. Amazing food for any price. I'll be back! My husband enjoyed the chicken quesadillas and my daughter the beef burrito both said their entree was delicious. I read someone said the food was just ok. I think they need to visit again because the shrimp was tender yet firm, flavorful without being over seasoned. The sauce was tasty and the produce was fresh including the guacamole.
