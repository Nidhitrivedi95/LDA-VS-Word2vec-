_xiUV8OfR6yUJk-09QD6zA I'm not sure why theres so much hate for this restaurant but considering that utsg tends to lack many good restaurants (unlike ryerson) I was considerably impressed with this and I began coming here often.

They recently renovated and now they have better displays for the menu. I asked for a bowl of hybrid (steak and chicken) and it came with everything I ever wished for. Usually guac costs money but these guys give it to you for the meal. What really stood out with the meal was the sweet corn that they sprinkled. man its so good. They recently got new sauces for the bowls which include garlic and some other sweet sauce which gave the bowl tons of flavor. 

I will be coming back soon and they are very nice and respectful to their customers. Keep up the good work!
