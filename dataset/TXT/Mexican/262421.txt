vz8HFGsITt6aj-nyXkAEFg Very happy we stopped off and tried this place. Not sure why more people rate it higher.  Starts off with three homemade salsa's and chips.  Salsa's are great.  The guacamole is just a great as salsa. 

One meal was Pollo Fundido which is a chicken burrito deep fried with a homemade jalapeño and sour cream cheese sauce. Wow was it good. The chicken had a really good flavor and large portions.  Retried beans have to be made with lard because they are fabulous. 

Second meal was Cheese enchiladas meal. The green sauce stood out more than the red sauce even though both were great. Beans and rice was had great flavor and compliment he combo. 

Over all great food and will come back over and over. Try for yourself. Won't be disappointed.
