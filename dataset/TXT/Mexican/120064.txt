Gx1i3fXHzKkcPYrxTCGeoQ What can I say... It's just Taco Bell.  Hehe.  This location is closest to my home & I come here more often than any other taco bells in Henderson or Las Vegas.  Especially on my way home & i'm starvin'.  I don't eat here too often though.  The workers here are very upbeat when going through the drive thru which is nice.  I ate in there once & it was a normal experience.  You order your food, get it, then eat it! =) Food is pretty consistant & orders are always on point.  I haven't had any problems w/ the workers or anything.  They all seem to love their jobs I guess.  ^_^ They don't show that they hate it there like other workers at other fast food places do.  All in all.... it's a good taco bell location!
