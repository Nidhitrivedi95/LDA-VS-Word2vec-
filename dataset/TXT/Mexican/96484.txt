eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw Our party of 6 went here Saturday night. For some reason our waitress forgot to put our order in and left the restaurant. After about 20 minutes waiting for our drinks another waiter went to check as our waitress was no where to be found. They were clearly looking for our order and then made our drinks very quickly. Obviously our food also had been forgotten as that took around 45 minutes. Poor poor service, if you recognize you made a mistake don't try and hide it, acknowledge it by offering a free drink or take a meal charge off the bill. Hiding it and hoping we don't mind you forgetting our order isn't acceptable!
