MZRqxvBkJLjKcoOjNz7yLA First came here in summer of 2015, had a rock'n good time at night with their open bar. Lots of people having a good time. Came back again in 2017, and this place had like a third of the people and the open bar price went up to $25 per person rather than $20. Stayed like 10 minutes the second time and left.
