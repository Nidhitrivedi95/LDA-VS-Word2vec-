vz8HFGsITt6aj-nyXkAEFg I'm still with the four stars...and that's GOOD! Consistent.

I would give them FIVE if:
* either fill my margarita glass to the tippy top or charge a little less than $6.50 OR add some tequila to it! At $6.50 a marg, (rocks) I'd hope for a little feeling of "ah, I've had a marg" but I don't get it and I'm something of a lightweight - especially at 106 degrees on the patio. (This marg is $5.50 on happy hour - I'd like to see it $5.00 all day, every day!)

Well, I guess that's my only beef! The service has been consistently conscientious, the food and portions reasonable and the patio is charming. That Queso Guillermo floats my boat (sinks my waistline though!) - it's the best plate of cheesy heaven - done just right. 

I did ask on my recent check-in about the fact that they won't serve you a small pitcher of margs unless two people are sitting down. (Small pitcher = 3 drinks) They will however, serve you three margaritas consecutively. Per my server, it's some AZ law regarding how much alcohol can be in front of someone. (Think of the ball games - each person can only buy so many oz of beer etc.) And here, I always think of this as the "wild west." I guess you can only get wild one drink at a time...and that the whole isn't greater than the sum of the tequila shots.  

Does that make sense? I wish they'd have served me one pitcher instead of five drinks ;) Oh, the math!

Note: just kidding...can't afford 5 margs LOL
