a8pmtlVKf7NiSLI-4KejIw Had a wonderful dinner here tonight!  I agree with some of the reviews, there are a few kinks that need to be worked out, but Marie D our waitress was amazing and the manager who was making the rounds seemed really on things.  

But most importantly - the food was amazing.  Stand-outs for us were the Baja tacos, the corn salad, guacamole, and the shrimp!  I will be dreaming about those tacos for days...

The one reco I would have for folks, is to order a few things, eat and then order more.  I love a leisurely dinner, and everything pretty much came out at once.  Understand that with tapas-style it can be tough, and to her credit, Marie did tell us that our food would likely come within 10-15 minutes of ordering, in whatever order it came up.  So we were forewarned...  And we weren't rushed at all, just was a bit overwhelming to have all the food there within a few minutes or each other.  

Also - we were there at 7ish and it was decently full and not too noisy.  As the night progressed and it got more full, the noise definitely went up (as expected, and not enough that we couldn't hear each other, but a point to note if you are looking for something on the quiet-side).  

I have to say, I have become a bit jaded about a lof ot these new, uber-hyped restos but this one is definitely worth checking out - and we all felt very well taken care of.  Plus the decor is absolutely gorgeous!  

Will definitely return!!!   Muchos gracias!
