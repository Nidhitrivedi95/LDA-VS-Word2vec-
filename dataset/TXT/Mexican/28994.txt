3X-jhrbCSMv5hfUS02xdHA I'm so happy Frank & Lupe's opened in Ahwatukee! I'm from New Mexico and love that style of Mexican food. I've been going to their Scottsdale location since I moved here in 2004. The food is delicious, chips and salsa great, and of course the margaritas are amazing! I'll be there frequently!
