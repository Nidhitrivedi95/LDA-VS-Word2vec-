tvESBMlJsaARw6hXoRCdjQ I was alone with my 2 year old daughter, and the man at the register made some really disgusting comments. The cashier's name on my receipt is Ricardo H. 
When ordering a taco, he asked if I wanted a hard or soft taco, and when I said hard, he made multiple comments about how I "like them hard" every time he talked about a taco. For my drink I said I wanted a large and the same comments were made about how I "like it big," it was when he put in my order, read my order back to me, and when he handed me my order. 
He also asked about my child and whether I had another- I told him that my husband and I did (taking the opportunity to mention my husband) and he asked if I planned on "making another one" with my husband. Not asking about a Child, asking about what I needed to do to get one. It was utterly disgusting. Ladies, please beware of the employees at this location.
