YQFcxE9UXrKc-QuTUu7twQ I visit this location often. Mainly due to the close proximity to my work office during lunch. Most days I find service to be prompt and food to be spot on. I do wish you had a taco Tuesday deal for those of us that have to grab and run due to our lunch schedule.  You definitely would get a lot more of our office's business. Anyways, keep up the great job on CS. The waitstaff is doing an outstanding job.
