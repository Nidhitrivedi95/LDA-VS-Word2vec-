frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A This place seems to be universally loved in Phoenix. It makes sense because the food is excellent. Every person I was with raved about the food afterwards. The salsa bar was also great. Lots of flavors to pick from and most were just the right amount of spicy. 

You really can't go wrong on the menu here. The burros (get them enchilada style) and the fried quesadillas are probably the most popular things and I'd recommend either of them. 

The reason I'm only giving 3 stars is because the service was extremely underwhelming. They were clearly understaffed (which seems to be a common theme for this restaurant), but it was extremely difficult to get hold of our waitress and we waiting close to 50 minutes for our food.
