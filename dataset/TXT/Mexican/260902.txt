VRwT0pscR5vESCrAnUpNwQ What a great new spot on King W! I was pleasantly surprised with their prices - everything is very affordable and you get amazing value for money. 

I usually start with their Guacamole and chips. You get generous serving of fresh delicious guacamole for only $4 (compare to ~$10 elsewhere). They have one of a kind salsa bar with fresh salsas, I think there use be at least 8 varieties, in all spice levels. Their salsa bar will sure satisfy any taste. My personal favorite is pineapple salsa - I can literally have it on its own, delish!

My favourite is beef fajitas - a generous serving of thinly sliced sizzling beef, accompanied by soft tortillas, guacamole, lettuce and other usual trimmings. 

For the healthy peeps out there - I recommend trying their kale salad, you can ago a topping of protein to it. Yum!
