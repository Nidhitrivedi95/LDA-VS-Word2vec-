6hRbVaaHX0DIKbxy2PFiiw Well Manuels  on Cavecreek Road has Lost something.  Complatiency no doubt.  Sodas were flat, service was slow, chips came a very long time after we sat down and finally when the food comes out I notice it wasn't oven fresh.  It was sitting out a while.  When the waiter said "Hot" plate I picked it up with my bare hands.  It was barely warm.  Unfortunately I won't be back.  I have given them many chances now.  Its just not the old Manuels of later days.  Do yourself a favor and keeping walking
