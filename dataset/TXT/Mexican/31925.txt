4kDLEb1OgE7IrO54lCkn3A I went here with my family and fiancee for a birthday dinner. We ordered a couple appetizers for the table and each got an entree. The food was really delicious and presented so beautifully. They have a lot of yummy Mexican drinks like hibiscus water and rice milk (which the server brought to my fiancee when he tried a super hot pepper). As someone who is gluten intolerant I liked that there was a star beside the items that weren't gluten free (which were only 2). The service was great, the atmosphere was really cozy and made you feel like you were in city in Mexico. They have a great patio out front as well as a good amount of seating inside. I hope to go back and try the Sangria :)
