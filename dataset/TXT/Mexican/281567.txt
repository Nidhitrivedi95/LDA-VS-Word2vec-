XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg The service was great, nice relaxed ambiance as well. Had the tuna appetizer and chicken black bean quesadilla they were both great , however the menu selection is really really short so if your looking for a variety of things you won't really find it here. My friend had the smoked salmon sandwich which she didn't really enjoy. My fiancé had the burger which he said was really good.
