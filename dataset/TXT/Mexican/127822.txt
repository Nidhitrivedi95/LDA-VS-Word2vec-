HWl2EbZhkhAkFgqt44yUkA Food portions were more than enough for us, we can't finish it =), Togo for night snacks. The dj last night was great, the girl who does the ballons hat was nice, she made them all with her creativities and are cute and pretty and the frog was great. Our server ( waitress with pony tail) was somehow rude, she just walked away after I told her my order. My friend was drunk and never said a work to her, I was the only person who had talked to her and placed our order, however she did check back on us once, but she actually just ask & look at my friend instead of me as if I was invisible, it seems like she doesn't even want to look at me at all but I'm actually gonna be the only person answering her (since my friend was drunk and didn't want to talk). So i don't know what exactly is wrong with her.
