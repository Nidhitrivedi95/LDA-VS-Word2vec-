joTw5858fDh3Y_rF0NDOsg Disappointed in the hostess that seated us.  She put us at a table that was right in the middle of a bunch of tables that had big families.  I don't have a problem with being around families but when there is just two of us and a lot of open tables I would prefer to sit away from the little kids.  When I asked the hostess for a different table she got an attitude.  She asked "where do you want to sit!" She lead us to a new table, dropped the menus and walked away like I really pissed her off.  We ordered drinks, mine was a margarita with no salt, it came and had salt.  My friend ordered a taco salad and it had a ton of sour cream on it. I had the soup and it was delicious.  I'm sure we'll go back again someday just not in the near future.
