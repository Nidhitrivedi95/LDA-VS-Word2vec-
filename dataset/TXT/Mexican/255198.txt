Looks like a small take out place with very few seatings, not super clean but has one of the best folks who serve food whole heartedly. Their options might be minimal but are the perfect  local food i have had. 

We ordered Pork burrito, chicken tacos and chicken burrito. Oh my gosh! the amount of meat they add u will be more than satisfied. U can add any topping, filling you want with no extra dollar. The tortillas are fresh, soft and delicious. Pork burrito is the best we have had so far, the meat so tender, its the tastiest burrito. The tacos I could easily eat 6 of those at once. Their sauce is very spicy so be very careful when u order. The jalapeno on the sides, just watch out.
Also they serve horchata, jamaica, tamarinda for drinks which are delicious. 

Overall great food at a even greater price. Go try if you want authentic no fancy Mexican food.
